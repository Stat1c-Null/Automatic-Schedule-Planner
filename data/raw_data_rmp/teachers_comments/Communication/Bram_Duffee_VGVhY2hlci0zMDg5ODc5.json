Reasonable word count & you'll get late credit. Not a hard grader and there's 3 tests. also a journal due at the end of the course that you just answer prompts every unit. 1 video assignment but it's super easy and the discussions can be fun.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjI4MTUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1100","date_posted":"2025-05-06 05:00:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do make sure you actually read the textbook. Unfortunately there is a lot to read and the discussion posts, quizzes, and lecture videos will NOT prepare you for the midterm and final.

He responds to emails quickly. He's very understanding and there is no reason as to why you shouldn't receive an A in this class. He gives lesson videos about the units and goes in depth about topics. I would only say keep up with the course journal, if you do it last minute it will be time consuming!
