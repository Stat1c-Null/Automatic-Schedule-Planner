His demeanor is very straight to the point and blunt. His critique does help you if you want to actually become a better writer. There are a lot of hands-on projects like videos and podcasts. I would take him again, but probably in person next time.

He grades everything on a 5 point scale.  This means that there is no nuance in the grades and leads to a situation where you can lose a lot points easily.
