I have zero interest in the topic, but LOVED the class. I actually enjoyed learning how to use Photoshop and Adobe InDesign. A few minor quizzes, so it's good to take some notes. No exams. Just design projects, all solo and you can do them in class and/or at home. Very simple! One of the few COM classes I'd call fun.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTE2NTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM3301","date_posted":"2013-08-14 12:28:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is one of my favorite COMM professors so far!
