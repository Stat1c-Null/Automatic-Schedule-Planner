I didn't think I'd like being in a room with 90 students but her topics were interesting and students are grouped for discussions and projects. She loves to teach and it shows. Her tests are more from her powerpoints than the book. Take her--but know that she has a tough attendance policy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTM4MTAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1109","date_posted":"2012-11-15 09:20:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was so easy! She doesn't go over the power points because she gets so distracted, but she puts them all online. If you do the study guide for that tests you should get an A. One drawback is that you're placed in a group. Make sure you take it with a friend! It's a pointless, boring, easy class. Definitely take her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODQwNjE1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1109","date_posted":"2012-11-05 22:21:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not well organized.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzgzMDM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1101","date_posted":"2012-10-22 12:23:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is okay not the best or worst. She is very unorganized and does give ALOT of homework. The test are not to bad if you do the study sheet which takes 4evr and isnt straight foward so its alot of work. Your in groups in this class the entire semester which can be a good or bad thing. over all unless I had too I would'nt take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzIzMTcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2135","date_posted":"2012-05-22 13:51:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is really nice, but does give out a lot of homework.

She is a nice lady but sometimes the assignments are unclear and everything is graded on 100% accuracy (even if you got the right answer but just used the wrong editing symbol).

She is a sweet person but as a professor she is rarely prepared for class and is never clear on assignments. The class is already difficult as it is, she makes it ten times harder.
