His class ended up being my favorite. He makes law and ethics interesting. You gain good friendships in his class through discussions and group presentations. Not quite an easy A because the midterm and final are challenging but it is possible to get an A in his class with minimal studying.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzIyMDA2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2240","date_posted":"2019-11-11 14:28:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am currently in his class and I hate it. He requires everyone to participate EVERY CLASS, and his lectures are SO boring. Hes a really sweet guy, but a little awkward. I do not advise taking him. Like 5 or 6 people took a W for his class cause they hated it so much.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzkxNTAy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
