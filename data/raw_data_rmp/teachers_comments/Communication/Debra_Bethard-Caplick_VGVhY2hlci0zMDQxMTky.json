I'm excited to be taking another class of hers next semester. Her lectures are long, but full of good information. The tests don't include things that weren't covered and most of what you learn is applicable to finding a career. The exercises are interesting and there's extra credit. Very kind and genuinely wanted to help me.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTQyOTQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PR-3335","date_posted":"2025-05-01 19:58:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a good one!!

I have heard that her in-person class was great, but I do not recommend her online class. She was so unorganized, none of her assignments and due dates matched up, and I felt like it was always a guessing game on what was due.
