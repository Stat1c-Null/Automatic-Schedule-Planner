There is a group tax research memo with 4-6 people, but that was easy.  You really don't need to come to class, just on the day you pick groups. The prof is pretty entertaining too, and she's really sweet. Such an easy A!

She will give out extra credit points if you attend certain classes. I will say that her lectures are confusing and I did not learn a lot from them. She went over some practice problems in class but was not the best at explaining their concepts.
