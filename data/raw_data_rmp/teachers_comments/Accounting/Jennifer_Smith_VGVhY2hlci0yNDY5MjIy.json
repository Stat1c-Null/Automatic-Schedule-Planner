She really cares about the subject and she wants you to pass the class and really understand the material. The tests are hard but she gives opportunities to get some points back with corrections.

I really like her and would take her again if she stays here and teaches upper level classes. Its hard to make accounting lectures interesting but she really tries to engage the class and does a lot of examples in class.
