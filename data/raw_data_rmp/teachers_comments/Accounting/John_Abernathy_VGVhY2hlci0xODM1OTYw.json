This professor knows his stuff and is so amazingly helpful if you show up to office hours. Really a great person who cares about you and your grade and loves his work. Attendance is helpful as the material for an intro class can be immense (if not your major) but you will be prepared for 2200!

Very funny and down-to-earth personality. Makes class enjoyable. Took the course during the summer, yet he took the time to make sure you understood the material. The course material is pretty tough to begin with and requires a high level of understanding of accounting.

He really cares about his students. It was his first year at KSU but has experience and is always there to help you out. Don't need book, but he assigns online homeworks. He's pretty funny and keeps class interesting. I'm not interested in accounting, and I think I'll make an A.

Makes jokes and really wants his class to understand.  If you study and ask questions you should do fine. He could however use more tools on Mcgraw hill connect like the chapter review questions.
