Easy to learn from and hw was available to work at your own pace quizzes every week and Exams were a little difficult but he helps you understand the concept in class.

He is very understanding with grading and a great professor overall. His tests are difficult, but he provides a study guide that encompasses all the content and math needed. The test grades are also very large, but grades from weekly assignments saturate it a good bit.

I recommend watching the videos at the beginning of each section, doing your homework, and studying the test reviews. If you do all that, you should be able to get a decent grade if not an A. He's a good professor. Very kind and helpful.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTExMTA3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2018-01-03 22:07:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not the best teacher but knows his stuff. Goes rather quickly at times and tends to over complicate things. A few weeks in I realized that the textbook videos at the beg. of each section were the best. I basically learned 90% of the material through those vids and passed the class with a 99 while most others were struggling.

He does practice problems in class to review the material. Attendance does count but there is just a sheet at the front of the room. He gives a study guide before each test and pulls 30 of the 50 study guide questions ( just changes some numbers) and he curves too.

Does not give time for students to grasp content. Just shows you his Excel spreadsheet and then reveals the answer by coloring the cell red.

I had and have no interest in accounting but I managed to keep a B on the border of an A. He uses the Homework Manager and its worth a small chunk of your overall grade.
