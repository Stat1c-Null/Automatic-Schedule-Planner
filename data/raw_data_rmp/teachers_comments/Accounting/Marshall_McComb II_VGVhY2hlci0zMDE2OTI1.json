Quizzes are done in class but he usually announces them the class before so you could prepare yourself. Test are open note and practices similar test the class before. Overall, you just have to put in the work like any other class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTkzNDI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"accounting","date_posted":"2025-01-24 18:41:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Meh...this guy was ok. Honestly, I learned more from the book and have been inspired more by non-accounting teachers than this guy. He's nice but ineffective as a teacher in my opinion. He gives out points like candy on Halloween, which is great if you want an easy A. If he reads this, I think he should change his approach to teaching the class.

I was wrong. It was horrible. it was 3 hours of my life sucked out of me every week sometimes more. The tests are taken through a app called proctor where someone stares at you 1 on 1 with 2 cameras. I never thought a professor would care that much without teaching ONCE.
