Departmental mandated Exams are Monitor EDU enabled and excel project just like on 2101. Accounting is NOT for the lazy or procrastinators. Use of all your tutoring resources GTA's, Learning Center and if you are \"desperate\" Knack. Take Her!

Those rating her low did not apply themselves nor used all the available resources (GTA sessions, Learning Center and Kack Tutoring). Prof Pryor is an AMAZING human being.

There are only four exams the entire semester that about 60% of your grade. She is not very communitive and emails go unanswered for more then a week, and some emails that were sent was time urgent and she didn't reply until after the deadline passed. Not much help with studying to prepare us for the exams.
