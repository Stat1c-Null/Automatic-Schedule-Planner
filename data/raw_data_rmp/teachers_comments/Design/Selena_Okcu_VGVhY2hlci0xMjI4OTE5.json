She explains each topic clearly and makes it a class that everyone could understand and do well. What was very helpful was the videos that she did throughout the semester covering all the material in case we missed one step, which in certain times were very helpful. I would definitely take her again. 10/10","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjI1NjQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH2242","date_posted":"2024-11-14 14:55:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"You are making an Excellent choice if you are taking Professor Okcu for Decom.

She'll tell you to do one thing then completely changes her mind and makes you figure out what she wants. Ive asked questions multiple times and she just walks away.

I usually don't come and write reviews on... anything, really, but man I really need to emphasize that if you take DCOMM, PLEASE PLEASE take Okcu!

She will actually go over things that you may have missed in past years or if you can't remember how to do it she will show you right quick. She understands that studio may come first in some instances but if you want to get an A you will have to put in the work. \n","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjQ5Nzg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1241","date_posted":"2022-05-12 02:12:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Decom I with Professor Okcu and I wouldn't have it any other way!
