There is an end of semester project, but she gives you options and wants you to be creative with it. Also reached out to students mid semester to see if anyone has any feedback for her. I recommend her.

Despite her strict grading, her feedback was minimal and unhelpful (for discussion posts/papers). The workload wasn't excessive, but it was detailed and time-consuming. No clear responses by email either.
