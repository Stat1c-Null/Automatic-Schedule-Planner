He responded quickly to emails as well. Few assignments, which I appreciated during the summer. Would take him again if I could.

His class is easy; however, it moves fast. The test was open-notes, which are extremely helpful. no lockdown + webcam. Would take him again by any chance.

Lots of lectures, were pretty boring. 2 papers, one is the final. One test the midterm. A few discussion posts but everything was pretty easy.
