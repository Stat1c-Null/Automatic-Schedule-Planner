Weekly exams, several quizzes, and long discussion posts required time management. The exams were typically 35 question and two written responses. When responding to someone that was writing a whole new post. The professor is very specific, but fair.

Very helpful. Had one big paper but her progress reports on the project help you with feedback. Tests were tough but if you come to all her lectures she lets you use notes, so you must take good notes! Very straightforward.

Grading was so picky I'd call upon the divine power of the gods to help me. Minus points for overwriting. TWO 5-page papers, MIDTERM, and FINAL w/ 3 essay questions.

Gives FANTASTIC feedback on DB's/essays. A tad nitpicky, but will only take off a point or two for inconsistencies as long as you genuinely try.
