His lectures are amazing and yes attendance is mandatory, if you miss a day it's okay just communicate with him. and he offers internships to his students.

He's also such a great and caring person, and a great connection to have if you want to get into the CJ field. One group project which is very easy. Attendance matters but you can still miss days and get an A. Absolutely take him, I genuinely loved going to class and actually learned a lot.

You're only graded on a midterm, final, and group project at the end of the term. The tests are only ten questions each and super easy. He does grade attendance, so just show up and do the project and you're pretty much guaranteed an A.

If you want an A then Attendance is Mandatory. He makes his lectures seem like he's having a conversation which makes his class fun. I would take him again for sure. I've taken him twice and so far class has been great, if you answer questions then he'll speed up class.

He loves group discussions, answering any questions we have about his career, and will do anything he can to help you succeed.
