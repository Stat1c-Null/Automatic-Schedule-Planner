She can not teach; she was very disrespectful, and she accused us of using AI while using it herself. She was a heavy grader on every little thing. This is from me to you all.

A ton of written assignments that she would accuse multiple students of using AI. One girl wrote two sentences and she was accused of using chat gpt and was reported.
