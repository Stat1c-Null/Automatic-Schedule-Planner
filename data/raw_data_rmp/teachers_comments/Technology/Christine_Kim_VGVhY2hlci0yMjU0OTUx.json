A must-take for textiles for sure.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDc1OTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART3830","date_posted":"2025-04-28 21:39:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took ART3840 with Professor Kim this semester, and she was great.

Her class was more group project heavy than anticipated but you can pick your group and kick out anyone who slacks on their work. Taking notes is the key to an A, so go to class.
