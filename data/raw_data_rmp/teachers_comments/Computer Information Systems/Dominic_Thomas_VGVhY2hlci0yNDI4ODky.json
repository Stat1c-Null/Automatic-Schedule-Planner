Grades consist mainly of weekly Python modules/quizzes, demo projects, exercises here and there, and the semester project which are all easy if you ask questions when you need to and go to class. He factors in event participation into attendance, too.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDkwMDA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS3220","date_posted":"2019-12-05 14:42:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Thomas exceeded my expectations for the class.

It's essentially a Python 101. If you're taking this in the summer, make it your only class. He's a nice and generous grader. He just wants you to do your best. You need our own computer. He grades for participation. Ask questions. He loves to help.

He is always accessible whether it be by email, office hours, or even Groupme. He wants all of his students to learn and understand Python.

Class is somewhat running itself. Strict attendance policy get more than 5 absences &amp; expect your grade to drop by 10%. Assignments were pulled from the sky. Not a clear understanding of what is expected for project. Likes to micromanage the class a lot. Gives busy work just to say he's doing something to show to higher ups.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODA5Mjgz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?
