I found a few of his assignments to be challenging and time consuming. Lots of easy quizzes. Group project was a good bit of work, but he's an easy grader.

As I kept going through the semester I liked his teaching style more and more. He knows that everyone in his class is capable of getting an A, the students just have to want it.

The lectures, while interesting, were irrelevant to the class. The online quizzes are from the book and are fairly easy.

His lectures are dry as he just reads straight off the powerpoint. Occasionally he talks about interesting things but they have little to do with the projects or quizzes. Projects VERY CONFUSING.

Never answered a single email this semester (I've sent 6). Gave us a coding project without teaching us anything about coding and then cancelled the assignment 3 hours before it was due.

Going to class counts in your favor. Will be considerate if he sees your effort. Lectures aren't that helpful. Weekly quizzes straight from textbook, midterm, and final.
