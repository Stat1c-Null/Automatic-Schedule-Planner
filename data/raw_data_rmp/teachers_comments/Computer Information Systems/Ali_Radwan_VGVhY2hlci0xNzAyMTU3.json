If you are unfortunately forced to take him, don't sign up for the class. I am an optimistic student and always try to assume the best out of a professor, but I can say that the rating doesn't do him justice. He is much worse. Save your mental health and take a gap semester. He is extremely rude for someone I pay to teach me.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODEwMTQx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS01","date_posted":"2021-12-05 17:00:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very large communication barrier with this prof.
