Great professor. Grades are only labs and tests. If you do poorly on one, it is hard to get the grade back up. Great lectures, kinda funny. Chill class, attendance not mandatory, you don't have to talk. Go to class or miss out on good lectures. No extra credit. Great feedback.

Tests, quizzes, and homework are all elementary. The key is paying attention in class since he likes to base all the test and quiz materials on the lectures and slides.

He doesn't try to bore you with plant anatomy but instead curtails his class to be appealing for many premeds, he even pulls references to the human body and uses cute little salamander slides to explain concepts.
