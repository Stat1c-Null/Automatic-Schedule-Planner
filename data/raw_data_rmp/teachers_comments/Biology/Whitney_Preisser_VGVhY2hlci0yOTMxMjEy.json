She does go fast through the lectures but she posts them online so you can look at them later. All of her test questions come straight from the powerpoint, so as long as you study that you will do well. Her class was very interesting and she is very knowledgeable.  10/10!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTkxMTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL4115","date_posted":"2025-01-07 08:28:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very great at her job. She does tend to quickly go through slides so be prepared to review outside of class. Exams and quizzes are straight from the slides and some questions may come from something she said in class. Mostly a memorization class so get in the habit of studying with flash cards. Overall I feel like I gained more than what I expected","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDk4NzY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Caring--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL4115","date_posted":"2024-10-04 16:46:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you take her lab, you better be pushy in order to participate in anything. Often there were not enough supplies, and if you're not one of the loud or pushy students, you'll be left basically just observing. Not to mention the lab lasts only about half the semester.

In class, she flies through slides so fast you can barely keep up, I recorded lectures myself b/c there was nothing online if you missed it in class. She does care though & allowed for a lot of corrections which is the only reason why I passed.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTMxNTMy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL4115","date_posted":"2024-01-03 21:42:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor for parasitology. Lecture heavy. Easy assignments, hard tests. Gives great feedback. Some extra credit, gives test corrections. Really wants you to do great class. Available outside class. Brings in cool specimens. Go to her office hours, she has snacks. STUDY STUDY STUDY. It is a hard class, but if you really try you will succeed.

Many parasites and it seemed that some were just dumped on us. Exams became easier as the semester went through. Dr. Preisser listened to what everyone had said and made the exams easier as well as giving bonus points and assignments. She is very sweet and caring.

First exam was 95% short answer and 2% MC and matching. 24ish species to know the life cycle, phylum, symptoms, diagnosis and like 4 other things for each exam. You can do corrections at the end for 50% of your points back and she is kind so that is a plus. But other professors teach this class so take them instead.
