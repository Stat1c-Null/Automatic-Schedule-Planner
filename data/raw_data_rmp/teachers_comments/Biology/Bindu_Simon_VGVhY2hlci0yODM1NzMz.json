One of my easiest classes. She gives you the option of joining a Zoom or attending in person. Only grades were quizzes, super quizzes, and weekly homework. She also gives many opportunities for bonus points, so I was able to end the class with over an 100%. She's super understanding about difficulties and easy to reach.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTg0MDM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Graded by few things--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GENETICSLAB","date_posted":"2022-12-01 16:27:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took professor Simon for my genetics lab. She was great. She cares about her students and wants you to succeed. If you do well on the midterm you dont have to take the final. There is a poster at the end, but she makes it easy and straightforward. I ended up with an A. Would definitely take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTM0MjIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL1107","date_posted":"2022-11-01 20:38:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"provides outside materials including uploading recordings of every chapter and hosting a zoom during every classShe did kahoots that counted for attendance but they were completion.
