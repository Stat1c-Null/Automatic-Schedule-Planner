Attendance wasn't mandatory but i recommend attending class and Labs because he can possibly give extra credit. I'd also recommend looking up quizlets for his exams to help understand the material because he didn't give out a study guide.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTM0MjM0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL3375","date_posted":"2024-08-14 17:59:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take him for behavioral bio! SUPER EASY. For context, I didn't show up to a SINGLE lab and only went to class the first week of school, and ended with an A. Labs are straightforward and instructions are on d2l, so no need to show up. Classes are recorded on d2l from previous semesters. Exams are online with lockdown browser but no camera.

Lectures mostly pictures on a powerpoint so need to engage in the class to take notes. Tests are in depth and can be difficult, however, they are taken online in lockdown at any point on test day, so you can do it at home. 2 labs at Zoo ATL, and don't have a lab every week. No labs during test week either.

Took him for behavioral. He's full of examples, can't get away from cowbirds for some reason. Lectures are clear. Posts his slides and lab materials including a rubric. You'll know exactly what will be on the test in advance. If you follow the rubric on his labs you'll ace them. He's a harsh grader but he follows the rubric like his bible so just stick to that.
