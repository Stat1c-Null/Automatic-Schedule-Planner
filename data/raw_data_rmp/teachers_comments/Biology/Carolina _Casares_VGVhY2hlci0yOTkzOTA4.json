Make sure you check for pre-and post lab quizzes for every week. Take her.

I took her for Culture of Science and Math. Her class consisted of mainly conversations about life stories and scenarios, but I wasn't mad at it. Super caring and just wants you to do well.

Doesn't do a good job at explaining content, but is a easy grader. Typically lets us out of lab early.

She talks about nothing for forever and gives you no time to actually do the stuff that needs to be done because she TALKS SO MUCH ABOUT NOTHING. She's totally unorganized too, i never know exactly what we're doing every time I come to class. Its not a hard class but she's INCREDIBLY frustrating.

He was extremely helpful and gave clear instructions and guidelines. You must attend every class and complete all the tedious tasks, such as reading through the lab worksheets before each class and taking your pre- and post-labs. I had so much fun and had a wonderful group.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDA4NTU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL4486","date_posted":"2024-07-17 14:41:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"lovely professor loves conversations during lectures and tells a lot of side stories lol.
