If you have a choice, I wouldn't recommend him.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEwODUyNjk4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2107","date_posted":"2005-11-07 18:19:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Lester is good teacher and is enthusiastic about teaching, but the lectures are boring, as is the subject matter...the test and quizzes are easy enough if you go to class, but the lab report is a joke (too much work for VERY little points)...easy teacher, but won't learn much","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEwODQ0Nzcy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1102","date_posted":"2005-02-23 18:58:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"easy going, and laid back.. but makes you jump through hoops on silly group projects.tests are easy enough. skip class. read lecture notes on webct.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODc4OTU=","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
