She's compassionate and available outside class (emails quick). Personable, easy to talk with and ask questions. Reports due shortly after lab (couple days) so be ready, though they're fairly easy. Goes over many answers before you start so if you pay attention you will do well!

Only one worksheet and 2 quizzes per week, which can all be completed during or right after the lab. Attendance mandatory, but sometimes make-up labs are available if you miss one.

She explains the lab thoroughly and makes sure that you understand it. She's also super approachable and kind, so don't be afraid to ask questions.

Wish that she taught Bio Lab 2, so I could take her again! She explains in depth every single lab, and is always ready to answer questions. Her rubrics are so easy, and she explains them so we can get max points. She takes most of the lab worksheets for completion, and drops the lowest post and pre quiz!
