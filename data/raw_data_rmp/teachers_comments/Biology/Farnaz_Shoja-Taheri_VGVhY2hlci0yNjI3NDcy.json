Point blank take it. She is one of the easiest professors Ive had a Kennesaw. All of her test and quizzes are easy if you study and go to class. She is super sweet and responds to emails quickly. Only thing I didnt care for was the group work, which is weekly.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzgzODcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO1107","date_posted":"2021-04-27 22:24:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor, but there was entirely too much group work, it was getting tiring after awhile. She assigns group work in class once a week, so if you skip class you wont be able to do the group work. Homework and quizzes weekly. Lectures were recorded. She sometimes did polls to determine attendance and class participation, so just go to class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjQwMTU4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

We had textbook work every week that would take a while to complete but over all not too difficult. As with any class, lots to memorize but she does a good job to help students understand what's going on. Only thing I didn't like was the amount of group work we did, which was hard to coordinate with people.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzI2MjAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
