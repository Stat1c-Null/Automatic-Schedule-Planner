If it isn't mandatory to take this class, don't. Save your money, time, and mental health. The labs test and project are all using ArcGis. Software that you may have 0 experience with. You will spend countless hours trying to do these activities.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNDkwNDUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lots of homework--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG3315","date_posted":"2025-05-14 00:28:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you don't have to take this class, maybe don't, but don't be intimidated if you do. \n\nTime-consuming? 1000% but not impossible. I would take this in a lighter semester. Focus on following directions, and you will be ok. He will help you SO MUCH with your project, but you need to ask. Do all the quizzes/discussions, it helps your grade A LOT.

Technology that is bound to screw up. The work itself isn't hard, but it's a lot. The hardest part about the class is managing all of the technology\nYou have to jump through hoops every week to figure these different programs out. They glitch out a lot.

He did not even make most of the modules that he teaches with, and asking him questions about how they work can be pointless. He took points off an assignment and claimed I did not do part of the work, and I had to email him to actually grade my work.
