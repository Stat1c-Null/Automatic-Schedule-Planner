All my friends said it would be an easy A but not with this professor. Attendance is mandatory but he reads straight from the power points which he puts on line. The labs are awful and the test are way to hard than they should be. Grades are returned very late. Extra credit is offered because its so necessary!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjY2ODc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1113","date_posted":"2013-11-04 19:10:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"worst class ever. He doesn't make the labs, and whoever does make them is inaccurate on locations and elevations. He doesn't put in much effort, but is nice. He is hard to understand, and the tests are very hard. i recommend NOT taking this class ever. it will cause only stress.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjU0NDg5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
