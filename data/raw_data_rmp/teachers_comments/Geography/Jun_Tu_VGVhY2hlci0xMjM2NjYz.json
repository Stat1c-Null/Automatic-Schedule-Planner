Some of his assignments (especially the 2 from the book) had outlandish scenarios that were difficult to form a solid answer. Labs could be confusing. Test are diffult but if you study some you can pass. Not an easy class but manageable.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTA2MDk0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1112","date_posted":"2013-11-05 14:55:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Somewhat of a hard accent to understand, but overall a great teacher.

Labs split into two classes. One group gets the short end of stick; he gives the test with the last lab content before the lab class gets to do the lab.

His accent made it a bit hard to understand sometimes, but overall it wasn't a problem. His powerpoints are very thorough, and he posts them online. He doesn't make study guides for exams, but he tells you in class what questions to expect on the test.
