We had 2 labs due (Tuesday and Thursday) and a test every Friday. The tests were straight from the book. Dr. Pullen's draw back is her inability to answer emails or discussion posts in a timely manner when this was a 4 week, 4 credit hour course. I would probably take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTY3NTg5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1113","date_posted":"2012-05-04 15:06:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her online class and it was alright at best.
