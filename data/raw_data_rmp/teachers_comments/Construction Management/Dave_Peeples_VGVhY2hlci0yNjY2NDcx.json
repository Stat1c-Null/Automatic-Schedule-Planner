He was assigned this class 3 days before the summer semester began. Professor Peeples did an ok job handling assignments. He is a middle of the road professor. Not too difficult, Not neccessarily easy. He is understanding and accessible out of class. Lectures are extremely boring.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTI0Mjgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3110","date_posted":"2025-07-22 01:46:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a nice professor and will work with you if need help. His assignments are a bit confusing and he often confuses himself while trying to explain the class and homework. Again, really nice teacher but I would not recommend him if this class is for a credit. Attendance matters and there is random pop quizzes that are easy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTE1Mjc1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3110","date_posted":"2025-03-31 04:28:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor is very condescending in emails and grades off a very unclear scope with the slightest difference in answers completely negating any points.

I would literally recommend taking him if possible. He is very lecture heavy, and it can be boring. He does have some pop quizzes, but they're mostly done to take attendance. Pop quizzes are also very random!! I had no trouble with him & overall a great professor!!
