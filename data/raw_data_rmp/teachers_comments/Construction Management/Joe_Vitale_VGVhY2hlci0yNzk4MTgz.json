He is very easy to understand and creates a comfortable and interactive environment during class. He also has decades of experience in the construction field which shows based off of his lectures. Would absolutely recommend to anybody with a construction management degree.

Classes consisted of just labs and 3 exams. Those exams are online and the labs are in person so you have to be in class. But sometimes will assign labs outside of class. Great prof overall though and funny guy.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDc1ODU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM4230","date_posted":"2022-12-14 17:06:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class consists of only five exams which are math heavy, but they are open note/textbook. Attendance is not required but you do need to go to class to take notes to pass the exams. Regardless, he is a great laid back professor that is very experienced in heavy construction.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTE2ODkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3440","date_posted":"2022-05-09 13:24:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great choice of a professor. This class only consists of tests, attendance and a final project at the end of the semester. He gives lectures every class that follow with an open note test every unit. Final project can be time consuming, but he offers a few classes that consist of going over the project and is very helpful.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mjg0MjYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3170","date_posted":"2022-05-09 13:18:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Vitale is a great choice. Grading is simple, only tests and attendance. He gives lectures every class and then has open note tests. No quizzes, no homework and no projects. He has some interesting stories that tie into the lectures as he works in the heavy construction industry. It is a very straight forward class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mjg0MjI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
