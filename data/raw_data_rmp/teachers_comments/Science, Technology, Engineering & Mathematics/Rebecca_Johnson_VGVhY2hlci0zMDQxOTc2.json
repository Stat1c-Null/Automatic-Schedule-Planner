This was by far the worst professor I've had in college so far and I'm an upcoming senior. Her tests are actually impossible to get a good grade on and they're all 50 questions with no curve. She doesn't know how to use D2L or any technology for that matter. Please if you care about your GPA don't take her.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTIxNDY2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCM2000","date_posted":"2025-05-02 01:19:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Rebecca Johnson for my online bio lab and it was lightwork.

Always was open to helping. Some assignments were a bit confusing but having group assignments saved me in so much confusion. You will be stuck with one group for the whole semester so pick a good group!! The work wasn't super heavy it was relatively light compared to other courses I was taking.

Will drop you a letter grade if you miss more than 2 unexcused absences during the semester. Lots of group work because of what the class is. She cares and will help if you don't get something.
