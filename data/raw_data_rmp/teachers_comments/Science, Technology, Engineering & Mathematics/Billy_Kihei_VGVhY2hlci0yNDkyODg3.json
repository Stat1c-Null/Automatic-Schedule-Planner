He cares about his students and will take time to explain things to you over and over. Definitely go to his office hours if you are struggling. His exams are somewhat difficult.

However, I would not advise anyone to take this course without programming knowledge. This course is also project-heavy.

My issues with him stem from the CPE 1000L itself, because the structure is terrible. Everything is done in a group (so pray you get a good one) and since it's the entry class for CPE, it's not assumed you know Python. Despite that, you are expected to write some VERY difficult code","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjUzMDc1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Accessible outside class--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CPE1000","date_posted":"2024-03-27 21:23:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Your grade in the class is determined by assignments, attendance, and weekly quizzes.

As for the quizzes, they are very short and the questions are about random things and sometimes his opinions that he slightly mentions the previous week.

He refuses to help and tells you to look things up because you can't be the first person with a problem.

Great. Especially if CPE or something in that mix is what you want, he really opens you up to all the options you could make for a career. He doesn't grade too hard, he just wants you to show that you made an effort on his assignments.
