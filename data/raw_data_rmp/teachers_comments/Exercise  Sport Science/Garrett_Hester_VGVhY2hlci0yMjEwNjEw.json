So a C is achieve-able. Only has one opportunity for 4 extra credit points. Only take him if its your 2nd option not first in my opinion.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDcxOTUw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES4500","date_posted":"2024-01-18 21:20:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hester is great! In order to get an A, you have to show up to class and fill out the PowerPoints. If you pay attention to the slides with stars, you will ace his tests! The quizzes are open note.

After the craziness of ex phys 1, I was very nervous to take the second part. He made this class approachable and I ended up doing better than I ever thought. 3 tests with short answer/MC , open note quizzes, a group project, and a final. He is a very approachable person and a good choice for ex phys 2","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjYxMTM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Test heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES4300","date_posted":"2021-06-03 03:55:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy and amazing professor.
