A 300 word discussion post and 5 question quiz every week. Assigns multiple (long) chapters to read weekly along with movies you must purchase independently. The amount of work this lady assigns is absolutely ridiculous for a gen ed class. She acts as if that's the only class students have.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzY1OTk2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2019-12-16 19:42:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall, not a bad class. The class is made up of quizzes and discussion posts each week. The discussion posts are easy but the quizzes are pretty hard. They are both based on the textbook so I prefer getting it online to navigate it easier. The quizzes are only ever 5 questions. The final was not bad.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjc5MjI3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Accessible outside class--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2019-12-04 16:12:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor McFarland takes this class very seriously, so if you dont she will know. There are quizzes from a very weird novel every week that are impossible to find online, but in class you just watch movies. Its an easy A besides the quizzes.. so I recommend getting an online version you can control f with to find answers!

As long as you do all the readings and partipate in discussions, its an easy A. All of the graded assignments are on d2l and theyre mostly discussion posts and 5 question quizzes over the readings.

I had quite a few health related issues this semester, and she was more than understanding about it. You can tell she really cares about her students. You can tell where her opinions stand on multiple issues, but she is very open to understanding other points of view.
