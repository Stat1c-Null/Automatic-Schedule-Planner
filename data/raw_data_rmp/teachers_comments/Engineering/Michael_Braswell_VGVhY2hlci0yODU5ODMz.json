If I wasn't as good as I was at Solidworks, I would have a hard time because he really does not teach that much, just powerpoint lectures.

Heavily hands off as he expects you to learn instantly from a textbook. Also very unorganized and lacks passion. This is not a professor, he is simply there to tell you when exams are and what chapters to read over. Does one problem and concludes that is enough.

Because everyone I talk to hates this guy. He is not willing to work with you, and half the time in lecture he is either complaining about your class or not teaching.
