She will also give extensions/extra credit if she sees the class struggling overall. She has a great attitude &amp; overall disposition as well. There is a language barrier &amp; disorganization to her course structure, but it's not too bad once you get acclimated.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjE4NDM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MTRE2610","date_posted":"2021-01-10 23:31:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"You can tell Dr. Sha tries to teach well, but a lot of times she can be hard to understand, and sometimes misunderstands questions that students have. She is a caring professor who grades VERY kindly. She is a better teacher in person than online, so the class being 80% online is a big factor. Only take her if you have programming experience.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjYwNTQz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MTRE2610","date_posted":"2020-09-28 16:43:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Sha is hard to understand, and her lectures are confusing. If you want to teach yourself how to program, I welcome you to take her class. She is knowledgeable in programming and caring, she just lacks the ability to teach well. The reason she has a 2 instead of 1 is because I can tell she IS trying to teach, she's just not good at it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjY2NDgz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MTRE1000","date_posted":"2019-03-15 20:25:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Sha is the sweetest. She is very friendly and fun. I had her for my MTRE 1000 lab, and she was always helpful. She does have an accent, but it isn't a problem unless you get mad about her not being able to say your name 100% correctly to your native tongue. She taught my friends and I a little Chinese in our free time which is cool.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDQxMzU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
