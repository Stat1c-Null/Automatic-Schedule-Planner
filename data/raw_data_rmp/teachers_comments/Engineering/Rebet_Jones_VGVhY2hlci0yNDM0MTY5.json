Some group members didn't contribute, and I hope grades reflected that. His tests are straightforward and lectures are clear. He encourages independence, which I appreciated, and he's very accessible outside of class for questions. A solid professor who prepares you for the real world.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzIxMTcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET4135","date_posted":"2024-11-26 01:43:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"IET 3620***  Professor Jones was such a great professor this semester.
