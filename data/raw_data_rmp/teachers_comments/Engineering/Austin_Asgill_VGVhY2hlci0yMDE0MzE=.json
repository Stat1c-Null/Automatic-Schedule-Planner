Tons of HW for every class that he never looks at and grades off participation. Doesnt update his syllabus we got 1/4 through the semester before he told us WE had the wrong book.

Never works out problems on the board, it was him showing you a worked example from the text book on the board and just talking about it. Most of the time sat in lab with headphones in or just not there and when you ask him for help, he is not helpful at all.
