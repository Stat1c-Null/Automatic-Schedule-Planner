Most skipped and did zero coding. Group project/presentation was 60% of the grade. Prerecorded videos so low/no interaction with the professor. No peer evaluation at the end to report being used for a free grade. Not writing an email to make myself a target.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTI1NDQ4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE6733","date_posted":"2022-08-03 22:22:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great lectures online.  Very relaxed and open to questions and discussion.  Encourages participation and is comfortable with interruptions.  Keeps on track to finish the lecture, but sometimes ends off early (or goes over a minute or two) if he's done/not-done with what he had planned to cover.  Very easy to understand.  Very knowledgeable.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTYxMDQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE6733","date_posted":"2022-04-17 22:59:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you want a professor to just sit back, read slides and assign 3 semester projects you have the perfect professor.
