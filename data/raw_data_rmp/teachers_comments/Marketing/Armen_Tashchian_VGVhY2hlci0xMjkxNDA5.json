Lectures jump around - skips slides...'you can review later'. Appears unprepared for class, tries to be funny - to hide his lack of teaching skill.  All lectures (2/3 of classes) on single exam. Case studies & presentations last few classes.  Grades slow to get back, waits to last minute.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTcyOTEz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG8030","date_posted":"2011-04-23 12:15:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Tashchian is the best professor in the marketing department in terms of teaching ability, but he is certainly not the easiest.  The workload is fair, but the tests are very hard.  He still gives you the benefit of the doubt in grading any essays or papers.  He's definitely the preferred professor for MKTG 8030.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDU2MjE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4100","date_posted":"2010-07-24 16:43:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good teacher, willing to help if you ask. Tests are hard; multiple choice with tricky/confusing questions. Many questions come from the textbook. Takes attendance.

Extremely knowledgeable and helpful if you ask.  A good group is very important as you do have quite a bit of work, 2 group cases, a marketing plan, weekly quizes,and an individual case for a final.

Ridiculously hard tests.
