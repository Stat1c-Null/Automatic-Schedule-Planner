If she thinks you did, you fail the grade entirely. The exams were hard as well. She was not friendly when emailing or asking questions. Would not ever take this class again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDk3NzA4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4820","date_posted":"2024-12-04 23:51:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Ramey genuinely cares and wants you to succeed in the class. She has interesting lectures but does go a little fast sometimes. She is very considerate of the class and would often take votes on extending deadlines or content she would cover. Attendance matters so I would not recommend if you skip class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTA3NDEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4820","date_posted":"2024-11-22 21:11:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was great for her first semester at KSU! Lots of powerpoint lectures, and she goes rather fast, so I would wish there was more time taken to focus on the lecture portions. One semester long project, three tests, participation and attendance mandatory. She is great, kindhearted, and caring nonetheless.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDE2NDI2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
