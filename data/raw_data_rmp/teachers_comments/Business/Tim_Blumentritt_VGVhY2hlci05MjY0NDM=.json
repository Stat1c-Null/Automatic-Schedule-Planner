Terrific lectures, and he does a good job of reviewing previously discussed material before each new lecture. And he doesn't just read from a PPT, which is so refreshing. Your grade is based on application quizzes and case study papers. Due diligence in reading, researching, and writing is vital to do well in this class.

This is a real critical thinking class that translates well into the corporate world. The text quizzes are easy, right from the book; focus most attention on the written assignments - those are more intense (& where the tediousness comes in). You get used to his structure.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Njg3NDg0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Graded by few things--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2024-07-01 02:08:55 +0000 UTC","comment":" Professor Blumentritt always gives good general feedback on the application quizzes and provides examples so you know how to improve for next time.

It is mostly based on participation and how well you can implement the information you learn in class to discussions and case studies. If you attend class you will be more than fine. I definitely recommend taking him as his discussions are fun and informative.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MTEyODY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2023-08-08 14:04:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Summer Semester:\n2 Quizzes/week\n1 500 word paper/week\n2 2000 word papers\n\nTook this class as a capstone for the Bachelor's program.

All the assignments are due at the end of the semester, so you won't know exactly how well you're doing until the end, though we did take the final exam a month before the semester ended.

Dr. Blumentritt cares about the subject and about the students. However, he grades very tough and gives very few A's. He is still much better than most of the other professors that teach this course as he actually cares whereas not all professors do. Be prepared to study hard and take really good notes.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzI0NjM1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT8910","date_posted":"2009-05-27 07:36:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Likes to talk about his thoughts on everything.

Hard class.  Confusing at first, especially Capsim, but then it's a blast - especially if your team does well.  He's not an easy grader, and should not be. But as this is a mandatory class in the MBA program, he's a good bet for this class.  Do the work and you'll be OK.
