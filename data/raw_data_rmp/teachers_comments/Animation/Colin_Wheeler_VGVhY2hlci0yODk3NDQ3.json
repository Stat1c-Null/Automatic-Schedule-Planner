It was one of those long friday classes and it felt like forever but as long as you like drawing, storyboarding, and making animatics it's a fun class! For the last project you have complete creative control and it's great. Professor Wheeler is also pretty lenient and helpful as well","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTM5NzQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARH-3830","date_posted":"2025-01-06 03:45:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was a great lecturer and you could tell he was passionate about what he was teaching. However, his quizzes and tests were extremely difficult. All of the slideshows had 40+ slides and we would be quizzed on 4-5 slideshows at a time. A quiz/test question would be based off one bulletpoint on a random slide. Otherwise a very interesting class.

He's very knowledgeable and makes thing easy to understand for non-animation majors. Tests were a little hard, but I have a hard time memorizing names/dates. Overall a good experience!

Project heavy with two that require you to spend a substantial amount of time on an artwork for a non-studio class. Make sure to study for the tests and quizzes as there are usually no study guides!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTY3Njg4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARH-3830","date_posted":"2024-10-17 22:19:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr.Wheeler is great! Very funny, has great lectures. You can tell he puts a lot of effort into having clear and concise lectures. There is no discussion posts or weekly homework, but he does have in class quiz/exam and some projects. No study guides, you only have his powerpoints. Make sure you study and take good notes. Start your projects EARLY!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODI1NDE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Hilarious--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
