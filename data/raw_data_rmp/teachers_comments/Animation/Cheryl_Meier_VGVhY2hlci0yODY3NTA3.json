I think the course was very informational, building up basics before a full on character design, however prepare for a lot of due dates. If you communicate with her, she is very kind and flexible.

As long as you read the project requirements and work to fulfill them, you'll probably get an A. She also gives a TON of extra credit opportunities, so you could probably get over a 100 if you put in extra work!
