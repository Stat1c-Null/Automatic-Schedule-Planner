Her lectures are heavy with 100+ slides, but everything on the exams are based on the ppts which is why they are soooo much. Exams are MC, T/F, and SATA. Attendance is mandatory for points, but you can miss up to 3 days without penalty. DO THE QUESTIONS OF THE DAY & CASE STUDIES, this will guarantee an A!

This is supposed to be one of the harder nursing classes, but almost everyone got at least a B. There are a lot of extra points outside of tests, and if you come to class and read the PowerPoint, you'll be fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODc0NzMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3304","date_posted":"2024-01-06 03:44:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I don't recommend this professor! Patho is a very hard class and she just makes it harder. She is a really nice lady but she's not good at making sure everyone understands. Almost every powerpoint is 100 + slides weekly, while the other patho class (steppe class) only has 70-80 slides. She puts way too many things on her slides that is not needed.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODM4NzU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
