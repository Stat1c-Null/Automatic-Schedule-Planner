Attendance is mandatory otherwise you will receive a zero. She is an amazing professor, and you can tell she loves her job. For anyone who is looking for a class to learn in but also stress free, if you already have a heavy workload, I recommend her!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzg2MDE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IPE4413","date_posted":"2024-12-12 13:40:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"It is annoying how tough of a grader she is, considering the theoretical nature of this class. You are also only graded on a handful of assignments, which makes the other assignments feel redundant. The entire class is based off group collaboration, so there are not many opportunities for personal application assignments/practicums.

All the assignments are group ones and you dont get to pick your teammates. Attendance is mandatory and your grade will be affected if you dont attend. Shes an extremely hard grader which is really annoying bc the class is about concepts and communication.

Groupwork throughout the semester, including homework and projects. There is a textbook, but I honestly didn't use it at all. Attendance is mandatory. I didn't like how only 4 of the homework assignments were graded, and we didn't have enough time in class to work on them.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTI3NDk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"nursing","date_posted":"2024-10-17 19:11:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"IPE4413. Participation is key. Group work a ton. Tough grader, make sure you use rubric to complete assignments and ask for clarity because she will take points off. Very nice professor, very knowledgeable. There is a group assignment every week. Not a hard class attendance is key.
