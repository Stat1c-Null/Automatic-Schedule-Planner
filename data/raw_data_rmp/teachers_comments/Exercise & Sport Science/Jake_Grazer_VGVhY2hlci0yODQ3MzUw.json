His lectures and slides were pretty good, but there wasn't really a clear rubric for the projects he gave out. His Jeopardy reviews and extra credit saved me from getting a C in the class.

Along with this, 50% of the course workload was given in the LAST WEEK!!! TEST 3, FINAL PROJECT, and CUMULATIVE FINAL! Course info on D2L is also given scattered an unorganized throughout the semester, and no students felt well prepared for the final project.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODg3NjU4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES3900","date_posted":"2023-03-14 16:01:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is a hard class but Dr. Grazer makes it easy. He is able to explain everything in great detail making everything understandable and helps connect the difficult concepts. If you aren't in class and paying attention you will not do well. But if you show up and listen to his lectures, the class is easy.

He receives feedback very well from students about tests, quizzes, and homework. Some students were not a fan of professor Grazer and I get it but ex phys is an upper division class and it is not an easy subject so you NEED to put in work to earn a high grade.

Ex Phys is hard but he tries to make it as easy as possible. He explains all the concepts very well and in a way that they are easier to understand. He also values students' feedback and will provide you with opportunities to help your grade. He truly cares about his students and is more than willing to help you.
