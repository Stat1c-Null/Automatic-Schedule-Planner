That aside, I would have gotten an A if I knew to only study the weekly assignments for exams at the start of the semester. If you do that then you're guaranteed to pass all the exams. Overall, he was fine though.

Professor Conrad tries to be relatable as a KSU grad but is overly harsh. The work felt like busy work, and the few major assignments were graded unfairly.
