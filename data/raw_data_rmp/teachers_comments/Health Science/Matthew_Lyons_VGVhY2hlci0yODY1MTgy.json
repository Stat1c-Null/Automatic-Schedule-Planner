You have 3 free absences, but after that, it starts affecting your grade. He does a lot of group work and these presentations every Thursday, where you have to find an article and explain it to the class. An easy class if you just put in some effort.

He makes the lectures engaging and is lenient on both the lecture structure and assignments/due dates. I wish there were a tad less in-class group assignments, but overall, an amazing professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDM4NTY2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IHS3010","date_posted":"2024-12-11 19:55:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy class! 50% of your grade is on presentation and attendance, as long as you email him an excuse to why you cant make it to class your fine.
