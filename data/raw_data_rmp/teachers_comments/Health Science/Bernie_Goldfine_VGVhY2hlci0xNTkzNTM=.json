If you put in the time to turn assignments in on time, he will reward you. Nothing about this class is too challenging as he wants you to succeed and be a successful coach.

When I found out we were going to ride actual bikes it kind of freaked me out, but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. Would highly recommend an HPE class with him.

However, his teaching skills are not the best. His lectures go off track a lot and trust me, his exams are no joke. He does not teach much of what is on the exam. All I can say is read your textbook and STUDY the textbook. Also pay attention to the videos he plays in class. His exams are unexpectedly hard.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMjkzMTM0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2017-08-10 13:47:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"The focus of this class is to encourage you to make healthy living adaptions.
