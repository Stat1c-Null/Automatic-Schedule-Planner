Projects and discussions were a bit difficult to understand but you get the gist of it eventually. If you are trying to learn actual insurance code, she won't teach you. But if you want a free summer A, shes pretty good.

Doesn't reply to emails but if she does, you're even more confused. Overall, the class was easy but the major projects were very unclear and no one really knew what to do. Good class if you dont really care much and just want to wing it. Bad class if you want to learn and want to have a good grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTkzMTY0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHE3330","date_posted":"2024-05-06 22:53:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Judith was an average professor. Most of the time her assignments were unclear on what she wanted but once you figured it out it was pretty simple. There are lots of quizzes so make sure to do good on those (no lockdown). She also replies to emails very slowly and when she does respond her feedback is not clear.

She had a schedule made with every due date on it and specifically told us to follow the schedule. Well she got her dates wrong and I ended up missing a test because of it. She barely responds to emails and isn't quite sure whats going on with which class because she teaches so many.
