He provides walkthroughs for projects that clearly outline expectations for each project and is accessible outside of class if you need help or extensions. It is asynchronous but I love the way he teaches/ lays things out for students. Wish I was able to be taught by him in person.

While I did not personally reach out to him, he made an open space for students to come to him when need be. He was a great professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjg5MDMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Art4037","date_posted":"2024-07-18 15:54:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took concept art 2 with him and he's ok I guess. Accessible via email usually but has yet to put in a any grade for the 3 projects we've done. Discussions are how you upload your final projects except he doesn't provide any feedback and my peers just pick the same few people to respond to so you might not receive any feedback for any project...","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjMwNzYw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3640","date_posted":"2022-12-19 06:06:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"PLEASE take him if you get the chance!! My favorite professor ever! If you put in the effort you will definitely get an A. He has a good mix of work and fun, and gives lots of good real world advice about the industry. I highly recommend talking to him before/after class too, just to hang out! He always gives great feedback too!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTg1NzQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3600","date_posted":"2022-10-08 05:11:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"100% the best Professor I have ever had, he makes it so easy to learn. He gives good feedback during critique and takes the time to go through anything you need help with. His class is always entertaining and the assignment deadlines/requirements are reasonable. He gives room for exploration and creativity and good industry resources.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Njg1OTc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
