We had weekly homework and an exam review before each test. If you could complete the review on your own, you would do well on the test. He offers 3 bonus points for missing 3 or fewer classes, so if your final class grade is an 87 after the exam, it could become a 90.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDgyMzg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
