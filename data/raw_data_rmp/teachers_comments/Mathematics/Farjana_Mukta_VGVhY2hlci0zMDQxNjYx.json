I liked her class and she made sure to check if anyone had questions while she was going over content. I would recommend sitting in the front because you can ask questions when confused and she isn't weird about answering. No notecard for tests but if you study and do Aleks they're not too bad.

If you take the time to understand. But, she rushes through the material and doesn't use review time for test. 4 tests and they are completely different then what you are learning nor does she look at emails. Let's not forget a 3x5 flash card for a 14 question test with 20 topics on one test.

She's one of the better math teachers there are. Go to class pay attention and ask her questions, she's more than willing to help you understand.

She not only has a thick accent but also rushes through material. We were supposed to have a student assistant in our class but they quit from being overwhelmed by people who needed help. There is also only 3 test in this whole class so if you are not a good test taker good luck. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER.

If you are proficient at Math, her class wouldn't be difficult for you because you already understand basic concepts. People are too scared to ask questions and that is their down fall.

She is a very nice person but not a good professor. If you struggle with math avoid taking this class. She speeds through multiple topics before a test and gives you work through aleks.
