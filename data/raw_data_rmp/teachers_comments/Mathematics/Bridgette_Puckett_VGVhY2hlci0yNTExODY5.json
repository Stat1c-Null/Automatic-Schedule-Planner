Truly wants you to succeed. I had her summer semester during the COVID pandemic and the course was taught through ALEKS. She was accessible and eager to help. Only negative was that she either takes 5 minutes or 5 days to answer emails. Exams are graded through ALEKS, but she'll go back through and give partial credit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTIwNjE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1160","date_posted":"2020-05-11 19:59:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is one of the best professors at Kennesaw State University.
