Pretty much weekly homework for 30% of grade. 2 exams each worth 20% and Final is worth 30%. Gives a quiz over the lecture. If you can complete all of them unassisted, I would say you have an extremely high chance of acing the exam. They are very similar. He is extremely extremely smart too. It's a straightforward class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTg1MzIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He's a great teacher but doesn't do enough practice problems imo. His tests tho are of the hardest topics possible, he also is a very tough grader and isn't quick to give out points after talking about the grade received. However he is much better than my previous Calc 1 teacher.

Math is hard but this guy knows so much! Every other math teacher I have ever had never explained anything. He is a young nerdy professor who clearly loves math.
