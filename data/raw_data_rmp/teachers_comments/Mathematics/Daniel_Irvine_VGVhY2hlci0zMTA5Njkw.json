Irvine is very kind and is accessible during office hours to answer any questions. He uses textbooks and loves cats. He occasionally does a little cat/meow song number so be sure to always attend class, tho he's flexible with attendance.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNDY3NDg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2202","date_posted":"2025-06-28 00:42:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dan the man helped make a class that could've sucked, bearable and one I would take again. He's always willing to help, especially during office hours! If you lock in and go to office hours, he will definitely back you up and help you succeed. \n\nP.s. He does give group work so be ready to be a little social.
