He is extremely fair and you know what to expect from him.  Has 4 exams and a final with the lowest out of the 4 dropped and the final replaces the new low test grade.  Simply put he is the kind of teacher that will make you work, but will reward you if you do.  He concentrates on fundamentals than the complex difficult probs","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDY5OTQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2009-06-17 00:21:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor. He is the most clear math teacher I have ever encountered. Three test grades and a final; tests are straight from homework & examples done in class. He tells you the layout of each test in advance.
