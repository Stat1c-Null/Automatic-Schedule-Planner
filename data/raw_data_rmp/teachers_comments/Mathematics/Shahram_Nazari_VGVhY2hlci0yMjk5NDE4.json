There's a ton of material to cover, and this professor covers all of it very thoroughly; be ready to pay a lot of attention. The material isn't necessarily difficult, and if you do find yourself stuck ask questions. He is very kind, and can provide you many examples until you understand.

The notes from class did not match the mathlab homework at all. Smart center taught me easier ways to do the units he taught the most complicated way.
