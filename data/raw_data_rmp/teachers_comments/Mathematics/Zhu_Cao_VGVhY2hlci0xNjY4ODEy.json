I think he is a great teacher. He's very nice and helpful. If you have trouble understanding something, he doesn't have a problem spending some extra time helping you grasp the concept.

Do not take if you learn in lecture because he will leave you behind.  Be ready to teach yourself.

He was willing to help but his help was also hard to understand. I know some of the students who were good at math did well, but I came in without prior calculus classes and it was difficult for me.

He helps out so much that you wouldn't think he would be allowed to say certain things during a test. I'm used to asian accents so it didn't bother me but he does have a really heavy accent.
