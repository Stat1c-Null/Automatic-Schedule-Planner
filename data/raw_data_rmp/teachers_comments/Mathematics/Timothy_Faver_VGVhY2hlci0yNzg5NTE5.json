His lectures are theory-heavy but good and help you understand everything deeply. Weekly problem sets and quizzes, plus three exams total (with final). Out of the 12 quizzes, your 3 lowest scores get dropped. Just make sure you're locked in during class, do the homework, and you should be ok","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjM3MDg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH-3260","date_posted":"2025-02-13 20:42:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly the worst professor out there his teaching style is abysmal and his lectures are more about writing down fast enough before he erases it off the board than actually learning. He acts extremely pretentiously and it feels like he does not care for his student nor for their well being.

You'll suffer from tedious HWs (textbook and daily log, from website, 35%) without lots of studying and reading from both. Avoid if this is not your cup of tea.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODU1NjYy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH-2306","date_posted":"2022-12-15 18:09:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"I adored Dr.Faver's class. He was the best professor I have ever taken in my 3 years in college. His feedback is so thought-out and he genuinely wants each student to feel comfortable succeeding. There is no question he will not take the time to answer and do so thoroughly. I can not recommend him enough and hope to have him again in the future!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTM4Nzc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH-2306","date_posted":"2022-12-15 14:07:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Faver was the best math teacher that I've had at KSU. He does do 2 projects, but he's an easy grader with them. If you make an effort for your grade, he acknowledges that, and will be easier on you. If you're struggling go to his office during hours! I promise it helps more than you know. Dr. Faver as a person is just as amazing.

The only time in my life where I learned so much in the class that I barely had to study for the final. He makes classes very enjoyable and engaging.
