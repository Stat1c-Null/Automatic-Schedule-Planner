ASK QUESTIONS and go to office hours! It's the difference between passing and failing. Weekly quizzes and four exams. Group projects include teaching the class sections out of the textbook. He's not the worst professor I've ever had but the class could've gone better.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTU0OTc4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2021-10-25 15:40:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this math class on marietta campus as a biology major. My last math class needed and it is way different than I had pictured. He doesn't slow or down or explain things well at all.

I took him during his 2nd semester teaching and it seems like he really improved from the first semester. I enjoyed his class and he was super lenient and understanding about stuff. I would recommend him for sure. He does not deserve the rating he has right now.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njk1MDIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2335","date_posted":"2021-01-12 02:20:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tests were bad, not enough time for the amount of questions given. He thought he fixed it, he didn't. Does not accept criticism well. Can't teach to save his life. I would definitely avoid him. This was his first semester teaching, I hate being a guinea pig.

The class was more here is the hw and if you have any questions, ask in the virtual class. When asked to change teaching style, was unwilling.
