You can do well in the class with only the notes and practice online. Open to questions and doesn't judge. Allows notecards and cheat sheets on every test. Quizzes have strange due dates so pay attention. Decent amount of ALEKS homework (tedious).","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTkwOTI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2025-05-03 03:58:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Stats professor.

Love her lectures. She does move fast but was very open to questions. We always finished our 1.25 hr class in at most 45 min. She allows notecards on all exams and quizzes.Finished notes and lecture videos are posted. Only problem was that quizzes were due at really sporadic times, so i missed a couple. but she drops lowest quiz.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTkxOTgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2024-11-22 03:41:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"was able to exempt my final exam even though i am not great at math. her lectures are easy to understand and she posts completed notes. homework is on ALEKS and quizzes are at home with three in person exams. if you put forth the effort, this is an amazing stats class to take. very friendly and opened up all quizzes at the end if you missed one.

I would only take this professor if you already have a comfortable understanding of stats, there is not a lot of built-in support otherwise. Seems young and inexperienced, has room to grow her approach.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzgwODgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
