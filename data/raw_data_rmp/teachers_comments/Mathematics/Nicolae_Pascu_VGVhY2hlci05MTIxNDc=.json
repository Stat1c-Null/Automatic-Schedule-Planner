Do the work, you'll get an A+.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NjExNTQy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH003","date_posted":"2009-03-08 21:05:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome teacher very caring very sweet fairly easy","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTE1Njk0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CALC2253","date_posted":"2008-08-19 20:15:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very great teacher.
