He gives review sheets before each test which are very helpful - I found that if I did the review sheets, the tests were pretty easy to do well on.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjczMzY=","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PROBSTATI","date_posted":"2004-12-07 18:42:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"He has an accent, but you get used to it pretty quickly.  Lectures are very clear and provides review sheets that are fairly similar to tests.  Goes above and beyond when it comes to making time for extra help and office hours.
