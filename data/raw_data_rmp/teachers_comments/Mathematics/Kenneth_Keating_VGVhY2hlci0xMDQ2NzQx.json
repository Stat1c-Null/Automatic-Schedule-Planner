He has a roundabout way of doing things. Sometimes he tries to be funny and no one laughs, but he is friendly. Don't ask for extensions, he gets really angry. Tests are a bit frustrating but passable. Homework is easy. He is an okay teacher.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzIwODk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2009-04-16 00:32:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this professor after being out of school for over 15 years and he was very helpful and made sure the students understood the math problems.

He has a very real understanding of the subject matter.  Seemed to get a touch frustrated a few times, but it was from questions that were a little elementary.  He has a great attitude that produces a positive learning envirnment. A calculator is not mandatory, but it helps.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0Njk0ODYz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2008-07-09 08:53:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"I'm not someone who is naturally good at Math so a good teacher is important.

Teaches in a way that nobody can understand or follow. Gives out many quizzes and tests. Generous grading, not helpful outside class.
