I would not have passed Algebra without her. If you care about her class she will help you! Utilize her office hours and put in the effort. She is a very kind and caring teacher and cares about how you do inside of school and outside of school.

I loved her class. She is clear and concise in her instructions and answers emails really fast. Plus she gives such good feedback on homework and discussions.

Only thing is there is a lot of homework and she doesnt let you make up missed assignments, and she can be a bit slow going through material.
