She may not be the most pleasant, but it is an easy A. I recieved a very high A in her class and did little work. Only one section was hard. She isn't always helpful but the class was easy.

She is literally the worst professors I've ever had. Unhelpful, unfair, and clearly does not care for her students to pass. Attendance is mandatory, she deducts points from your grades for every absence-- excused or unexcused. Treats you like a high school student. Waste of your time.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDA0MjU5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TRIG666","date_posted":"2012-12-03 03:34:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is no help...she writes the problem on the board then erases it....she even sometimes gets the problem wrong and asks her teachers aid to help her.....i dont think she can do TRIG without the teachers notes.....BAD TEACHER","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTM0ODE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2011-06-20 12:40:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the worst professor I have ever had!
