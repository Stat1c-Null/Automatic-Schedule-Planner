She will answer any questions, no matter how rudimentary, without making you feel dumb. She offers plenty of office hours and is very helpful with any hw or math questions that you may have. Tests are easy if you do the hw and show up to class for the quizzes.

This can be really nice, but sometimes she is way too hyped. She doesn't like being late to her class, and doesn't take hw if you are late.

In fact my favorite teacher I've had so far at SPSU.  She explains calculus very well, and is extremely helpful.  She wants you to learn.

Very limited calculator use on exams. Grade consist of three highest exam grades and a final. Homework counts as up to 10 extra credit points on each test.
