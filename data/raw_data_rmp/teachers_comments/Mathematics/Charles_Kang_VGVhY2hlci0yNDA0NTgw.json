He covers all the material in lecture, takes notes on his PowerPoint, and saves PowerPoint out there with the notes for the students. That allows the student to plan accordingly.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzAwNTU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CAL2","date_posted":"2018-11-08 22:55:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Taking with him cal2 this sem. It was a bit hard. The first two exams were not hard. He saw the class average and made it outta of 90 lol. Tests are straightforward from the slides. No need to take notes, he posted slides for each chapter. the attendance is not mandatory but every end of the class, there're small quizzes( often in groups)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjkwODkz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2018-10-16 06:25:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"His class is absolutely tough but he's very transparent about what will be on the test and all the material is well taught. Attendance isn't mandatory but he goes through one section per class so missing a class can be devastating. He has a quirky and entertaining sense of humor and is a joy to talk to. Definitely take the time to get to know him.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTczNTA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--TEST HEAVY--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2203","date_posted":"2018-09-20 23:10:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Classes for calc 3 Run for almost 2 hours twice a week, so missing one class can put you very behind. The class is also rather difficult to grasp in and of itself, but his lectures are very concise and his sense of humor is quirky, unique and entertaining. Im hoping to take him again for Diff Eq next semester, but his class will require effort.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTE0MDMz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
