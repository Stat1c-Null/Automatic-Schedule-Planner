Tests are online through teams and can be difficult but are not too complicated. She can be a harsh grader but is pretty fair.

Make sure to do well on the homework and quizzes as tests make up most of your grade. Make sure to cover everything in the lectures as it might show up on the tests. The class is not easy so you need to study in advance. However, there are practise exams that will do a decent amount of catch up.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDgxNTcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3260","date_posted":"2024-08-10 04:45:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Asma is amazing! She posts her lecture notes online after class, but she goes over it well in class too. HW helps to supplement learning. Quizzes and tests are predictable. She provides a lot of extra credit and is very kind and approachable. Low key funny too, you have to pay attention but she cracks some funny jokes in class.

She is super lazy and does the bare minimum. SHE STOPS THE EXAMPLES HALFWAY BECAUSE SHE'S TIRED!

It was her 1st time teaching Num Met and imo Num Met is an annoying class to take, but she did a great job at breaking down concepts slowly and some nice examples.
