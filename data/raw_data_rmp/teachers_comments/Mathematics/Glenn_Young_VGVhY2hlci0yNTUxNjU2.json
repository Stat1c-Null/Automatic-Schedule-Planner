Three exams and a final, covering vocab/theorems, true/false questions, and proofs straight from the homework. Exams are weighted progressively (lowest 10%, next 15%, then 20%, highest 25%). Weekly homework sets. The proofs you practice there are the exam proofs. Go to class and do the homework.

His course follows the textbook (which can be found online) and it makes a lot of sense. He has weekly quizzes on Wednesdays that are based on the homework that was due the Friday before. His tests are based off homework and quizzes. LEARN YOUR VOCAB.

His grading is relatively fair, his study guides are nearly irrelevant to any quiz/exam. All his examinations are semi-reflective of his homework and previous quizzes.

He wants you to succeed, and if you give effort to that, show up for his office and ask questions you will. He is kind, smart, and good at lecturing.
