Lots of things to be graded on so don't sweat. Well structured paper which takes the whole semester, however the assignments help you slowly build towards it so completing it is a breeze and unstressful.

She is easily accessible to reach via email on any questions regarding the course work. We have Inquizitive HW's, Chapter quizzes, Tests, and a Research Paper. All were easy besides the test (though I should've done more studying on my part). Besides that, she is a great professor to take for Research in Psych.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjI4MjA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2500","date_posted":"2024-12-02 04:15:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Cease is an outstanding professor! She is kind, understanding, and provides detailed feedback that helps you learn and improve. Her explanations make complex topics easy to grasp, and she creates an inclusive, supportive environment.

Textbook is free, 13 chapters, 12 quizzes, 3 major exams, one essay but it's written over the whole class, so it's not stressful. Great feedback, lenient grader, clear instructions.

While you do have to read the textbook chapter a week in advance to take the quiz, you will still learn something from her lectures. She is a lenient grader and is super nice. There is some work to do, but just read the textbook, show up, and do the work. I reccomend asking her opinion on your papers in advance!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTU5ODU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2500","date_posted":"2024-10-31 13:45:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr.Cease is a fair grader, most of the assignments are for participation and weekly inquizitive activities. To get an A; read the textbook, study, & come to class. This class is not made to be hard but was made so that we could genuinely learn the material, not just get a good grade. I loved her and hope to see her again in the future at KSU.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODc2Mzkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
