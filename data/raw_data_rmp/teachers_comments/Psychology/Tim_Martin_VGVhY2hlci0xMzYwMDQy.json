He was out the first month of class then never seemed to care about class. He didn't even look at the book we were assigned so our reading assignments hardly went along with the book.

He is very helpful and listens to his students. This is a tough class but I do recommend taking him because he will HELP you through it! 4 exams and he drops the lowest. a lot of homework but very helpful with your grade if you do it right.

The class was very hard, because there was A LOT of reading involved. Tests are easy, as they come directly from the study guide. He is EXTREMELY helpful and is ALWAYS available.
