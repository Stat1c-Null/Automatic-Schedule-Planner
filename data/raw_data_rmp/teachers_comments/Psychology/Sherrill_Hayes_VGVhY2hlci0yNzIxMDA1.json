I had him Spring 2022 and am trying to figure out how to take him again. Amazing lecture, easy class, but you actually learn. He made me fall in love with human development and this is typically one of the more difficult courses. If you have any opportunity to take this professor, do it.

He truly cares about your success in the course and gives you every opportunity to exceed and get a great grade. His lectures are great, he's relatable, stays on topic, facilitates conversations among students. Take any class if he is the prof!

Dr.Hayes from day one has always showed that he cares about his students. He gives great feedback when needed, and his lectures are very informative. Quizzes and reflections were simple, you just need to read! Would definitely take a class by Dr.Hayes again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjEzMDg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2103","date_posted":"2022-01-12 19:22:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hayes impressed me with his knowledge in and out of psychology. I could tell the semester would be full of really great, interesting information and it was. He encourages you to talk in class and I do too, because it really adds to the lecture, and its interesting hearing what everyone has to say.
