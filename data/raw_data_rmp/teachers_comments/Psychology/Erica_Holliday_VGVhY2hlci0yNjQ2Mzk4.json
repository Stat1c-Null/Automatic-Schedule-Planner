The assignments were random and had nothing to do with the lectures, and the lectures were hard to follow. I sent emails to her through the semester with no response, and she is a super slow grader. There were 2 exams, weekly quizzes, and either a paper or research proposal.

Her class was very easy and stress free. Her lectures were very interesting and she does great explaining.

Her lectures are very entertaining and she allows the whole class to get involved in the discussion. The course contains no tests, just quizzes, projects, and other smaller activities. She's very understanding of late work and gives multiple opportunities to turn something in.

No exams, just projects that you can basically do whatever you want with. Her lectures are engaging and there are in class assignments that really help you understand everything.

She turns what could be an extremely difficult class into a fun educational experience. I was always excited to attend her lectures. Instead of tests, you complete fun, creative projects and the quizzes are very simple and straight forward. She has been the best professor I've had so far.

She does an in class credit assignment every week and her tests aren't actually tests, they're like create your own knowledge projects with the key terms from the chapters we learn in class.

The course material is interesting, which is a plus. I love that she doesn't just focus on her course material. She does wellness checks with her students. She is incredibly understanding.

She makes lectures interesting. I recommend attending just due to the fact that the content is not easy. 3 exams. A few quizzes. A few discussions.

Shes new at KSU (Fall 2020) and absolutely amazing. I recommend taking her if possible. She facilitated great conversation and is the first professor I would actually want to go out to hang with.

I mean, not me... but, yeah... shes cool.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTMwMzAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
