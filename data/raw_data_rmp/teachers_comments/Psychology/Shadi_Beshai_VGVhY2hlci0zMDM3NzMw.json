He had PLENTY of study tools being short lecture videos, PowerPoint notes, kahoots and study guides to use to review. He did have quizzes and exams on webcam, but was willing to let you retake it if necessary. Most else was a essay project.

His lectures were a bit hard to follow along with because they're just not engaging at all but the workload isn't bad, he's very lenient when helping you, and gives good grade bump opportunities. I liked how all the things we did in class tied into our final project. Boring lectures, but he cares about you.

He's very knowledgable. Caring and goes out of his way to make sure you do well. Exams are hard, but assignments and papers were fair. If you put in effort you'll probably get a good grade.

His lectures are also pretty boring so they're hard to follow along with. This may just be because theres not enough information to fill the class. You have bonus points for attendance but with how touchy his grading is it's worth it to go imo. He is super willing to help you though and help you improve","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODQ0MTk1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
