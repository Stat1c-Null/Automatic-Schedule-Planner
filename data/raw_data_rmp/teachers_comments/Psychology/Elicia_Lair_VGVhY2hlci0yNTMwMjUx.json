The assignments are spread out and you can use notes on test and quizzes. There are 3 test and 8 or 9 quizzes I believe all using a lockdown browser. There's also discussions and Sona that you have to participate in but it's super easy. Kinda easy class with LOTS OF READING AND NOTES!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzg5MTg2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PSYC3325","date_posted":"2019-11-05 19:45:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is Professor Lair's first semester at KSU. I currently am taking her social psychology course and enjoy every minute of it! She is very clear about her expectations. In my opinion, the weekly quizzes are more difficult than her tests. But when I say the only downside of her course is mandatory attendance, I mean it. Not too much work!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzYyMTMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2500","date_posted":"2019-10-30 20:36:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is awesome!!
