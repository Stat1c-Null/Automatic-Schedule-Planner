He was a reasonable professor and reached out a good but. I would honestly take another class with him. The course itself is a lot to take in and is a bit challenging  but the professor does have over 15 extra credit oppurtunities","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzMyNzk1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2025-04-21 21:53:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hilley was a great professor. He was super understanding when I missed an assignment and allowed me to make it up. His expectations are very clear and although this course was difficult for me, Dr. Hilley made it very manageable. As long as you just try, you will be completely fine! He is caring and responsive. Definitely take him if you can!

I would say this online class was not the most difficult, however it is important that you stay on top of your homework and keep up with due dates. He is also somewhat understanding if you cannot get an assignment done and need to make it up, but will take off late points.

His lectures arent good and the tests aren't off the textbook or the lectures. failed 1st one with 60. Probably going to drop the class because of the amount of stress. 15 weekly assignments, got an email I wasn't actively engaged in class when missed one assignment from school.\n","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NzkxMjM3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
