Dr. Gottstein is firm about rules like no extra credit and no late submissions. She is very responsive to emails and might extend a deadline if you give her a good reason. She sometimes hints at test material in class which is helpful.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNDg4MzEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2103","date_posted":"2025-05-13 08:47:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was nice, and responded to emails quickly, however she gives no sort of study guide or clear guidance on what to expect on the tests. Most of the tests covered 4 chapters, which each had several units, so a lot of studying is needed. Tests are lockdown browser, camera on. I would not take another course with this professor personally.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjY0NDQ3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2103","date_posted":"2025-05-08 21:38:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"A hard class but she made it easier in my opinion, her lectures are good summaries of the textbook readings the only thing I was not a huge fan of was the weekly activities on learning curve but I really did enjoy her class and got alot out of it learning wise.

Highly responsive to emails and questions, even on weekends. There is a policy for no late work and no extra credit, but she's willing to discuss this if needed.

I took her for an online class, and it was time-consuming and confusing. The material itself isn't confusing, but she makes the class much harder than it needs to be. She doesn't put clear instructions on the assignment and says it's your fault. She also won't tell you what to study for exams, so you're on your own.
