His lectures are fun and interesting and he has a lot of lore. The class has about 1-2 tests and you do a group project in the end where you apply what you learned. I would take him anytime! He is cool and I've retained a lot in his class! :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTYwNTQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2500","date_posted":"2025-04-28 12:37:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Moore is great. Idk many people that could make a 3 hour class as engaging as he did. research methods is a difficult class, you MUST come to class and take notes or you'll be sorry. There was also a group project, which professor Moore tries to stay pretty hands off with-- which is daunting, but necessary for growth and learning.

His class was 3 hours long and lecture-heavy, however, he made the class go by pretty quickly with his jokes and sarcasm. The way he teaches definitely helps lock the information in your brain. The only thing I struggled with was his lack of feedback on assignments.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3OTc3ODA1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2500","date_posted":"2023-05-17 01:26:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"What a great professor! Humorous, caring, welcoming. Though class was early, he made it worthwhile to attend. Midterm and Final, but he prepares you through his entertaining lectures and participation.

I wish I could've taken more from him! He's amazing and will help you succeed if you want it.  2 easy group presentations, 4 quizzes, final, midterm, paper.

Also, very fair when grading and if you pay attention in class and participate you will do fine. He provides numerous amount of office hours if you are confused.

However, he almost refuses to explain difficult concepts in a way that's easier to understand if you ask. A lot of people in my class would feel dumb when asking because he would basically restate what he already said, which made learning the material difficult.
