He spends a lot of time clarifying the material and making sure the class understands. His second exam was far too long, but I'm sure he'll take that into account and change it. He is very considerate, learns most student names, and he is actually pretty funny. Go to class or you won't survive.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTc5MTEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1101","date_posted":"2015-12-22 20:40:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a super sweet professor who really cares about his students. He wants people to be interactive with him and my class just wouldn't do it. His Psyc1101 is an easy A  however if you actually go to class and listen you will learn alot. He also has an accent, but if you pay attention it wont get in the way of learning.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODA2NDAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1100","date_posted":"2015-12-17 17:16:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Jay was such a great teacher. He is so concerned for his students and truly wants you to succeed. He only had 1 test in my class which was so easy because he actually taught me during class. If you do the assignments and actually study for a second for the test you will make a 100 in this class. I highly recommend taking him if you can!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NzQ3NzQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2300","date_posted":"2015-12-16 10:08:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Jay is a very considerate guy who genuinely cares about his job and his students. Lectures can sometimes seem a bit aimless, but he is a fairly easy grader who gives good feedback on assignments. Ask for help and you'll get it. I was very worried about this class as I am not very good at math, but I received a high A and did learn a lot.

I have been in a group presentation for the entire semester. If you have free time to meet once a week with a group, then go for this class. He is not clear on his instructions and does not know what he wants. There are no tests, which are great, but you have to deal with a group project for like ever.

He can be a little confusing as to how you will be assessed/ what he is looking for but will clarify if asked and is a VERY generous grader.
