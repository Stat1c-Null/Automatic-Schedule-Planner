You only write one paper all semester and spend the entire semester doing research and different parts for that paper. She is a bit of a slow grader but honestly, the class was not difficult. Just put in your effort and you will be fine. She does have attendance questions every week but it's a \"yes or \"no\" thing","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTUwODAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2025-04-21 16:03:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love this professor, she's so sweet and caring, and she's very lenient with everything. A lot of writing assignments but she's an easy grader which makes it easier to do them. She is very harsh with participation, and she expects everyone to participate in everything. Would definitely take her again though. Two major final projects.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTkxMjgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2025-03-11 14:22:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Hill's  English 1101 course was amazing. As a professor she helped students out in a way that  would help them excel in the class and was very clear and had great lectures. There was never a moment where assignments or directions were unclear. Overall great class, professor, and environment!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzU3Mzcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2025-01-14 20:16:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"The best professor ever. She is SO sweet and caring! Not to mention hilarious. I took her for 1101 & 1102 English my freshman year and aced both classes. Her assignments are well thought out and spaced well enough to give you more than enough time to complete. She even wrote me a recommendation letter for me for a scholarship I won.

She ensured that everybody always knew what they were doing and had us do peer reviews to ensure that. She also loves to make her students laugh and participate. Her courses are more on the writing side but she is 105% worth taking. If you want to pass English TAKE HER.
