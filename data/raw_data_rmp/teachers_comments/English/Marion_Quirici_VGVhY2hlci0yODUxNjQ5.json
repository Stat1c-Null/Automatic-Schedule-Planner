The class involves group work, peer review, tech-heavy assignments, and chances for revisions. If you're interested in diverse communities, especially disability, you'll learn a lot. If you attend class, do the readings, and keep up, you will succeed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjg5MTUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-4490","date_posted":"2025-05-08 22:04:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Q's Accessible Writing class (special topic ENGL 4490) brought my skills up to a whole new level. Fascinating assignments (though lots of work)! Many of the assignments, such as a cover letter and a portfolio, will be helpful when job hunting. She is very encouraging, flexible. and approachable. The course material was very well organized.

The majority of assignments were discussion boards in the \"keyword - quote - question\" format in order to guide the discussion and our thinking.

Instead of plain paragraphs, discussion is used to talk about course texts. A lot of creativity is allowed for your big assignments.
