Gives great feedback and is available to review your essays before they are due.  She helped my writing skills a lot. Even though I dread the subject of English, her class made the subject seem a little better.  The class is somewhat difficult, but if you get all of your work reviewed it isn't too bad.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTExOTcx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--Skip class?
