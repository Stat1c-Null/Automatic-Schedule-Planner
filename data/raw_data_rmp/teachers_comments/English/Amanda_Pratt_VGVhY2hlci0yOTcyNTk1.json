Dr. Pratt generally replies fast to emails. Grading system (&#8220;ungrading&#8221;) was odd for me. Average workload, but there is a lot of group work. Group conference is required, but it was hard to plan around group members' schedules.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTE0NDc2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2024-09-04 19:18:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not a good grader she doesn't grade fairly and accuse multiple students of using AI with no proof no AI report no nothing just her intuition she ask to do word doc showing that you did the paper without AI then decided she didn't like it WOULD NOT  RECOMMEND HER AT ALL ","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NzI0MDg3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2024-08-29 15:59:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"this is the worse class i ever took while attending this university.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NzE0MzAy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2023-12-27 06:31:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing.

She is incredibly lenient on due dates as long as you communicate and don't abuse it and her grading system is awesome. She is super understanding and made the class really fun.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzYxMDEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
