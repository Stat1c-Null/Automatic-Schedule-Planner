He exceeded all expectations. When ever I had a question about an assignment, he would answer within a day or so. He is also more than willing to work with you as long as you give a decent amount of effort in the class.

Don't be afraid to disagree with him. You want to be sure he knows your name, so talk to him before/after class and snag a seat up front. Stop in during his office hours (he is into mentoring) if you have a question about a paper. Lastly, you get to redo 1 paper-so take advantage of that.
