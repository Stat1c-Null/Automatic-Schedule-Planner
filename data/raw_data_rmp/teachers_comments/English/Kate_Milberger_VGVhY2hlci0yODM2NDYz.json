Has 3 major assignments, lots of discussion posts. She gives amazing feedback on essays and has very clear grading criteria. Not too difficult if you're good at writing. Essays are based on arguments and page requirements are long, usually 4-6 pages per assignment. Overall, great class and great instructor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODMyMjg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2025-01-14 19:46:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Was a really easy class and interesting ","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTQ3Njk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2025-01-07 04:48:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet and responds to emails fast.
