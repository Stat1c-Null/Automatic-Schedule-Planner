Then I had submitted another essay that was pretty much the exact same quality  and he didn't receive it very well, and failed it claiming it wasn't what he wanted. I think it was because it didn't morally align with him because he's painfully woke. Boring class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNDY0NTUx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-11-23 22:26:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's an amazing professor and is super caring.

He comes to class, tells you what u need to do, and then lets you out early. I was very nervous about the essays since I hate typing papers but I have gotten all A's so far. Very simple class, I would take it again. And he also lets you finish any missing work to get a grade and not take 0's.

You are graded on 4 essay's which he grades pretty fairly and weekly discussion post. You will need the textbooks to complete the post.

He is very monotone which makes the class even more boring but the class is super easy. You have a few papers but no tests. Attendance is mandatory so you need to go in order to get an A.
