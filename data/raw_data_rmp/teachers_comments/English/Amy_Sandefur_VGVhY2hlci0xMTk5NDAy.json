Your grade is based on 4 essays, discussion board posts, and peer review. I think she is a very lenient grader. The actually class is very boring and pointless to go to, but she does take attendance so be there. I would definitely take her!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDAwNDEy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2010-04-14 00:31:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Sandefur: nice person, however class is boring.

She makes the class do retarded exercises sometimes but the easiness of the class is worth it. We wrote 3 papers no more than five pages in length. Most of the class time is spent on the online discussion board on Georgia View.
