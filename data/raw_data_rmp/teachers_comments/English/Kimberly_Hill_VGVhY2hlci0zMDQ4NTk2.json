She's rude whenever she manages to email back. I've had many professors, the worst of all, and I have taken over 30 credits.

Honestly she's really nice and it's an easy A if you do the work. I wouldn't say she grades hardly but she definitely isn't passing out A's but i'd take her again because the class was low stress and assignments were clear.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDkyMTE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"So many papers","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2025-04-29 22:21:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"I wouldn't recommend it typically do very well in english. I i tried reaching out to her for a better grade but she just told me that in the syllabus it says she can ignore them. Do not take her unless you're ready to hear about her talk about her life. Overall she was boring and no help to me whatsoever.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDkxOTc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2025-04-28 14:51:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall she is an okay professor. She has 3 major essays and very few quizzes. She's a bit of a hard grader. She often talks about her personal life during class so it's entertaining/boring at the same time. Don't bother reaching out to her in an email because she will not respond. She is very helpful in class and will give you good feedback.

There are 3 major assignments which are all essays focused around a topic you pick at the beginning of the semester. Overall the class is low stress, and attendance is not required; however, some assignments will be done in class meaning you have to attend to get a grade.
