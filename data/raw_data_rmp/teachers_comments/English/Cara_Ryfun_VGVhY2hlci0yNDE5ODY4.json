She assigned textbook chapters, but they are not necessary to read. For every rough draft we get feedback and it is very helpful. She is a very easy grader. You get graded on attendance. Only 3 essays and a final. No tests or quizzes. She was very kind and open to giving explanations. You can revise your essays for a better grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTQ4NzA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2019-10-22 02:37:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Ryfun made the class easy and manageable. if you have the chance, take her. the class is composed of 3 papers (for me it was a literacy narrative, a rhetorical analysis, and an art analysis) and the final is making one of the papers into a multimedia format. weekly discussion posts and easy textbook readings.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzA1Mzc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2019-10-09 22:07:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor, we had 3 papers you turn in your first draft then she revises it then next week you turn your final in. One project at the end of the year, no tests and the only homework is one 300 word discussion post due Sunday. You only go to class on Monday and Wednesday.

She makes her class easy and enjoyable. My class had no quizzes, tests, or a final. She also goes over what's in the textbook in class on a PPT, so you don't have to buy a textbook.

She really cares about her students and makes a gen ed English class more than bearable. Pretty much dont buy the book, show up, and do your work and you have a high A.

I took English 1101, she told us to buy a book but I saw we were never using it in the first couple weeks so I never bought one.

The class consists of watching a video or reading a book, doing a discussion post and leaving. When we have to write papers, she gives amazing feedback and if you listen to it you will receive a 95-100 on every paper.

Every day in class you will have discussion post but it only has to be 200 words. It is a very low pressure class. She also gives individual feedback on every assignment which makes you feel like you have a more personal connection with her. I would take her again any day.
