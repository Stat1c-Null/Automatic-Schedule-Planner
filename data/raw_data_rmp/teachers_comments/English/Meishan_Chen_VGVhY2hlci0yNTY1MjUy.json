Dr. Chen wasn't really available through email, it would take a couple days for her to respond if she responded at all. I don't think I learned anything useful for the workplace, just different projects we might use...which I highly doubt. Overall she's okay and an easy grader.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTE2NDU1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"So many papers--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LING3045","date_posted":"2024-12-21 12:37:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"We did not receive any grades until after the course was completed, which I disliked.
