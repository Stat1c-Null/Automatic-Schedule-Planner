The workload is moderate for an English class, gives an extra day after deadline to turn things in. However, lectures are boring, and attendance is mandatory as there are assignments every class&#8212;no make-ups even with valid excuse. Be ready to work in pairs or groups a lot, but thankfully, there are no presentations.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTA4OTQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2025-03-17 01:23:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's the best!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzc3ODM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Lots of homework--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2024-11-14 18:50:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"She creates a great space for peer collaboration and grades fairly according to her guidelines. she allows time in class to work on assignments and is very caring and understanding. attendance is encouraged. only 7 discussion posts were required out of 15 modules and even counted an in-class assignment as a discussion post grade. love her!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTUwMjU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2024-10-24 14:24:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"She CARES and is so sweet!! she even takes time out to learn your name. The assignments are easy but if you don't manage your time properly you won't finish in time. She does have in class assignments each class. But everything done in class helps you with future projects, in class assignments are a great grade booster!
