She gives lecture videos online but she just reads the PP. She's young and really doesn't seem to have much practical knowledge of the subject. She also added a lecture about white privilege that isn't even in the textbook. #woke","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzUzMzc3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1105","date_posted":"2024-12-02 17:12:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"this teacher was 3/5. posted the assignments at random times of the day. She would post 1 of the many lectures of the week on Monday afternoon, the next the next day. she is easy to reach/nice about grades. class was okay. hard part was the mandatory 300 word discussion posts weekly. 300 words was too much for the topics she wanted us to explain.

Quizzes are easy and you can retake your wrong answers and she has open note tests. She is incredibly nice and she really does love anthropology.
