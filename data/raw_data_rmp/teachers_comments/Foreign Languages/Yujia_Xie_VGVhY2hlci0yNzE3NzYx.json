She is funny, kind, and cares for her students. If you participate and study, the tests and exams are easy. You have a quiz each day, but they're easy as long as you review your vocab. Xie laoshi also helps you review a bit before each quiz. She is a wonderful teacher and has inspired me to continue learning Chinese!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDkwNzAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHIN1001","date_posted":"2024-12-31 05:23:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"she honestly really want you to do well in the class.
