Learning Korean is a lot easier when you are comfortable to speak out loud and she definitely makes this possible in her class. She is funny and is always willing to help. Prepare for weekly homework and the workbook. Overall, not too much work and not extremely difficult.

There's lots of reinforcement work, you actually need the textbook since you will do textbook exercises. There's a media presentation, vocab log, and two group projects (skit and final project, only two people).
