But her accent is very thick and I don't understand what she's saying, along with the speed she moves with new material and units. If possible, I would have chosen another professor.

She does not ever review exams after grading and only teaches from one sheet of paper for every unit; exams usually have questions not on the homework or on the teacher's notes. She expects you to write answers a certain way and will count them as incorrect if you do not phrase things properly.

As long as you pay attention, her lectures are clear and she repeats herself many times on what methods to use. She is good at explaining, but like most math classes it really is important that you go! Tests are fairly easy and are similar to the study guide and review. I would take her again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MTEyMzQy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
