It is the easiest math class ever, Professor Green is very straightforward and makes things easier for you and himself.

There is about 1 quiz per week (2 attempts each) and also some homework on each topic (graded for completion) that's due on the day the exam is due.

I think he's decent; you have to teach yourself everything because his videos are cut off and blurry. Don't even bother emailing him questions because he will not answer.
