Class was straight forward.  Multiple homework and test attempts.  Fairly easy A.  No late work accepted, but everything is open so you have plenty of time to get stuff done. Always answers emails and answers questions. I would definitely take her again.

Everything's on the Achieve. She posts exam study guides a couple of days before the deadline but they are not helpful. There were a lot of questions on the tests not even from the textbook and nothing like anything we did for homework. One of the tests has a mistake in the answer choice. HWs are easy to pass with 100% though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTg5MTc5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT2332","date_posted":"2023-07-22 20:00:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is super clear about how her course will go. She creates a schedule that tells us all the due dates for our assignments. It's important to remember that she won't take any late or missed work, so we need to stay on top of things.
