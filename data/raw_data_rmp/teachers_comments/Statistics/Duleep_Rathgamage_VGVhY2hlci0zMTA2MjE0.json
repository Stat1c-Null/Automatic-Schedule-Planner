Videos (by another professor) walk through the basics, but homework includes extra parts. Midterm & final are long &, imo, hard asl. They respond to emails w/ helpful explanations. Working w/ classmates helps. Truly understanding the lab/homework is key for the big projects. Be prepared to spend long hours\n","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzc2ODQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
