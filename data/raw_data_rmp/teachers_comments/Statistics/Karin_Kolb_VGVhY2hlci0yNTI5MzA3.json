Professor Kolb is amazing and you would have to try hard to not make an A in this class. You are allowed to use a note card as reference for all quizzes and tests. You don't have to study hard, or attend class. I never went but made detailed note cards and got an easy A!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDc4OTMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2020-01-23 20:11:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take Prof Kolb if you can get her! She is by far the best prof I have ever had. She's super caring and will help you through any problems or questions you have. Her lectures are crystal clear, so as long as you follow with the notes, you will get an A. She really does just want the best for her students. Highly recommend!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODYyNjY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2019-10-29 07:57:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"literally one of the nicest profs ive had this semester. shes a grad student and she understands the college struggle so she makes class as easy as possible! 7 quizzes, 3 tests, final (u can opt out if u have an A), and online hw. if u struggle w math, take her!!! she explains so clearly n the class itself is very easy. highly recommend!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzMwMDAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
