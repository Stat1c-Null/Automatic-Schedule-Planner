You have 2 mandatory performances to go to on the Marietta campus and an essay about them but she's a super easy grader. You also have to submit infographics and videos of you dancing.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjUzMDEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC1107","date_posted":"2025-05-09 11:12:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Only complaint is that she doesn't respond to emails in a timely manner. She even ignored all 3 emails about grading my discussion post I missed while sick. So, I just didn't receive a grade for it. 2 major essays with dance performance, discussions, and dance video assignment. Responses to discussion can be short, easy 100's.
