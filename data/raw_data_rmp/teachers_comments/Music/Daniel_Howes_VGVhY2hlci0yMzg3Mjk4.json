You don't need to know anything about the software before the class because his projects actually help you learn and they don't feel hard or rushed. One group project, the rest are individual, easy to access outside of class, 2 free absences. Willing to work with you on all projects. Take him if you get the chance.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzE5MjQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MEBUS2270","date_posted":"2021-01-10 23:49:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great Professor!! He is very kind, very knowledgeable, and is a great teacher. He is one of my favorite professors at KSU :) I highly recommend taking this class if you are getting into music production. They teach you the basics of production in Logic, and they also have an advanced class if you want to dive deeper into music production.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjYwNjE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He is probably THE coolest professor I have ever had. He used to be a traveling John Lennon in a Beatles Cover band and now he teaches audio production and other Mebus classes alongside Keith. Mebus is amazing. I recommend it to everyone interested in working in the entertainment industry in ANY way.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzA0NzQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
