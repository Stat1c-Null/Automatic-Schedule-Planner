He is super responsive; if you need help, he will provide it. He will also give you his famous motivation speech every week!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjYzMTgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Inspirational","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2024-05-28 18:03:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Mai was a cool guy, albiet not the most communicative. But, his class was easy and as with everything on Connect, you're given enough chances to pass with flying colors. His final is a little wack w being 7/8 essay-based questions (so just longer responses, but he grades very leniently on it)","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTI5MDM3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Inspirational--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2024-01-03 22:15:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was very easy, the lectures just covered segments of the book with added examples so I didn't watch a single one. Any basic knowledge of music theory is enough to explain the concerts with enough detail to get a 100 on the reports. Open-book activities and the weekly quizzes are not difficult at all.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODI3MDc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2023-12-21 19:53:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"His teaching style for the online class did not align with my preferred learning style. I found the lectures lengthy & uninteresting. I had limited interaction with him through the course, & when I reached out, I often got a delayed response. I liked hearing different music genres & writing three concert reports on concerts of our choice.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzY5MDA4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2023-01-03 01:01:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a good professor. His lectures were boring to me considering I'm not too interested in music history but he's perfect for you if you do. Class consists of 3 weekly assignments (time consuming), a test after every unit, and 3 concert reports. Not a bad prof if you can get through the busy work. Final is the only open response assignment.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Mjc0NjAz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2022-05-05 01:21:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Mai is a cool guy but the class was mostly busy work. Weekly homework that took a while and boring lectures. You will have to attend 3 concerts and write reports on them along with a group project.

However like most students who are required to take this class it just was not it. The final was essay based and listening based, there was numerous quizzes and 1hr smart book assignments every single week and essay concert reports. Just take it online.

I really looked forward to going to his class. It was tough, but he's always happy and has a way of inspiring his students to work harder. I especially enjoyed his impromptu lectures. Really poignant made me reconsider a lot of things. I would definitely take more of his courses and am planning to.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDEwNzI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CLASSPIANO1","date_posted":"2018-05-05 16:32:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Mai is great. He wants to help his students apply class piano to their actual careers, and he acknowledges that no one is, nor will be, a pianist. Must show up to class; he doesn't do makeup or late work without a legitimate excuse. He finds himself hilarious, which makes the class laugh. If you struggle, take advantage of his office hours.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTk2NTUw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
