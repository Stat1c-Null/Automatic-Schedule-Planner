Took her online. Had to post 2 discussion posts a week, had about 5 quizzes, one easy midterm, no tests, and 3 easy written assignment essays. Very good class to take.

Most classes are just open discussions on issues related to the topic. Attendance is worth a fourth of your grade, though, so you want to make it to every class.
