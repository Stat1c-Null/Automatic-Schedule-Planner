She honestly cares about her students and pushes you to your best! Open to creativity and is very understanding of circumstances. You WILL have to keep up with assignments as oil ink takes forever to dry so I highly recommend staying after class and carve ASAP to print on time!

We got to choose 4 discussions out of 10. The 3 tests were all multiple choice and were very easy to follow with the readings. The textbook clearly stated the answers and the discussions were easy. Just make sure that you read and follow the prompts. I've recommended it to several people already.

There were three test and 4 discussion post and a museum visit virtually or in person. She is very helpful but can be a tough grader when grading discussion. She likes posts to be fact heavy.
