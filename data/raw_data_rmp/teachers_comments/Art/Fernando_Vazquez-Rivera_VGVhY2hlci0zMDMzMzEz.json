He was great at critique by not being overly nice but not rude either; he provided great feedback that only furthered our understanding in the course. He's always willing to help and is very accessible outside of class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjE5NDQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
