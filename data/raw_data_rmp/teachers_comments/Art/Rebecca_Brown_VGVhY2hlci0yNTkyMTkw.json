Took maybe 15 min a week for like 2 quizzes a week. Art discussions seem heavy at first but are so easy and she doesnt grade harshly.

We do have discussion posts but they are spaced out and easy and short. An online website is used for HW and quizzes that are due each week but are very easy and take less than an hour. There are a total of 4 art criticisms throughout the semester and are pretty easy. She doesn't grade harsh.
