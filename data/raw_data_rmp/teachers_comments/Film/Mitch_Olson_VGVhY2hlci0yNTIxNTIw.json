Took his Writing for Film and TV course and loved it so the following semester I took his Advance course. First time I have ever been sad about a class ending. Really genuine guy that cares and invests in your work! The course itself is hard work, but its the one class I enjoyed every minute of it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTYzNzE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Respected","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FILM3105","date_posted":"2020-04-28 04:43:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"In 6 years of college Mitch is the best professor I have ever had. He deeply cares about his students and pushes hard for their success. He is so encouraging and knows so much about the film industry and screenwriting and he's so clearly passionate about sharing his knowledge. Take this class. It'll push you hard but it is so worth every second.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTQ0Nzc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FILM3105","date_posted":"2020-04-27 19:40:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fantastic professor. Enthusiastic, interesting, funny, and great at what he teaches - one of the best professors I've had in college. It's rare that I feel sad when a class is over, but I'm going to genuinely miss the workshop experience with my FILM 3105 class. If you want to take a screenwriting class, take it with Mitch.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTM5ODQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FILM3105","date_posted":"2020-04-27 19:39:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the best professors I've ever had.
