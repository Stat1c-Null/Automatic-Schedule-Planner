She does not accept any late work without prior approval&#8212;no matter what!! Make sure you email her several days in advance, as she takes a while to respond, and when she does, her replies tend to be passive-aggressive..\n\n","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjA5NTM5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4409","date_posted":"2024-05-07 22:25:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hugest waste of time and feels like material wasn't prior planned. Lots of busy work and be ready to answer questions because she won't move on until everyone contributes, she'll just stare and wait. She's very passive aggressive when you ask questions she's previously answered and never answers emails. I did not learn anything in this class.

Her class was fairly easy, and she genuinely cares about all of her students. She wanted to make sure we had enough time to complete every assignment and she did not want to stress us out. She is so understanding and will allow extensions as long as you communicate with her.

She was always willing to work with students and gave extensions on assignments when she could tell we were overwhelmed with other classes.

She really gives you information that you will want to use when you are a teacher. I've learned so much in her class. You have partner projects, group projects, and you come in and do a fun warmup that pertains with what you will be learning that day. Highly recommend if you want to learn great material!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTc2NjM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
