She's more worried about the well being of her students than about the crap from the school. Lots of in class projects. I would take her again. You don't learn much about math though, more about teaching in general.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjQzNTM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4408","date_posted":"2019-03-18 19:41:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Jessica is not only one of the most amazing professors I know, but also one of the most amazing people I know.
