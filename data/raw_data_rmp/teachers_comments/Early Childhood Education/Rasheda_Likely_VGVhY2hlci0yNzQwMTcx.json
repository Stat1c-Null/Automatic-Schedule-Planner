I also did not appreciate the tone in many of her announcements on D2l. She waited to enter final grades two weeks after my other professors had already had my final grade submitted through the college.

Her attendance policy is unnecessary, she takes off one point of your final grade for each day that you miss. Be prepared to be called on, she makes sure every student in the class participates at the end of every class. Grades work based on if she likes you or not. Take Dr. Collins instead.

She can be flexible and grades a bit on the harsher side. She is willing to help you & be flexible if you ask. Discussions every week, a few projects and a lot of peer feedback - which can be harsh on its own.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTkwNDQ2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4402","date_posted":"2022-04-19 23:13:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Likely is sweet, but she is a super tough grader. She makes it seem like she's super chill, but she's not. If you miss one class it's 5 points off your total final grade, even if you let her know before. She also will call you out in front of the class to answer questions if nobody raises their hand. She will give extensions on assignments tho.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTA3MTk5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4402","date_posted":"2021-11-19 17:58:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Likely is very kind and relatable and genuine. She's not there to trick you, she really wants you to succeed. THE MOST helpful professor in the ECE department in my opinion. There is no reason to fail her class, she's very easy. flexible attendance, just communicate and don't make a habit of skipping, you won't want to anyways.
