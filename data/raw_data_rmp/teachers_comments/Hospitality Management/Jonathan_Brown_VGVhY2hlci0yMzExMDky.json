To start he is the only teacher I have had that requires mandatory attendance since the pandemic. Classes are a snore and are canceled often with no regard to students' time or effort. He also hides things in hidden tabs of D2L. 100% do not recommend if there are other options","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzcxODQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2021-08-16 16:45:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"No tests, 16 quizzes- half lockdown, half open-note. Drops the lowest quiz. Easy group assignement. Professor has real-world experience in the restaurant industry. Bonus points for attendance. Fill in the blank notes.

Bc I took it in the summer it was a lot at once, but he didnt give tests and the majority of the assignments were reflective so it was easy. Theres a group project that you get randomly put into, but I had a good group so I liked it. Offers A BUNCH of extra credit &amp; drops lowest of 16 quizzes.

He clearly cares a ton about his students, and his class was one of the most useful for me so far. It may not be a super easy A, but it will be useful for your career. 3 Group Projects, Quizzes on each chapter, peer evaluations, and lots of participation grades. He also gives tons of extra credit!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjkxNTI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH4640","date_posted":"2018-05-04 19:05:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Brown makes sure you know this is not just a class where you drink beer, but he makes sure you understand what goes into the beer. Not just the process, fermentation, or history, he will teach you the marketing, biology, chemistry, sustainable practices, and MORE behind what goes into a beer.

He really knows his stuff and teaches it well. He is really good at connecting with students and having fun in class while still being able to teach.

He recognizes that there is a lot of information to cover and tries to make everything as clear as possible given the time constraints.
