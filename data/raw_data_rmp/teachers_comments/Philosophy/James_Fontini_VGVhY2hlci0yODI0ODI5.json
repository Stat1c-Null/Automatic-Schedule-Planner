His carefree approach to teaching the subject is incredibly refreshing and made the course one of the few I truly looked forward to. The class discussions are always enjoyable and enlightening, so while attendance isn't needed to pass, I'd really recommend you attend anyway.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NjcxNTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Inspirational--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
