It was a very easy class if you do the readings which aren't long and you don't have to complete them for the reflection assignments, as long as you answer the questions to your best knowledge/opinion it'll be fine. You should engage with the in-class discussions/lectures if you're wanting to get the most learning done.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTMxNDk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INTS1198","date_posted":"2025-04-30 13:16:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor. It's about 25 pre/post week assignments and they were easy. You have to keep up with your own grade but simply do the work and you'll know you have an A. Graded off completion but takes a while to grade. Class is easy, there is an optional final but if you don't do it you're gonna get an C in the class min. Took her for gwst1102.

Material wasn't difficult, but the readings were tedious with no feedback on assignments. You must guess your grade throughout the course as there is no actual gradebook, midterm grades, nor assessments. U can only get a 100 or a 0 on assignments, and she'd mark many things as 0 if she suspected AI use, even if that wasn't the case.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODIyMDE0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--So many papers--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INTS1198","date_posted":"2025-03-25 13:22:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly she's an amazing person and very kind and caring and loves what she does. I just think the class wasn't for me. Grading is unlike other classes and you don't get a grade until the end of the semester. Tons of reading each week for pre and post week reflections which are completion grades but you can do them with a friend which is nice.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODEzNTY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INTS1198","date_posted":"2023-12-13 17:49:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"This course was fine, it was really easy, I quite literally got a 100 on every paper and I know all of them weren't worthy of a 100. The professor is easy to reach through email, the only thing I wish was different was getting feedback on the papers.

She really is there to help if you need it. There is a lot of complicated articles you have to read and answer questions about so I'd say only take this class if it is apart of your major, but it definitely isn't an impossible course. No tests or quizzes and no need to buy a textbook.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzE4MzEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"So many papers--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INTS1198","date_posted":"2023-04-27 17:24:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"They are passionate, intelligent, and considerate.

The readings are pretty long and difficult at times, but try your best, and your effort will be well received.
