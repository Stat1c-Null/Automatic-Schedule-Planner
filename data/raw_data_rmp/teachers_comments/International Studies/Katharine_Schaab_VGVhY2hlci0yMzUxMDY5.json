I took her AMST 3740 course, which was highly discussion-based, where students would bounce off each other's ideas. In terms of course work, it was on the heavy side with either a 500 word discussion or a paper every week, etc. but if you let her know you're stressed, she WILL help you.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzc1Mzc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INTS1198","date_posted":"2024-04-24 16:54:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"AMST 3740: Kate is a wonderful professor as well as such a kind person. The class was made up of engaging with different types of media- novels, artwork, music, film- and writing discussion posts relating to dystopia. It is very easy to make an A in this class, just do your discussion post every week, come to class and you'll do great.

Much. Reading. Do not take her if youre looking for an easy, get it all done in one night class. If you have a full time job along with school, dont take her. Shes also a tough grader.

Super easy class, but important content. As long as you show up ready to participate and do the work assigned, you'll do well and actually learn a good bit.

Does not stop talking, and continues to try and get class participation when there is nothing to participate in.
