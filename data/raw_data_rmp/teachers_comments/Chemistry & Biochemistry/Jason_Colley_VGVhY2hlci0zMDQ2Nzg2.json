Only grades you on sig figs and completion. Didn't make below a 95 on a lab report. And he tells you exactly how he wants them. Lets you leave whenever you're done. Walls and engages with students and plays some cool music. Final wasn't too tough but do study.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjA4OTE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212L","date_posted":"2025-07-23 12:32:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Colley is very good for lab, because he also teaches lecture, so he understands what you need to know to complete the lab. He is very strict on the lab book and grading lab reports. No participation grades.

However, Professor Colley did his best to answer questions and be any form of support. Even brought us donuts on exam day. If you take notes in class and complete the study guides ahead of time you can pass the exams.
