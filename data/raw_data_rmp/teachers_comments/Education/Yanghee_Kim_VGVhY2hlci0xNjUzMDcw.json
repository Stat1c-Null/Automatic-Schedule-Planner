She is willing to work with you if there is a problem. However, I would not recommend taking her. It is possible to get an A, but I cannot say I learned much, if anything, from this class. Fortunately, I could carry over material from other classes. Four major papers. No tests/ just quizzes.

It can be a little difficult to understand her sometimes. Some of her assignments don't have rubrics, which make it hard to give her what she wants, and even if you ask her about it, you can still get lost on what you need to do and end up loosing points.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDIwNjg2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4","date_posted":"2011-12-09 16:23:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is super hard to understand as well as her not being able to understand you at times.

I was nervous to take her in case she had an accent but she is pretty easy to understand. She knows a lot about her subject and is very smart and encouraging. She is always there to answer questions.
