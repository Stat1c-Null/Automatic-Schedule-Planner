The expectations for each assignment are very clear. She is kind of a strict grader, but I believe that it is easy to get an A on each assignment if you try. I would highly recommend taking her!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjU0MzEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3305","date_posted":"2025-05-02 13:53:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed this class & the variation of assignments in class. The class is a mix of lecture, group work, Kahoots and table work. Most of the work is done in class so there is not a lot of outside time spent on the course. Easy course if you just do the work.

She makes the 3 hours somehow fly by and gives us work in class in a variety of ways, from group work to Kahoots. She has small activities in class that aren't \"serious,\" but we always learn something from them. She loves answering our questions and hearing from us. She's very down-to-earth and amazing!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODQ2MjM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3305","date_posted":"2024-12-09 01:13:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this professor she is so sweet!!
