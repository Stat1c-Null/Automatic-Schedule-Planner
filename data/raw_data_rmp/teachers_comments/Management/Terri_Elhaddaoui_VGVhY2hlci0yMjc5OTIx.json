Other than that, the assignments required in this course were manageable.  Several quizzes and discussions, however nothing extreme.  Great class and professor!

There are two group projects and two individual assignments which were relatively simple. All the papers are single-spaced. No lockdown browser.

Took her online for MGT 4171 and 4161 at the same time. 4161 was easy and had a few discussion posts, group proj, and couple of easy tests. 4171 was a TON of individual assignments, weekly discussion, group project, and two tests. 4171 was fairly easy but need time to do everything. She gives great feedback and clear grading.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODMxODQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4171","date_posted":"2018-10-30 14:55:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor E truly wants you to learn and do well in her class.
