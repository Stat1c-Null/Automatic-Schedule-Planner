My advice is to look up the excel templates for the textbook.\n\nScott is super nice and cares about students and what he teaches. Don't be afraid to reach out to him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTE0MDcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework--Caring","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
