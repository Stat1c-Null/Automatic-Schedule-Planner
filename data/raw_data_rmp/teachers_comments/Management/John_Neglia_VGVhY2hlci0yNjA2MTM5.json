If you want a super easy class that you can count on being an A at the end of the semester, take this class. Graded by easy smartbook quizzes every week, 2 case studies, and a final exam along with a group paper, which is easy if everyone puts in their work, but super easy grader!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzM4NDk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2022-03-06 16:09:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had him for MGT 7050 but for some reason that class is not possible to select. Overall he&#39;s a great teacher and would take again if given the chance. This particular class had a LOT of material crammed into a 7-week semester so it moves fast. His grading and assignments were fair. The final was a bit harder than I anticipated.
