I wish I could have taken him more. He challenges the traditional discourses of society and encourages differing viewpoints. You have to take him at least once! He gives you the space to think for yourself! Every class Ive had with him has been my favorite and his passion for people is seen in everything he does","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTAzMTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4100","date_posted":"2020-03-20 21:04:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"TAKE HIM!! Think Divergent/conspiracy theorist. Elevates you to think on a higher level, which is what college is SUPPOSED to do. I learned SO much from him.

He explained everything well. There are six 1-2 page papers every other week that are not bad. You will read them in groups and discuss them for a grade.
