It is just essay based and as long as you do the essay's, its an easy A. She gives you 2 weeks to review the lecture and the articles that she provides, and just using the articles and connecting it to the topics for the week, you'll pass.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTIzODg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2300","date_posted":"2025-03-19 17:48:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Love this professor. In her lecture videos you can tell she's very passionate about what she teaches. This class was very east for me, but only because I would prefer \"essays\" over tests. You have two weeks to read the material and write about it. There are no tests but what you learn is so interesting. She responds quick to emails.

The class is very easy, though it can be a little inconvenient to be in a 2 hour zoom meeting. There's a mid term and a final and 8 reflections- that's it. I got married at the end of last semester and didn't finish the course and she let me complete everything at a later time.

The class consists of 8 self reflections which is your personal experience with the modules concept. Each reflection is due every other week. She gives a clear example of what she wants, and really only grades on your personal reflection. I haven't finished this class yet but know I will get an A.

I enjoyed her videos and guest speakers. Self-reflections are required and I would advise you to do them because if you don't your grade will reflect it.

Class is very engaging and doesnt require busy work at all. She requires a self-reflection each week but as long as you do your best on them and follow directions youll do well!

I really liked her lectures, very insightful & opened my eyes to a lot. Love how she gives you information and lets you interpret it how you would like instead of carrying a bias. There is a lot of reading involved and about 8 self-reflection essays.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjA4MTI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
