I've never really programmed before this, but the format of the class made it easy to understand the basics of python. He's willing to help you + the class for our overall success. \n\nThere's program labs every two weeks or so, but he preps you beforehand to understand what you're doing. Each unit exam was fairly easy as well.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTc0MTIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1113","date_posted":"2025-07-29 23:27:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had this teacher for IT1114 but he was great. Discussion boards every week but the class was very easy. Your quizzes consist of basic multiple-choice questions and writing code but you have plenty of time to do them and you put them in an auto grader that will give you 0 or 100. Sounds daunting but it's not. Loved this class. All open notes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTMzMzEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1113","date_posted":"2025-05-06 23:29:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Haggerty was so funny. He told funny stories and made class enjoyable and I always looked forward to coming to class. There was one time when we were writing a program in class and he wanted common names to write into the program. My class and I said a celebrity name and he reacted so hilariously. Overall he always made us laugh especially me","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTg1NTcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT4153","date_posted":"2025-04-24 18:20:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"William was probably one of the best professors I've had at KSU, He is extremely lenient and caring for his students and always asks the students what he should do for certain things. He is extremely knowledgeable in his field which makes him a great professor.

Grades work pretty decent. If you don't like your grade, he will give you awesome feedback and it's up to you to correct it. If you do decide to, he gives you a 100. Has notes too in D2L for lost moments. He also answers his email ASAP.

Overall, the class was pretty easy, weekly discussions, quizzes each week (open note), and two tests during the semester(midterm and final). Test are lockdown browser but not with a camera.
