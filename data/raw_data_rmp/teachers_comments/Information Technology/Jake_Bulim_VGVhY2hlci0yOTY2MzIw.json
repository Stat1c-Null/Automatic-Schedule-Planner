There is an opportunity for extra credit, but the class is so easy you probably won't need it. Discussion posts require 500+ words, which is a little annoying, but there are only 2, and they are not hard. Assignments are very easy, but the first one was long. There is a lot of time between due dates.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTU4MTYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Graded by few things--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR2310","date_posted":"2024-12-06 16:36:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Bulim's class isn't necessarily hard I just feel like I didn't learn much.

Work is a few assignments scattered through the semester, midterm/final (locked/camera) but is just the quiz questions compiled into an exam. Weekly chapters and quizzes. He wants you to learn and isn't too bad of a professor honestly, just have to put some effort into studying the PowerPoint.
