His handouts basically matched his tests, as long as you looked over them you would get an A. Only 4 grades in 4 exams but they were very easy I got 100's on two of them and he dropped your lowest test grade. He was chill and didn't care if you came to class or not. I ended up with a 96 in the class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODI2NDMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON1101","date_posted":"2017-11-02 19:26:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher take him","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODI1MzAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LECTURE HEAVY--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON1101","date_posted":"2017-11-02 19:25:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I believe this is the best Econ teacher","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODI1Mjk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON1101","date_posted":"2017-11-02 11:51:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"EASY class!!

He wanted everyone to get an A. His test are 30 question and he only grades you on 26. You take 4 exams and he drops the lowest grade. He is always available and if he's not he will always answers emails or he will give you a call.
