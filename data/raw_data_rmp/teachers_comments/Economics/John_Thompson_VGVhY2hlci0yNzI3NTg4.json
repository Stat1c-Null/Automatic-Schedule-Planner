He gets right into the content and he does an amazing job explaining problems if you ask questions. As someone who is not good at math, Professor Thompson did an amazing job helping me understand everything. There is a ton of work, but he grades very easily and provides extra credit.

He wants his students to pass and the course work isn't hard unless you make it hard for yourself. There is a weekly homework (never hard to do) and 3 tests including the final. He provided an extra credit project at the end of the semester.

Every test has a study guide very similar to the exam and he gives pop quizzes for extra credit that help prepare for the exams.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODMzODU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2300","date_posted":"2023-05-28 17:32:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly shocked at the current rating that Prof T has. Everyone knows that BStat is hard so if you don't try, you're just not going to get it. Regardless of what prof you take. 3 exams, 13 hw assignments (which REALLY help as they focus on key concepts for exams). Lecture slides are very thorough & easy to comprehend.

Too smart to teach unfortunately. He is a research professor who had to teach and treated every class as a review session.
