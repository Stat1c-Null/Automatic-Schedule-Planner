She gives a lot of room for creativity and to do things you find interesting. You will get useful critiques after every project. definitely a good professor to take to make this class easier.

Honestly one of my favorite professors! Very chill and understanding teacher. Classes were fun. There was lots of talking and laughing throughout the semester.

I only got \"nice work,\" and a grade. I wanted more \"___ is a consistent issue, and you can fix it by __.\" \n\nBUT! She's fun and understanding with absences. It's easy to get an A if you just put effort in your assignments.
