The projects were actually really fun and even though they were challenging, she was always there to help. My final project was going horribblleee and she helped me come up with a new idea and even brought some supplies to help me complete it. Very caring and fun. Take her, you won't regret it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjE2NzY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1100","date_posted":"2025-05-02 04:00:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her 3D Design class and it actually completely changed my mind about sculpture. Her projects were clear to understand and not too difficult. She really encouraged me to develop my own style and was always happy to help.

Grades were very easy to get; she didn't care as much about skill as long as you were participating in class. Her feedback was also useful and she clearly cares about students' individual skills and progress in the class as well as pushing us to be creative instead of just following guidelines.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDk5OTQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1100","date_posted":"2024-12-31 21:33:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loveeddd taking Krista's classes (2D and Drawing I)!!
