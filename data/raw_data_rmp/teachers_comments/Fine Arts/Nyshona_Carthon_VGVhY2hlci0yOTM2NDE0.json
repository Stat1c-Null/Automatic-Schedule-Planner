There's tons of reading, and multiple lengthy projects every week. She does not teach you anything, the only &#8220;learning&#8221;you do is from the textbook. She does not care about your success in the class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTg1OTc4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2550","date_posted":"2025-05-03 13:54:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly this class was very difficult due to her inconsistent grading. She would frequently copy and paste the same critique she gave another student and that would lead to your critique having another student's name on it, so it was usually unclear if it was for you or not. She uses a textbook and there's a lot of work each week.

You will have likely two large assignments per week. She is very nit-picky, and her instructions for independent projects are often way too vague. Uses a textbook that is outdated and difficult to understand, and it's genuinely a nightmare.

Her goal is to help you familiarize yourself a bit more with adobe, so her projects require you to use certain tools in your designs. In my case it didn't help me create what I want, but now I know more tools from it. I learned new things.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjQ0ODU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3021","date_posted":"2023-12-13 01:54:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you have the choice to take her or a different class, don't take her. She's nice and doesn't grade hard, but if you're looking for actual critiques on your work to become a better designer, she doesn't provide them. The class is 3 hours long, and the majority of the time you sit there doing nothing.
