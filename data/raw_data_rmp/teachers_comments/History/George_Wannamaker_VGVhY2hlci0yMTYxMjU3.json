He jumps around from time to time to connect events but just pay attention, it'll make sense. He makes the 2 essays sound scary at the beginning of the semester but they are not, they're actually interesting and fun. Just apply yourself, do your work and you'll get an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTAyNDA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--Would take again","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2017-12-07 00:04:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is very caring and tries to be funny but he expects you to know everything about history. He has projects that can help boost ur grade and gives a a few extra credit opportunities. If you enjoy history or your good at it i would take him, if not i would try and avoid. Each test has an essay portion besides the final exam.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDc0Njg0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Tests are tough--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2017-04-27 16:53:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a really nice guy and I enjoyed the class. Attendance is not mandatory but he does do a sign-up sheet and to see who is in class possibly if someone ever needs there grade bumped. There are quizzes and projects but follow instructions and you'll get an A in them. He also offers extra credit assignments.

He gave way too much work for the course level, but he also gave a lot of extra credit.  His tests are essay and multiple choice but he lets you do the essays outside of class, which was great. I would avoid him, but if you don't have the option you'll still be fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjY5MDMx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2016-12-18 18:00:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easiest class so far in college. Final grade was literally over 100. There are 2 projects you have to do at home but they are easy and easy 100s, and 25% of the final is bonus, I made a 130% on it.
