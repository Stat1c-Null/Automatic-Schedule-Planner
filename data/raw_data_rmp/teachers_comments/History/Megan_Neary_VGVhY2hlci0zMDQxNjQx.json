It's not hard to follow. If you have issues with your eyesight, sit closer to the board. She clearly has a passion for what she is teaching.

The people here who complain about  her talking about women most likely just dislike women for whatever reason. Reading responses were frustrating at times and the labs as well, but go to class and you'll be fine.

The class was extremely frustrating. There is a reading response every single night almost and sometimes the source for them is a 2 hour podcast.

However, she ties everything back to women, (picking apart everything they could and could not do in every single part of history).
