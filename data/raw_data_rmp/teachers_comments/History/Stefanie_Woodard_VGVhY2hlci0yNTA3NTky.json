At times she teaches inaccurate material and for someone with a Ph.D., says, &quot;I'm not sure&quot; a lot. It's obvious she is uncomfortable lecturing about topics outside of her majors/minors. She is slightly passive aggressive and I would not recommend!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTEyMzU2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Beware of pop quizzes--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2019-12-12 07:02:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"The difference between a good and great professor that both teach the material well is one who is passionate and cares. Dr. Woodard is one of them! Super clear grading criteria, has study guides, extra credit opportunities, but just make sure to do the discussion readings and participate. Downside is notebooks only and no electronics or laptops","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjI0ODM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2019-12-05 21:18:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Cares about her students well being, but also a great professor. No electronics allowed during class, but extra credit for turning them in. 2 reading assignments a week, 3 exams including final. 3 absences allowed. Easy class to pass as long as you do the assignments, and participate. Plenty of extra credit as well.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTQwNzQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Skip class?

She makes class very fun even though there is a lot of participation. Her humor is nerdy but adorable. I have really enjoyed her as a professor because she really cares about what she does as a profession. She is simply AMAZING!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDc2MzM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
