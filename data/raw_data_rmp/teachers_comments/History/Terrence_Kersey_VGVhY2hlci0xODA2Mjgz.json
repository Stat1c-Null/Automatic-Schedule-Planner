I'm very good at history and he makes me hate the subject and very difficult. He does not excuse anything. He does not give enought time for exams either! Do not take him at all! Worse teacher in KSU. Even complained to the department.

It is wise to listen. I appreciate the weekly reports,summaries, that expands my knowledge on significant historical events that shaped America. It is an easy, reading and comprehension class.

He isn't clear about anything, he just rambles for the ENTIRE class. You will never get out early, even if we've covered everything. Attendence is mandatory. His tests are near impossible. He takes it way too seriously for a basic history class.

If there was a more incompetent instructor in the entire social services building, I do not want to know about them. He put the exams on D2L with no understanding of D2L itself. Several times the exam would have flaws and misspellings and would even count a right answer wrong.

He is never clear about what is on the test at all. He just expects you to remember very concept from the lectures and gives you no study guide.

Lectures are pretty dry, but his insights are interesting. The final and midterm are worth both 40% of your grade (80% total).
