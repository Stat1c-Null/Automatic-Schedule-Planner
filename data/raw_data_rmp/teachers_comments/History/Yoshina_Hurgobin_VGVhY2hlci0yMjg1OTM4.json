It's just an average college class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTI2ODY4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1100","date_posted":"2017-11-08 08:17:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lectures were typically VERY boring, there is new reading each week, she can become irritated if information isn't absorbed quickly by student and will call you out, the way that she lectures and writes on the board makes notes impossible to take (Arrows EVERYWHERE), two fairly easy papers, and above average test. Participation is also a must.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU2NDIy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

She really cares about your success. She is always trying to help you understand fully and makes you feel comfortable to ask questions.
