Although we switched to in person exams because of cheating she was so caring, nice and very lenient when it came to assignments and quizzes. Definitely get to know her and utilize office hours, and after class time so she can get to know you. Easy class.

She is so quiet you can't hear anything she says. Gives a take home lab every week and they are hard. Tests are impossible. She reads from a powerpoint downloaded from online.
