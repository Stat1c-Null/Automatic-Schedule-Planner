He really tries to intimidate you on the first exam but if u use common sense and take your time it is easy. Made 100s on all the test by just checking my work. Requies basic but confident math skills.

His lectures are extremely fast, and do not really show you how the questions will be asked on tests or quizzes.  I would avoid this class if possible.

Do your homework, he goes over it, the next class you have a quiz, so its a quiz every class. Make sure your quizzes are corrected cause you will use that on the test. As long as you try, you will enjoy this class.

Most tests and quizzes are open book. The professor teaches too fast and becomes impatient when students asks questions. He is very picky and will even take points off if you forget to put the date on your quiz. Other than that, the class is ok. I would avoid taking him again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2ODg4MTEx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SURV2221","date_posted":"2009-11-02 17:33:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the best teachers ever. If you don't want to do homework don't take him. If you do the work and pay attention you will be fine, and actually learn a lot.  He tries to scare people in the beginning but its not bad.  He is very funny, and he makes it easy to pay attention during that long class. tests and quizzes are mostly all open book.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzAxMzEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SURV2221","date_posted":"2009-07-29 23:57:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher, seems to really enjoy teaching.

He is always there to help since he is always in his office late.  He is also a nice guy.  You have to put in a strong effort in his class.
