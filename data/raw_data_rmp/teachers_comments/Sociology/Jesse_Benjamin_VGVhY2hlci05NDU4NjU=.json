Primarily discussion based every class. Didn't care about attendance nearly all semester until close to the end. Very lax and chill but serious about the issues at hand. No real work to do until the end when all his assignments are due, which were not hard but time consuming. No final exam.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTUxMTY4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCRACE","date_posted":"2010-04-24 19:24:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extreme radical views about race all over the world; not the norm.

Additionally, most people on this campus are not fond of these types of views because they are generally close-minded rural people. But on another note, he is flexible, smart, and willing to listen. Realistically, i don't think many people on campus can handle it.
