If you come to class, do the readings, take advantage of the extra credit, and complete the study guides you will make a good grade. He is passionate about sociology and it shows. He makes class fun and I would definitely take him again! My favorite professor in the department so far.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzcyNjk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2251","date_posted":"2015-11-05 10:40:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hands down one of my favorite teachers! I  wouldn't say that there is an unreasonable amount of outside reading (about 30 mins per class). There are quizzes but if you look at the reading questions before hand you'll be fine. The test are pretty straight forward just go through the study guide. HE IS BEYOND HELPFUL, just ask. best lectures. show up","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQ5MTE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3301","date_posted":"2015-01-06 00:18:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Starks is by far my least favorite professor I have taken at KSU. He is extremely unhelpful and has unreasonable expectations of students. The readings he assigns are fairly lengthy, and are worded in such a way that one not familiar with religious sociology will find extremely difficult to understand. He also assigns a lot of his own writings.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjM1NzIw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI","date_posted":"2014-12-15 11:37:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall He is really tough! However he is just very intelligent. He likes to help you just have to ask for it.

A few last minute reading assignments (less than 24-hours notice.)  Even though classes were on TuesdayThursday, assignments due on Saturday, which effectively made it a 3-day class instead of a 2-day.  Would not take a course with him again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzOTE5NTkx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
