Took her for Med Soci and I looked forward to going to class. She's not hard to please; there's a wkly ch summary due & students are responsible for leading a ch discussion. Tests aren't bad.

Material is very in depth and intense at times. Exams are quite difficult and the best way to be prepared is not to ask what to study for, just review everything that may be included.
