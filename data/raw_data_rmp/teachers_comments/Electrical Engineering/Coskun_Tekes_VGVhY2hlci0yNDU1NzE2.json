He is a great lecturer and makes topics very simple to understand, he does care about you learning and will go above and beyond to help you. Go to class and you'll do great in the class. The tests, labs, and homework's are all based off of what he teaches you.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTI0OTUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CPE4010","date_posted":"2023-12-13 15:35:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lectures for this course were extremely heavy with some of the modules containing over 100+ slides, but he tells you the important concepts to focus on. There were 2 exams, some homework, labs, final project, & a final. The project requires you to use all the sensors that you learn about in lab. While attendance isn't mandatory, I recommend going.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjQ4MDk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CPE4010","date_posted":"2023-02-26 18:11:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"4010 is good with Tekes. He has a lot of information on his slides, but as long as you just listen to what he says/writes on the board then you won't get overwhelmed. Labs are fun for this course and not too challenging.

Honestly, really wish I took 4010 with someone else. Reads and depends on his slides, which are overbearingly long. Expect to memorize and not learn in this course, as that's how it's structured. Also, quizzes and tests are almost unfair.

Control systems is a hard subject but I think I was able to learn a lot from him. Gives feedback and replies emails on time, and he cares about his students.

He's a nice Professor and will help you out. He double check your exams before you submit it to make sure at least doing the problem correctly and tells you to go redo the problem.
