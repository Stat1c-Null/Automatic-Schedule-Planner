Dr. Ho is very nice to have a conversation with. Attendance matters so make sure to be there every lecture and try your best in assignments. You should be fine since assignment is worth only 60% rest 40% attendance.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjkxMzg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CPE1000","date_posted":"2025-04-28 18:23:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class is extremely straightforward, and Professor Ho is very clear with what needs to be done.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDcyMTcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CPE1000","date_posted":"2025-01-07 17:18:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing teacher, TAKE HIM!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTAwMjMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CPE4903","date_posted":"2024-05-21 20:37:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Ho's Machine learning class was an interesting class filled with assignments that helps understand the theory of Neural Networks.

The lectures are available online, my advice is to just sit and watch him derive the equation, then take pictures of the board. It's easy to miss something he said because you're too busy trying to write it down. Only midterm and final, not to bad, just study.
