Her quizzes are straight fwd; know the reactions and percent yield. She creates the lab final, which is similar to her quizzes. If you email her your lab report a few days before it's due, she'll send you feedback. Very easy going and laid back lab. Took her for both ochem labs. Highly recommended!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MTU5MzEw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEML3361","date_posted":"2010-11-04 09:36:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her grading is the most difficult I have experienced for a lab. She posts guidelines, but if you add too much or too little she deducts points. That being said, she is a wonderful lab instructor and you can tell she loves what she does.

A nice and eclectic chem professor with a good sense of humor. The lab was like any other intro chem lab, dry and not very helpful, but Jackie acknowledged this and dived the work among the groups so we usually got out of there within an hour.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTc3OTU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEML1211","date_posted":"2010-02-03 18:53:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"I thought she was a great lab instructor.

The quizzes are taken from the pre-lab notes. The formal papers were tough so plan enough time to complete them. Definitely get help if you bomb the first one.
