He doesn't just read off slides, instead using them as an outline. He shows  shortcuts on complicated topics that makes it 10x easier to understand. Extremely nice and geneuinely cares about his students. Homework isn't heavy but make sure to keep up with it weekly. Practice exams are also very similar to the test.

Excellent professor with a really easy grading criteria. Took this for a summer class and we literally had very minimal work. Professor Monge is very laid back and just tells you exactly what you need to get done, pushing out any unnecessary assignments or lectures and focuses on what needs to be taught.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTIxODYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM-1211","date_posted":"2025-04-30 13:18:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"loved his class! was very straightforward in lectures and highlighted what would be on exams. gave a lot of practice worksheets that were optional with keys posted online. final is broken into parts from the unit exams which replaces your unit exam grade if it's higher which i think is awesome! caring professor would definitely take again :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDk4NTI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM-1211","date_posted":"2025-04-30 01:20:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is the best professor I've ever had. So funny and caring, and is always available! Chemistry is hard but he makes it a lot easier to understand. He's always willing to meet for office hours as well. If you want to do well you do have to attend class but most of the time he would let us out early. The class wasn't easy, but that's just chemistry.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDk0NDQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM-1211","date_posted":"2025-01-07 16:46:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Funny and entertaining lectures. Would recommend showing up to class because the content is hard and the D2L notes are not in depth. Start the weekly homework sooner rather than later. Tests were hard but that just might be chemistry. Good to have prior chem knowledge because it's a lot easier to understand.

If you come to him for help, he will help you and he won't make feel stupid while doing it. And also he's pretty funny, so you can atleast laugh while crying over chemistry. 10/10 would take again.

Unlike others, he never made me feel stupid or belittled when I asked questions. Just reach out to him&#8212;he's quick to respond and supportive.
