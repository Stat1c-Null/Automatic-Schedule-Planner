He explains concepts clearly and takes time to answer all questions. His practice exams are extremely helpful and very similar to the actual tests. He also curves generously, which helps a lot.

I dont know how I didn't get him for lecture but Bertoli is the creme de la creme' of Organic Chemistry.

I took him for the Ochem lecture and thought it would be impossible to get an A, but I got an A. The tests are just like the practice tests. He will answer any emails, even late at night, but you do have to study. Ochem isn't a class you can get by in, so you have to work, but he makes it doable.
