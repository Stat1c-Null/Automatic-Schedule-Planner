She solves any problems you have one by one, and doesn't mind working with you on extra problems you may struggle with. CHEM 1211 is known to be hard, but during my semester with Prof Marshall I barley had to worry.

She cares a lot about her class. She checks attendance by doing these \"clicker questions\" which is a completion grade in the form of a Microsoft Forms question on the material we are learning that day but she posts the slides before the class so you can do it from home.

Her lectures were easy to follow along and she always posted the slideshows. She's always open to questions and does a review session before each test. The practice exams are exactly like the tests.

She will explain things in class and is willing to answer a lot of questions during her lecture. However, there is barley any extra credit.
