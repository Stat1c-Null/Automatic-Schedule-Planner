He takes points off for every little thing that you do. When you ask for help he tells you it is very simple and does not provide an explanation what so ever. if you have the chance to take a different teacher, take another teacher.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDM5MDQ2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Really hard to ask for help as he assumes you know everything already. Do NOT take him if there is another option.

Quizzes and content assessments are online and basically a review from chem lecture. If you do your work and be precise on your lab reports, you'll make an A.

He specifically told our lab class he would be rounding up grades if we were close to getting an A. I got an 89.99 and was denied being rounded up because of unfairness to other students.

He can be hard to understand because his accent is very heavy, but he is extremely caring and wants everyone to do well. The online portion of the class is pretty easy, and the labs aren't awful.
