He has a relatively thick accent but after a week or two he's understandable. O-Chem is a hard class no matter what and there wont be an easy A in organic chem. He tries really hard to help and his office hours are very group oriented so you get help from him and other students.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODQ1OTg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

When he explains stuff is in such weird ways that you'll end up even more confused when he's done with lecture. Tests are insanely difficult and all free response. However, he's really sweet and reminds me of a Big Bang Theory character, so there's that.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODE2MzAx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":8,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM3362","date_posted":"2017-10-29 15:03:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Cool dude, but very hard tests. Whole semester is 500 points: 3 exams, 1 final, and 100 points worth of take home quizzes. You can do quizzes in his office with him, and final replaces lowest test grade. Exams are harder than they need to be (all free response), and there's no curves. He's chill though, so there's that at least.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Nzk4NDk3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":8,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM3362","date_posted":"2017-10-29 15:00:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Literally one of the most personable and sweetest professors I've ever had, but he's SO HARD! When I say hard, I don't mean in the sense that you walk out learning a lot. I mean you walk out confused about what he said, and his tests are nightmares. Exams have been all free response so far, and they take the whole time. Again, great guy, but HARD!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Nzk4NDg4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":7,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM3362","date_posted":"2017-10-26 19:27:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"The legit reviews of this guy keep getting deleted. I'll be as real as I can before this is deleted. He is a VERY sweet and caring guy, but his tests are HARD. No curves on his exams either. Also, sometimes when he teaches he talks about stuff in very complex terms, so go to SI sessions and extra tutoring! Great guy, but harder than he need to be.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NzkwNjkx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":10,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM3362","date_posted":"2017-10-23 23:12:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have enjoyed every lecture Dr. A has delivered so far. As they all say at KSU - you'll need to earn your grade and he is no exception. He requires you to read regularly. Don't take his class if you are looking for an easy &quot;A&quot; - he says he won't curve the class. Your Orgo-1 concepts need to be solid to do well in his Orgo-2.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Nzc0Nzcx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":10,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
