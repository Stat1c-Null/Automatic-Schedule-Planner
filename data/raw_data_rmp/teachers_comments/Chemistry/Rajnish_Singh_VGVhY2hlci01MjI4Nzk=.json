Willing to help and explain any material not understood. If you actually study before the test (meaning every other night, not the day before an exam) you will do well. Some test questions are tricky, but it isn't anything she hasn't mentioned or gone over. Read the book, study the notes, and you will survive.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNzA0Mzc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1101","date_posted":"2007-10-27 22:48:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"She sucks as a teacher.

Self conscious about everything, thats why she yells if you speak in class.  Reading the book doesnt help, test questions are random. Easily confused, which may work to your advantage.
