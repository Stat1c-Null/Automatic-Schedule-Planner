He's good at relating what we're learning to things in the real world that we already know. He gives crystal clear explanations, takes time to make sure everyone is on the same page, and really coaches students through the material.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDIzMzQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM3500","date_posted":"2012-10-23 20:03:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"No unnecessary busy work and he is very straightforward about everything on his exams.  He goes out of his way to make review sheets for exams that are exactly what will be on exam and he meets with ANY student that needs help whenever he can.  Extremely approachable and willing to help.  You can tell he is genuinely likes Biochemistry.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzI5OTE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1152","date_posted":"2012-05-13 18:42:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hard class. Great professor. I learned so much. Makes his lectures very clear. Explains everything thoroughly and encourages students to go to office hours--which he often extends for student convince. Homework is long, however it really does help you understand the material. Tests are extremely difficult. You earn the grade you receive.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjcxODc3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1152","date_posted":"2012-05-03 11:49:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very hard class in general but his tests were hard but very fair. He drops the lowest test grade and you even have a homework grade, but the homework takes for ever! He stays after class and in his office a lot for extra help, but seems a little unapproachable.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTg1NzA2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1152","date_posted":"2012-04-15 11:53:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Meades IS a hard teacher, but IT IS organic chem. The homework is extensive, but helps with keeping up with the material. He comes in 3 hours early to help students and will stay as late as you need him to. He knows his stuff, too !

Every test we had the average was around a 50%. Offered some extra credit but only bc if he didn't, everyone would have failed. Mandatory homework in ridiculous amounts. Made a B but only by staying up all night and reading my book. Wouldn't recommend him if you aren't good with Chemistry!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDA0MTk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
