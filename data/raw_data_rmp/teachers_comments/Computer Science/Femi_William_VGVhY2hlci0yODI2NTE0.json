He also taught us some of the algorithms incorrectly and we had to correct him a few times on quizzes or assignments. He also is bad at preparing us for our tests and just throws a whole list of topics at us rather than what he actually cares about.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTYyNDM3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4306","date_posted":"2023-12-22 01:32:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is one of the worst I've taken in my degree. His lectures are not very helpful because he only reads off the PowerPoint slides and is hard to understand. He also only covers each concept once in class and expects you to memorize it. To top it off he is very disrespectful to students in class when asking questions or when presenting.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzcyMzAw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4306","date_posted":"2023-12-11 02:47:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor ive had in my degree so far. Deserves to be fired. Thinks hes right even though the whole class points out his mistakes multiple times. The ONLY resources are his awful 30 minute lectures, and NOTHING else. No other ways to study for his awful, horribly worded tests and quizzes. The whole groupme hated him, KSU is a joke now.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjAzNTYw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"cs4612","date_posted":"2023-12-11 00:51:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Im not going to waste yall time.

The project was the worst (not completing the project but the actual presentation) - he gives you a strict time limit to present, but during your presentation he will talk over/interrupt just very rude infront of the class. He does the same in other classes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTM1Mzg5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4306","date_posted":"2023-11-05 21:45:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"The only good thing about this professor is he's a lenient grader. He takes attendance for a grade, so his lectures are mandatory, but all he does is read off powerpoint slides. Combative towards students, gives very vague project instructions with no guidelines.

Mandatory lectures. Quizzes/tests are only announced in person via a quick comment. He's not big on D2L. Combative towards students. However, easiest grader I've ever had.

Good flow! But to score high, we have to attend every class to catch up with the knowledge that he delivers! One of the best professors to date for me at KSU. Have an interest in learning - for future interviews and a good project for your resume. He helps & lenient in grading. Be self-driven!
