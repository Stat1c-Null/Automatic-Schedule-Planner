Clearly explained materials and had no problem reexplaning if you were struggling. Gave plenty of extra credit opportunities and quizzes are open notes. Easy A with a little effort.

The work is tedious and monotonous. 10 quizzes and 3 tests (in class but open book). The semester long group project will be the most time consuming part of the class but very little guidance is given to the coding/technical aspect of it. Start early if possible.

Does not have video lectures which can be an issue sometimes, but very responsive to emails and will give you feedback on assignments before they are due. Tests are not bad, going over the slides right before the exams will help a lot with oddball questions. Solid for an 8-week.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4Mjk0MTAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE3313","date_posted":"2023-05-02 20:01:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"She took the time to make instructor notes of her own which were much easier to understand than textbook and is very accessible outside of class.
