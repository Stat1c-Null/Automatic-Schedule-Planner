Grade is fully based on 3 tests through D2L. Attendance was mandatory for the Maymester, I don't know what his policy is for a full term course. He's a charismatic lecturer and it's easy to pay attention during his lessons.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzMyODUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Hilarious--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2021-12-07 17:39:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Peiper's powerpoints were very vague but then he would talk on them for multiple minutes leaving you wondering if you needed to be writing down what he was saying. 3 tests make up the whole grade. The tests were mostly made up of information not found in his powerpoints. To be honest, it's the first B I've gotten since middle school.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1Mzk5OTIw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He is super passionate about politics and it overflows into his teaching. In this class, there were three tests, and those were the only grades, but attendance is mandatory. You are allowed to miss 2 classes without penalty and after that, your grade drops by one point for each absence.
