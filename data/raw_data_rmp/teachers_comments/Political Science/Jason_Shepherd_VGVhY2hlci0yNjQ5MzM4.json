People rated him well so I think he just seems more aloof online. Its reading heavy and I didn't like that, it was boring. I also did an extra credit opportunity for 15 points and he didn't grade it. If he did, I would have actually passed the class.

He's passionate and knowledgeable, and it will be to your benefit. My biggest gripe is that 80% of our tests were from the textbook and not gone over in class- his tests were long and tedious, and there was really only 3 exams and 2 papers, but I just prefer to be taught in class.

My largest complaint is that he takes until the end of the semester to put your grades in for the Written Assignments (which you have four of), and other grades also come in really slow.
