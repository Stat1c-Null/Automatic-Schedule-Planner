Essays lacked guidance, and the open-book tests were unhelpful unless you had transcripts. Despite improving my grades, I still got a B. Not a supportive or fair professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzg3NzA5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARH2850","date_posted":"2025-04-13 22:40:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Whatever you do, DO NOT take this prof. She's a tough grader, which already sucks, but she also rarely (if ever) gives guidelines for grading. If you want to improve your grade, good luck. I once got a B on an exam and received no feedback whatsoever. How am I supposed to improve? It's like she just doesn't like giving A's or something.  No way.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTMwMjU4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARH2850","date_posted":"2024-10-25 03:39:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"She has some bad reviews but I've honestly enjoyed this class. I like how she does the weekly modules and that I can work at my own pace. The weekly quizzes are not timed and are open-note, so the textbook can be used. The exams are hard. The first half is multiple-choice but the second half is essay questions. She is a tough grader too.

Exams are open book but we can't rephrase what we read, if we put information in our own words it's not &#8220;specific&#8221; enough, if we rephrase other sources outside of the book material, it's &#8220;cheating&#8221;.

She is extremely fussy with grading and does not offer any remotely helpful feedback when you reach out. Her recorded weekly lectures are very surface level and point out irrelevant details that don't add much to the context of the time period. Overall a frustrating class.

Dumps too much essay writing and useless information, which is overwhelming. Note taking barely helps for the 3 exams you have to take because she doesn't tell you what's important to write and what isn't. She doesn't believe in study guides and is very vague in helping students who are reaching out for help.

I have had since beginning college. Her lectures are only pictures, no notes to take, and 3 videos a week on average.
