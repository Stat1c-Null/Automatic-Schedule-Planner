There are a lot of assignments, but they are relatively easy and quick. There is a group project but he gives you plenty of time, and doesn't penalize you for group members not pulling their weight. There's a lot of extra credit assignments as well to keep your grade up.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTU5Nzg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ASTR1000K","date_posted":"2025-05-02 03:10:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"AMAZING PROFESSOR!

All of the work is on a science site where answers can be found on Quizlet. 4 tests & 1 final. The tests are lockdown/cam, but he shows you a preview of all of the questions before hand! There is SO much extra credit! Some of the labs you can turn in for extra credit & he will give you an automatic 100. Don't be scared to take!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDI1MDY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ASTR1000K","date_posted":"2024-12-12 13:32:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class as an elective, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about astronomy with this professor. Despite it being an online class, the interactive software we used during the semester was very informative. The professor gave detailed feedback with many large assignments, and communicated what could be done to improve.

He is the sweetest he is too nice he gives a lot of chances to do his work he emails a lot of reminders and is VERY understanding if you need more time do any work!

He is disorganized, overwhelms you with material, and is overall terrible. He should not be teaching in general. if you are considering taking this as a fun class, STAY AWAY! It's not fun and you will be drowning in work.

His tests never correlate with the material we were learning, his lectures don't help to pass the tests. We had a power outage and he still expected everyone to take a test that same day regardless of everyone's situations. We explained this to him on numerous occasions and he doesn't do anything about it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzQ5MDY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
