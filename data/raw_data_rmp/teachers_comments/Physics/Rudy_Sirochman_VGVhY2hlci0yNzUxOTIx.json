You mostly just follow directions in class, do the lab, then do the worksheet. That's it, that's all you have to do to pass the class. NO final exam, no midterm, all worksheets done in class all year.

He would thoroughly explain the concepts behind each lab and the actual procedures. If we had any questions, he was happy to help. He seemed to enjoy the class which made it a very comfortable environment. He also made an effort to talk to every student and know their name which was sweet.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjIyMTA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2212L","date_posted":"2025-04-26 00:43:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Love the guy.

Highly recommend taking him as he's a very lenient grader, yet also seeks to help you learn through thoughtful pre-lab lectures and hands-on labs. He's retired and an expert in his field - and very funny. Highly recommended.
