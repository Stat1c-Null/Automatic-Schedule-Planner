I was initially hesitant to take her course after seeing such a deceptive review about her, but she is the best. Lab was super easy, no question is a dumb question to her, she is always helpful.

Very respectful and never shut the door, students would come in like 30 minutes before class ended and would still have the opportunity to earn a 100 on the lab. She took the time to explain something if you were confused and if something was not adding up with your work, she would stay and help solve it.

At least half of the tables got up and left because we could not handle being talked down to so much.
