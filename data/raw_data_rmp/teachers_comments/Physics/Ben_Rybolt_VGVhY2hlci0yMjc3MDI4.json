He really wants to see you understand the material, but physics is awful and he isn't great in lecture. Most of the class is conceptual but tests are math based. Homework each week is difficult, four exams, and he gives extra credit and chances to rework missed problems.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODAwOTM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2017-10-28 11:59:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Rybolt is very nice and gives you a chance to rework problems you missed on a test in order to earn points back.
