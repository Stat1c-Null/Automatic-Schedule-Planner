He contradicts himself from time to time and even doesn't know how to solve a problem here and there. He gives extra credit for tests but only because the class does so bad on his tests. He is a harsh grader and takes WEEKS to grade a simple assignment.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjA5MTky","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2025-05-01 02:24:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Often contradicts himself in between solving a problem, and I learned all the material through previous knowledge and hw.

His lectures are basically copy and paste from the textbook, and wouldn't know how to answer questions about the material. He is very disorganized, and inconsistent to follow throughout lectures.
