Avoid, I'm not joking here. After the first test there were some people with tears on their eyes, and he doesn't care if you win or if you lose. Hey McDaniels, do the world a favor and retire from being a teacher for life.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NjI0NjQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1073","date_posted":"2008-02-27 18:12:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Due to his lack of experience and personality Dr. McDaniels is without a doubt a mediocre proffessor with an extremely high withdraw and failure rate.
