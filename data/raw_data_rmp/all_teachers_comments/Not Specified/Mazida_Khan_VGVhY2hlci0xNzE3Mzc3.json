All of the test are just papers. You will be required to do a peace project. You have to buy 3 books (that you will need) so beware of that. Overall an amazing class. It was an elective for me but I changed my major and no longer needed it but I don't regret taking it at all. It was a great class and great prof.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2Mzk1MzM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAX1102","date_posted":"2016-04-21 12:18:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet lady and very helpful. Participation and attendance really matters in this class. Can be confusing on directions for projects and exams but very helpful every time I've been confused. Not an easy class, you definitely have to put forth the effort, but getting an A isn't hard if you do so. I'd take her again","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzQ2MTI5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAX1102","date_posted":"2015-12-08 11:18:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Kahn is very sweet, and she is very specific on what assignments are. She does not to test, instead she does essay exams, but she emails the guidelines which are very specific and goes over it the class before it's due. Easy A and you'll learn some good life lessons.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTg2ODAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"AMST3760","date_posted":"2015-07-22 11:22:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is an AMAZING professor! Seriously! Her lectures are interesting and brief, followed by class discussion in open forums. She wants the class to teach her as much as she is teaching the students.
