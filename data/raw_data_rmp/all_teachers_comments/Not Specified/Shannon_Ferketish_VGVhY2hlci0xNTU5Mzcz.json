She's very out going, social, and laid back. You'll have a lot of fun in her classes. However, don't get me wrong, even though she is a great professor, you WILL be doing service projects, you will have to study, and do work. 5/5. :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4OTY5MzI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3400","date_posted":"2011-04-07 20:27:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing class!
