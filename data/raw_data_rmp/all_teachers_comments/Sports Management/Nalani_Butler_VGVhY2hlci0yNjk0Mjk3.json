Quizzes are generally 10 questions(require lockdown browser + webcam). She offered so much fun volunteer extra credit, if you don't do too well in the fall or spring you can still pass with an A from extra credit alone. Gave me an extra chance to complete an assignment.

She told us to get a textbook but I never used it and still got an A. She wants everyone in the class to know everyone else so she gives a lot of group projects but they're pretty interesting projects.
