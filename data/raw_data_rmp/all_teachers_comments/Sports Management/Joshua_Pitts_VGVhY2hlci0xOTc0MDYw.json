Watch the wording of the quiz questions, there is attempts to trip you up. Offers a curve on any group of quizzes that the class average is below 70%. Definitely a doable class, just put forth effort and you'll do fine!\n","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjM5MjI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM4700","date_posted":"2024-04-12 04:55:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor ","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MTYxNDc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM4800","date_posted":"2021-05-05 15:16:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Pitts is fair, explains the math/formulas via Teams if online. Discussions are easy. However, when it comes to the exams, midterm and final---it's one of those if you get the first formula wrong, then the next 4 question are wrong. So on n' so forth. Better get the first question correct, or you're screwed.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzEwNjM4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM4800","date_posted":"2018-05-02 09:56:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pitts is hands down the best professor in the entire Sport Management department. Its very obvious that he loves what he does. He is passionate and very knowledgeable about the material he is teaching.

His tests can be challenging, but he gives you all the information you need to do well on them. He works out every assignment in class with you, so if you are in class you get a 100% for the assignment, really funny guy and a caring teacher. Definitely recommend him!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjIxMjUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Hilarious--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM4800","date_posted":"2016-08-02 12:56:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love Pitts! He is an amazing teacher and very helpful. If you ACTUALLY try in 4700 and 4800 you will be fine. He allows you to work in groups with is the best part! He usually go over assignments in class. He provides \"extra practice\" for the test, ONLY if you ask for them.... you're welcome.

He is really eccentric and excited about economics and finance!

He is very helpful when you need it. If you don't go to his class you'll fail. His provides his power points and assignments. Assignments can be worked in groups, which is amazing! You'll enjoy him, even though we don't have much teachers to choose from - he's the ONLY ONE! Good pick though.
