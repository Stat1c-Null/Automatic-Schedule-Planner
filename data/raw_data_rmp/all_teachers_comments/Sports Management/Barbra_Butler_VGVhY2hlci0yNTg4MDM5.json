No tests just quizzes that are webcam BUT theyre super easy and most are common sense. Overall shes a great professor and I recommend","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTQzODEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM3800","date_posted":"2020-12-06 00:47:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"What she makes you write about doesnt make sense. Let us write about any sport documentary and said we didnt need approval. Said my content wasnt directly related to what we learned in class? Everything else was apparently perfect but that gave me a 70? Dont take an online class. Doesnt communicate. Online course page is cluttered.

The lecture videos were so monotone and I couldn't pay attention. This professor is great and very organized but I don't think she realizes how specific her quiz questions were and how we can't be expected to memorize details from reading the book. Quizzes were lockdown w camera.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTE4Mjcw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SM2100","date_posted":"2020-07-13 21:33:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's very helpful! I took this class online. She did an excellent job providing the material in a very efficient and organized manner. Quizzes are easy, as long as you study the material. An easy grader and fair!!

Her lectures can be quite boring because she reads directly from the powerpoint. WORD FOR WORD. But, aside from that, there was a group project and volunteer hours. She is a very nice woman. I would recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjI3MDc1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM3300","date_posted":"2020-04-28 16:19:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Butler handled classes moving online due to COVID-19 better than I could have imagined.

She does require a minimum of 10 volunteer hours which I planned on using for the Final Four (Before COVID).
