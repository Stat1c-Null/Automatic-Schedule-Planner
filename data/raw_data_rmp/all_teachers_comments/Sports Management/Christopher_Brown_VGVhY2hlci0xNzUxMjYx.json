His tests can be challenging, but he tells you this. If you come to class and read the book as well as take notes, you will pass the tests fine. The semester plan is laid out in the beginning and he follows accordingly. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Mjk2NDk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM3100","date_posted":"2017-05-08 08:41:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Brown is flat out awesome. I enjoyed coming to his class everyday. He engages the students and makes lectures extremely enjoyable and interactive. He is passionate about what he does and make learning fun.

He grades fairly and as long as you are putting in the effort you will make the grade.

Great professor,  loves to joke around. He is an easy grader for the most part. When he says tests are 50% book and 50% notes - he means it! Used 2 books for this class. I'm not sure if you can get away with not buying the books. I recommend at least renting them. In class tests.

He is keeps it simple and teaches you everything you need to know for the work world after college. Very involved in the industry and very knowledgeable.

Probably exactly what a professor should be in college. Clear notes, very helpful, and tough tests. You have to be committed to make an A, but you will get a B as long as you try in the class.

One of my favorite thus far at KSU! First day came off kind of strict, but as long as you do what your supposed to do and show respect you wont have any problems.
