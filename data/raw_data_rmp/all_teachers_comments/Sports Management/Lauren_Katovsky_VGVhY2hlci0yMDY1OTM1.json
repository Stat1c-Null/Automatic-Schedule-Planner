One event paper and one group project. Really good at helping out with opportunities for internships/jobs/volunteer/etc to help build up your resume.

If you want a B, show up to class. If you want an A, read the book. Tests were online and very fair. Attend the guest lectures--some test questions come from them. No homework, but a few short assignments. Easy-going professor, would take again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NDIxNzIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
