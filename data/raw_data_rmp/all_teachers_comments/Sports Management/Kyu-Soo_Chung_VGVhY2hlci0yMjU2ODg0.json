No final exam or midterm, you write introductory and reflective essays with prompts at the beginning and end of the semester that were far more valuable than any test. 1 Quiz & 1 Discussion Post weekly, with a intro video posted weekly. Highly recommend!!!

Only issue I have is his lecture style. His lectures are often boring and he talks about most topics like he isn't too sure about what he's teaching. Half of the final grade comes from in class discussions, so attendance matters. Overall, an easy A, just not a great lecturer.

His grading criteria is very particular. Also hes a boring &amp; monotone lecturer so do not take him early in the morning.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1ODYzMDg4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
