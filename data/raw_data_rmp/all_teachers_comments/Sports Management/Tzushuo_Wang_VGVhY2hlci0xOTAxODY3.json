More like \"Marketing\" and had to buy HIS specific $70 book. Literally quiz, discussion, and 'classwork' every week, some worksheets were so nonsensical almost the entire class messed it up. Discussions are usually easy, but the tests and quizzes are hard. Professor is foreign and has BAD ENGLISH. Highlight in the book.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzE5OTMw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM3500","date_posted":"2014-07-21 21:54:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took his Summer class. Professor Wang  incredibly helpful and a really cool guy. He always relates the content to current events and is very interested in student's ideas. The quizzes were not too bad and the final was easy. He does discussion boards, a quiz, and an activity every week. Follow instructions and read your book and it'll be a breeze","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDYxOTA1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM2100","date_posted":"2014-05-15 09:04:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very helpful and interesting, I loved going to his class daily, because I learned so much and only ONE exam and its the final.
