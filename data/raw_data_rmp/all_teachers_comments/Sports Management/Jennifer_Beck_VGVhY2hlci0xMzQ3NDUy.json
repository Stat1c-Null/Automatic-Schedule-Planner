As long as you show up and take half decent notes you will pass no problem. Short tests that are not complicated. I have gotten an A on everything. If you need help, she is willing. Fun classes overall. She gives you a good thorough study guide for each test. Easy class work grades.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTE1NjQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS2100","date_posted":"2013-08-17 13:14:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"The test is are on things that you should have learned but she really never explains what you need to know","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMDYxNjgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS2220","date_posted":"2013-04-27 14:54:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tough but fair. She is very helpful to students, but won't hold your hand. Tests can be tough, especially the first one, but they are fair.

This class is very easy and interesting. The study guides are the same as the tests. Can miss up to 5 days unexcused but I never missed one. She is very approachable.
