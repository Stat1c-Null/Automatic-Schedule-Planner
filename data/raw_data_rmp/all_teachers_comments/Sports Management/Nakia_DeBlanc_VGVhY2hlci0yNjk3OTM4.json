At the beginning of each week, she'd post a video full of assignment/quiz reminders. Additionally, the few time I did email her, she responded immediately. This course could seem workload heavy, but if you stay on top of the work, you'll do fine!

Likely would have a much lower grade if it wasn't for the extra credit. Not doing too well on the assignments, projects, or quizzes, it is still possible to get an A because of the amount of volunteer extra credit. She gave me an extra chance to complete an assignment from a 0% to a high B","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODI4ODc5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM2100","date_posted":"2023-07-07 20:34:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is an amazing professor!!!

At the beginning of the semester, she goes over the entire course and her expectations. She does not put up with late work but is willing to help you.

She's been my favorite teacher at KSU so far. She truly cares about her students and their future success. She makes class fun and interesting and doesn't do a typical lecture like most other teachers. She makes class very interactive and is open for lots of discussions.
