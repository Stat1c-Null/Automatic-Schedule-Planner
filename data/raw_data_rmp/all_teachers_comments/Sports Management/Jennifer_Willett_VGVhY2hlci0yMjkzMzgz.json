She had daily quizzes, attendance was strongly encouraged (certain situations were ok to miss), and she had us do a mock trial. She made this class as chill and educational as it could possibly be. I am not very studious by any means, but this class was very doable. Highly recommend taking it if offered.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODc2MTI3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

She's a tough professor, tough grader. Instructions and syllabus are clear, not difficult assignments, just tedious and meticulous. Assignments were fun---I would take her classes in seat if had her again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTUwMjU3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM2400","date_posted":"2020-03-09 00:24:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"You'll have to take her since the department is too small. Doesn't seem to be fully qualified or invested in teaching the subject matter. Boringly reads straight from the powerpoint. Gives a lot of assignments in addition to semester long project and test. It's not overly difficult, but far too time consuming for how little you learn.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTYwMTU2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SM2400","date_posted":"2018-12-11 00:19:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed this class. I learned so much throughout this semester. This class is not easy at all, but with studying and doing the study guides and taking notes, an A is achievable.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTU3OTAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SM2100","date_posted":"2018-11-17 11:32:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Willett is such a great professor. Everything in her class is very clear cut and you are made aware of what is expected of you. However, if you are the least bit interested in sports, you will enjoy this class. All the topics covered are very relatable and a lot of fun.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzQ3MTQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
