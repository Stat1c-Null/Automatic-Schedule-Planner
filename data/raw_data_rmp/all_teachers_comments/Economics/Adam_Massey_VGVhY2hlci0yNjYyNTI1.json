He has three projects that determine your entire grade. His classes are basically learning the functionality of Excel and following him along. He is willing to answer the same question multiple times in a row, but after a while he starts to get upset. Overall easy class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTIyMTE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2022-05-10 02:10:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"He no longer plans on being a professor but just in case I am leaving a review. I had some basic experience with excel and got a 100% in App Stat through paying attention in class. You can work with others as long as you all do your own work. Very cool guy. If he ever teaches again make sure to take him if you can. You will not regret it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjkzMTQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2022-05-10 01:56:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"The whole class is done on excel, and is an easy 100% if you know the basics of excel. Graded by 3 things, but he gives examples and class time to ask as many questions as you need. Really quick to grade as well. 100% would take again.
