However, he really needs to work on his teaching method. Very vague answers to questions and relies heavily on the textbook that confuses more than teaches you.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTk2ODgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--Tests are tough","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECON2100","date_posted":"2017-11-10 19:07:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Britt has to be one of the worst professors at Kennesaw, If you have any questions on the material being &quot;taught&quot; in class he will avoid the question and then tell you to just read the book.

He's a nice man but a horrible professor. He goes off on tangents and never teaches. He'll teach a problem but will get the wrong answer and ask the students for help on how to get the problem right.
