He gives out 2 extra credit opportunities. The exam and quizzes were no lock down, and there was no webcam. He was easy and responded quickly to emails.

No homework, 6 quizzes (one of the quizzes is dropped), and a final. Do good on the quizzes and you can't fail the final. He also offers extra credit for showing up to additional sessions and making an effort to always attend class. Really chill and a great guy who will help you if asked.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDQ2MTcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2016","date_posted":"2022-11-22 03:05:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Slade's class is lecture-heavy with no homework. His lectures go over everything that needs to be learned with opportunities for extra credit but submit the slides a week or two after they were presented, meaning that if a lecture was missed and it will take a while before the missed information is learned. Fun class that does not ask for too much.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODc4MzMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Amazing lectures --Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2016","date_posted":"2022-11-18 17:09:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lectures are easy to understand, makes notes available in D2L after class, and gives plenty of opportunities for extra cred.

Harsh grader and needs to relax testing standards. Students want to know what they missed on their exams so you shouldn't keep the submitted exam from other students. I think you'd need to worry more about students understanding the material instead of worrying if they're gonna cheat.
