One of those classes that you can't jut breeze through. The material is tough, no matter what. You have to attend every day because everything builds on itself.

More than half of the class either received an F or D. The subject is hard no matter what. She is a nice woman, but I don't recommend her to anyone if you don't like to attend classes.
