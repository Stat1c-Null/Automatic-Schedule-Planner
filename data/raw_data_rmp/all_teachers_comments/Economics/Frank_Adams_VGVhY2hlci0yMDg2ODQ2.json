I filled out a survey for extra credit and he did not apply so i could get above the threshold, he really doesnt uphold his word and his lectures are mundane at best, dont take his course.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjY4NTU3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECON1100","date_posted":"2016-05-06 20:09:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Adams is a funny, knowledgeable professor who makes his lectures fun! Has 3 tests, but drops lowest grade, and a final. He will put an off the wall random question that he will tell those who attend class on exams, so be sure to attend class. His tests are easy if you read and try hard. Pretty easy A if you put in the work!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDkzOTEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON1101","date_posted":"2016-04-20 16:55:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Goes on tangents for the entire class and is not very good at explaining anything.

He drops the lowest, but it still means that there's a lot riding on those tests. Not very good at teaching. You mostly have to teach yourself using the textbook. Attendance is not necessary, but if you skip you could miss out on the answer to a random question that he adds to the test.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzM3NjA3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON1100","date_posted":"2016-04-15 10:15:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Adams is a really nice guy who knows a lot about economics. His tests are hard and you really have to study and listen well in class. No attendance but he makes up gimme test questions during random classes. 4 tests, one gets dropped and non-cumulative final.

However, I often go into the tests confident, come out nervous, but he curves the tests as well. Plus you only need an 86 in the class to make an A!

A total of 4 tests (including Final), drops lowest test grade (excluding final). Really nice guy and clear to understand. Willing to re-explain material multiple times to make sure everyone gets it.
