He doesn't take attendance and you don't need the textbook, how more easy does it need to be lol. I recommend you show up though because he'll be the chillest prof you've ever had","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDMxNDE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Would take again","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON1000","date_posted":"2017-12-07 14:01:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gets a lot of hate, but the class is actually fairly easy if you read the textbook and do the practice exercises. His lectures are informative (and funny, if you like gloomy humor). There are only three tests and very little extra credit, but if you do the work the tests aren't hard. Be sure to ask him for which chapters to read before lecture.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDgxNjk3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"Tests?
