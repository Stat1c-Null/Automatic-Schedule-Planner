There are 3 tests that make up your whole grade... if you do poorly on one it is very hard to get an A. You have to focus on the questions in the back of the textbook and his previous tests he releases to do well (on the first two tests). The last test (final exam) was very hard for some reason.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzA4OTI3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"D+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--EXTRA CREDIT--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECON1000","date_posted":"2018-11-12 15:35:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class is is easy when looking back on it.
