He only has 4 exams, no final, and they are the only things that are graded. Exams are taken online with no lockdown browser, so it makes it convenient to take exams wherever I might be. Presentations are clean and concise and Zach is overall a very good guy to be around. Take this class.

It didn't help that there weren't any tutors for Microeconomics that I could ask for help. The stress of being unable to understand the cluttered PowerPoints got so bad that I became physically sick and was forced to withdraw from the class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTI0OTc2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2106","date_posted":"2025-04-21 21:44:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was one of the best professors I have had ever. He was super caring and was not rude AT ALL. The class was fairly easy. This class has 4 exams and no final. The material he taught was on the tests, no surprises when taking them. I would take this professor again if I could!

This class is nice because he does not expect a lot from you which has helped make my semester workload so much better and has allowed me to focus on my harder classes. His book is a worthy read too, and is short but also extra credit points. Very great guy and I'm appreciative","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODkyNjQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Amazing lectures --Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
