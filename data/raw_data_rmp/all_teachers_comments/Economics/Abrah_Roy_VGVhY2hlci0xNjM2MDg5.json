His lectures were boring and he did not seem to care about his students. Ask him a question during the review days and he will make them seem dummy proof. He goes through a question in about 20-40 seconds during review days and for most business majors, this is your first econ class.

Most of the content was a repeat for me from previous ECON, so attending all lectures gave me an easy A. Attendance is not mandatory and even though he recommends the book, didn't open it all semester.

He does give study guides but has nothing to do with the test or even relates to what is on the test. His test were incrediblley hard but he did curve them and people would end up with a 71 even with the curve. That should show how hard the class was. He made the class harder than it should have been.

His first test is impossibly hard. Best score before massive curve was a 71. Second test was simple after seeing his grading method.

He expects you to have studied before the class and especially the tests. He gives you practice tests for all the exams. If you struggle in this subject don't take his class.
