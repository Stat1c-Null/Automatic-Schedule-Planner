Unfortunately he just talked at us each class and it was rather boring unless you are really interested in economics or a major. Tests were difficult and the average was always below 70...He was content with our scores.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzEzNzgz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2300","date_posted":"2012-04-11 09:52:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor! He is very encouraging although his style of teaching was initially difficult for me. The material is not easy to grasp and I struggled the first month but Prof Robinson never gave up on me. I made a very high A by the end of the semester! Just study his notes thoroughly and it's a straight A!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDI5NTg0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2100","date_posted":"2012-04-09 14:59:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome teacher, made me want to major in economics. I really enjoyed his teaching style and overall is one of the best professors I've had so far at KSU.

Made A's in other Econ classes. Not sure if its his style of teaching or what. The way he explains concepts is difficult to understand. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU WANT A GOOD GRADE!!!

But all he does is lectures from powerpoints. He provides long chapter summaries and does not give out powerpoints. Tests are extremely difficult made D's and  lower and he curves very minimal. Had to withdraw from his class. Not worth it. I don't think i would take him again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5ODg5Njc0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
