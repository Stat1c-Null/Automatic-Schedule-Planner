Notes are online but he clarifies them in class. Previous tests are online. You can keep your test after you take it and then the next class will focus on reviewing it. THe lowest is dropped.

He posts previous tests online for all to see, gives notes online (but still adds onto them in class), and is a nice person. However, the work is pretty hard.
