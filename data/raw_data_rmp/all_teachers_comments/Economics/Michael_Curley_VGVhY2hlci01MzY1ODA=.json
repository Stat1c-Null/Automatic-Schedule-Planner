He is a very boring professor, but he knows what he is talking about. If you ask him a question he will explain it well. I would take him again. Know the book & the powerpoints going into the test. Curves apx 10 points per test. Grade based on 4 tests (drops lowest) and the final. Not bad","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDYwNDU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2100","date_posted":"2012-12-10 08:34:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Horrible! This class is ridiculous...forget the fact that it's boring and focus on the fact that he does not try to teach those who don't understand. He says if you have a question post it on discussion and see if someone a classmate will explain it. Unless u need a class that doesn't require teaching take it!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDA0Nzgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"A01","date_posted":"2012-10-03 20:57:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"So boring. everything he goes over the in class isn't even on the exam.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNjc3ODUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2100","date_posted":"2012-05-09 18:04:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Second time taking econ and it was even more difficult. Rambles and lectures the whole time. Your better off not going to class and learning the material yourself. Gives open note test but doesn't help much. He may curve test depending on class performance. If you want to learn anything stay away from this professor b/c he doesnt know how to teach.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjQyMjk1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2200","date_posted":"2012-05-09 17:52:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is incredibly dull and boring, I like Econ, but this class was a drag. He tries to be nice though, lets you use notes on the test and gives extra credit. But if you're looking for an exciting, fun-filled, thrilling economics class, this is not the professor for you.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjQyMTY1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2200","date_posted":"2012-04-11 13:50:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Beware. Thankfully the exams are open note and the final is optional. He curves all of the exams, but his lectures are not worth going to. He will only further confuse you. Read the textbook word for word like the Bible and you will do fine on exams. If you have other options for a professor, take them.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDMxMDY5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2100","date_posted":"2012-02-09 11:39:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very smart, but should not be teaching. He is literally the most confusing and unclear speaker. He doesn't even tell you where you are starting so you can follow along. Tests are extremely difficult and complicated.
