He can't hear past the first row, and his voice won't carry past the second. He dodges questions because he doesn't know, and often asks students to solve problems for him so he doesn't look clueless. you'll be teaching yourself.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODQ4NTUx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECON2100","date_posted":"2017-10-17 15:37:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! Four tests and those are your only grades in the class; drops lowest test grade. No study guides. Whole class based off of the book, but tests are nothing like the material in the book. Lectures are pointless to go to. Might as well have taken an online class because you are really teaching yourself all of the material..","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NzUyMjE1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
