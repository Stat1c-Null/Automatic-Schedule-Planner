The textbook is very important in this course. Therefore, make sure you read related chapters (including end of each chapter) and understand the concepts. His voice is low, so, make sure you sit close to him. Overall, a very nice and helpful professor.

Required that you read the text prior to class (nothing wrong with that), however, in class all he did is simply repeat, nearly verbatim, the reading.
