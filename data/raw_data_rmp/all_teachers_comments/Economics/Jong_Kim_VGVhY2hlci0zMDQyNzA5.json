You just have to work with the language barrier and piece together what he's trying to say. It was fustrating to deal with tbh. Exams are open notes and simple questions. He's a good guy and very nice and does his best to help you. There is a lot of extra credit which I appreciated.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjM4MjU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Econ3300","date_posted":"2025-05-10 19:18:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Kim is such a sweet man but his style of teaching left me very fustrated the entire semester. This was a really easy class, but idk if I'd want to go through it again. It's better if you don't ask questions because he'll either say you're overthinking or leave you more confused. He did ramp up the extra credit towards the end of the sem.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjM4MjA3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Econ3300","date_posted":"2025-05-01 02:36:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Kim is nice and understanding! He will try to explain a specific concept if you need help. He has a strong accent so pay attention during the lectures. ATTEND CLASS! He does pop quizzes for extra credit so trust me, you want to earn the most points possible. Do your best on the homework as well. Exams were open notes.

He has \"broken English,\" but if you go to every class and mostly pay attention, this class is an easy A. He takes attendance occasionally for a grade and extra credit twice a month, adding 5 extra points to tests each. Not too much homework; if you go to class and study for exams, you'll get an A.

He does have a relatively strong Korean accent, and going to class is necessary, but he can be tough to understand.
