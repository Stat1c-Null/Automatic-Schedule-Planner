I hate econ, but got an A in the class and actually enjoyed it. If you have an A after the 3rd exam (or are satisfied with grade) you don't have to come back to class. Study guides are the exams almost word for word. All multiple choice.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTI4MjA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON1100","date_posted":"2015-12-08 09:29:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easiest professor ever! Attendance isn't mandatory and he drops your lowest test grade. He puts all his slides and a study guide for every test on D2L. The test questions are taken directly from the study guide. I went to class maybe twice tops per unit, studied the study guides, and still got a 90, a 92, and a 98 on the first three tests.

Extremely easy. I never went to class except for test days. Didn't study for the first 2 tests (78 and 65) but made flash cards from his study guide for the last exam and studied for maybe 3 hours and got a 95 and still ended the class with a B.

By far the most easiest class I had . Class is optional. No attendance policy . He posts all slides to d2l & gives study guides. I didn't go to class when I didn't feel like it .

There are 4 exams, and he counts the highest 3. They are taken straight from the slides - no textbook required. I mean I got 100 on 23 of the exams and didn't crack it. He posts all slides to D2L.

He provides you with several extra credit opportunities (I think we had 3 total). But you have to be IN CLASS to get the points! I only used the book to study for exams.

It took me until the 3rd test to get an A on one, but I ended up with an A in the class. Class is optional, he even says that at the beginning. You take 4 tests and he drops the lowest one.
