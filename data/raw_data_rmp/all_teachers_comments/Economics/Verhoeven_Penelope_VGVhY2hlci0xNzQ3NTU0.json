If it were not for all of the (minus 1's) on my test, I would have had an easy A. She makes you interpret test questions word for word or she will mark off. So this means you have to study extra hard. I, however, did not go to class and managed to pull an 89 before the final.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Njk1NDkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2015-03-30 14:35:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Penelope is a sweet lady who really tries her best to pass on the information of the course. The class is a tough one, but can be easily learned. She is a meticulous grader though. Can be an easy A if you do all the homework, attend every class, etc. The final exam is optional, so in theory, if you have an A after all three tests, you have an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTIwMjA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2300","date_posted":"2013-04-29 22:09:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awsome Professor.
