ONLY 3 tests, no other assignments. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you don't show up you won't understand the material as well. He goes through material fast sometimes so I was reliant on Youtube for most of it.

His lectures are hilarious and he tells stories that help you remember the content. If you don't go to class it's hard to pass because he doesn't use a book and the only grades are tests, but it's more than worth it to show up for the lectures.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjUyNzEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Attendance isn't mandatory and you can choose to buy the textbook and teach yourself. I didn't find his tests too hard, but some did. It really depends on how much you remember from high school econ.

You have 4 tests and THAT IS IT. If you approach him, he does not offer much help and always thinks that the material is &quot;easy&quot; and some people would feel stupid because he acts like you should know everything. Tests can be extremely difficult especially test 2.

He has great stories that really connect the material. There's no mandatory attendance and the only grades are 4 tests (Best of 3).
