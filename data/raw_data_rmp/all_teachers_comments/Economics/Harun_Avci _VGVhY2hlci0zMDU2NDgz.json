Quizzes are tough if you don't know what you're doing and the class its self is challenging. Lead off with a bad start so I left. Seems like a nice guy but not my favorite professor. I would say show up and try to pay attention but I went and looked away for 2 seconds and was entirely lost for the rest of class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjYxMDA4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2025-08-27 13:01:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best Professor I've ever had at KSU! He's very straightforward on what to expect and you have to attend class to pass. Very good at answering questions. Excel projects can be challenging but it's that way for any instructor you take for this course. He will take all the time you need after class to answer your questions and is uncommonly kind.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjAzOTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Amazing lectures --Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2025-05-06 04:10:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Second semester teaching. Great professor, but for this class in general, show up to class! He gives extra credit pop quizzes throughout the semester which bumped me to the A in the end. 2 tests, 3 excel assignments, and like 10 quizzes. Work for the grade and show up to class and you'll do fine. He's a really great guy!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTczMjA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Beware of pop quizzes--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2024-12-13 17:11:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"It was my 2nd time taking this class and I passed with a B. He was way better than my first econ teacher. Show up to class and take good notes (he lets you use your notes on the test) He gives out random pop quizzes throughout the semester which can only help your grade . Just show up to class and you will pass. Very easy excel assignments.

The tests are in person on a device (no lockdown/webcam). Good luck learning anything though. He was a 1st year teacher so he possibly could change his strategy next semester. Gives EC but its like 1% of your grade. Don't pair with finance PLEASE.
