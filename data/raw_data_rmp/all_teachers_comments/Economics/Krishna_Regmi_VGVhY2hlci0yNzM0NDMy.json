Not because of the course content, but due to the levels of stress endured while trying to comprehend it. Make no mistake, Professor Remgi is a great guy and you can see that he has good intentions. But for the purpose of having the ideal experience, I wouldn't recommend taking him.

He graded homework with a microscope. His lectures were nonsensical and he did not try to help us understand until Unit 3. His accent is thick and hard to understand as well. Maybe he should teach another class, because I can see he has potential as a professor, just not a stats professor. 0/10","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NDE5OTE1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2300","date_posted":"2022-05-08 23:45:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice person but horrible like really bad teacher so all i can say if you take this course and teacher is, Good Luck ill pray for ya cause you'll need it 100%!

One of my favorite classes so far. What I like the most about him is most of his work is pen and paper, which is what I prefer over online learning systems. You only have a few online homework assignments which are easy. His practice tests really help. Recommend taking him if you want an in depth learning experience of stats.

He has both online HW (5 question MC) and in-person HW (only takes 3 or 4 to grade) and 3 tests including final.

His accent also makes learning difficult. Tests make up most of grades, and he did let you redo them to gain back 1/2 of the points missed, but that didn't really help, since you have to get it right on the re-do and you still don't have a clue.
