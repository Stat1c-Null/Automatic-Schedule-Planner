You won't learn a thing. His quiz and test questions are based on his opinions, most of which contradict each other. He's never clear about what the point of his sentence is.

He doesn't know what he's talking about. Getting a good grade is somewhat doable in the first half if you can manage to understand the quiz questions from the lectures from some other dude.

He requires attendance but in class lecturers last 20 minutes, if that. The material he goes over in class has absolutely nothing to do with what we are learning.

We had a hybrid class and he just rambled about irrelevant things and couldn't finish a thought.
