I was supposed to graduate the semester I took him and could not because he gave me a D.  Not sure how I got a D he never returned the second exam grade so he could have made it up for all I know.  He barely speaks english so good luck understanding him.

Econ is not my thing but he's an amazing teacher. Gives 15pt take home extra credit pts on tests--which are open note, open book, and exactly what's on the review he gives out for the exam.
