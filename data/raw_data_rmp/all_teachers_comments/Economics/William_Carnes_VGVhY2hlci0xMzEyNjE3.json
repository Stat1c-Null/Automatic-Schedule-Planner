I'm pretty sure i slept through almost every class, hard to pay attention. He just reads off a powerpoint. His tests are confusing so take your time and read the chapters beforehand. Does drop lowest test and quiz grade.

He is willing to help, relates real world experience to class topics, and his tests are straight-forward. However, you must go to class and turn-in the homework.
