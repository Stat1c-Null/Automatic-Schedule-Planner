He was incredibly disorganized, not updating questions to align with the new addition of the book. The due dates on many assignments were incorrect. Doesn't answer emails. It's obvious that most of his content has been stolen from another professor. One of the worst online classes I've ever taken.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTg0MTY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2024-04-26 15:44:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would absolutely recommend taking Professor Kahn! His lectures are pretty easy to understand however he does not give homework and or any extra assignments so our grade is based on three exams so make sure to be there for lectures. If you have any questions be sure to ask him, he's very nice about helping students understand the materials!

Final is optional but you can take the final and replace the lowest grade from the 3 exams. He is very entertaining and will answer any questions you have. You dont have to go to class but I would recommend it. He has practice problems on D2L for you but those are optional.
