I personally did not feel like a learn something during his course and this is a subject I was interested on learning. Everything we had were videos reading slides and that's it. I wish this was more dynamic than just a grade to submit.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Njc3NTcw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2200","date_posted":"2017-08-01 10:41:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hariharan limits himself to read the PowerPoint slides. He barely explains the graphs. His exams are difficult, dont have anything to do with the reviews. He mentioned the formulas the class before the exam! Be careful and review your tests, he makes mistakes grading  them. Nice person but doesnt know how to teach.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTc0MzMz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECON2100","date_posted":"2015-08-11 23:51:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"He only gives 4 exams, at least for summer session. The lowest exam grade is dropped and theyre all weighted equally. I should have failed this class based on the grades I got, but I went to his office 2 or 3 times and I studied like crazy and went over practice exams with him so he saw my effort and just wanted me to pass so I got a C.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MTEzMTQ3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON8010","date_posted":"2005-06-06 12:10:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hariharan is really nice. His class is very interesting and useful. There is no group project. You need to do all the homeworks and take home exams your own.  I really learned a lot from this class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjY3Nzk=","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON8010","date_posted":"2005-05-12 08:13:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good Economics class.
