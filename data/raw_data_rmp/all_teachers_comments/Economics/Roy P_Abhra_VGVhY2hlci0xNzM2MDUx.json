There are no resources besides what he draws on the board. If you do badly on one test, you are screwed for the rest of the semester. Most people dropped mine so ruined chance of curve. Ask him questions and he will look at you like you are stupid. He will fail you with no remorse.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjM1MDUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON4410","date_posted":"2013-12-04 14:17:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is an incredibly smart man who is extremely passionate about economics. That being said... if you are not genuinely interested in the material, do not take this course. It is hard, but passable... go to class and review sessions and you will get an A... miss class/ forget to take notes, and you will fail.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDMyMzE0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2100","date_posted":"2013-04-22 03:40:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"There were 3 or so exams, all graded on a curve. Material is fairly easy to pick up if you only use the book, but if you go to class and take good notes and study from his provided sample tests, you should make an A. Attendance was not mandatory. Just don't be late or use your phone or talk at all, because he will make a scene.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTc2NjAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MICROECONOMICS","date_posted":"2013-04-14 22:34:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"I went to maybe 3 classes and passed with a 98. He puts sample tests online for each unit. The sample tests pretty much follow the graded tests. All I did was go over the sample tests and took notes on each chapter that we needed to know. No need to attend as long as you can teach yourself from the book. Pretty easy stuff.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTM0ODA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2200","date_posted":"2012-11-12 12:18:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was very arrogant.
