You just have to read the slides he posts online and put in minimal effort to get an A in this class. Easiest professor Ive had all semester.

There are also 10 points of extra credit available on your final grade for those attending class. I highly recommend going to class and doing the practice questions in the book to get an A.

However, he takes ECON1000 WAY too seriously, and I had to study way harder than anyone else I knew taking the same class with different professors. He only lectures, and attendance is optional (besides test days). 3 tests make up the entire grade, with 5 bonus quizzes for EC.
