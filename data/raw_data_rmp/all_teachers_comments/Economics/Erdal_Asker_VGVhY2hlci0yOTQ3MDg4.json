Can stumble over his words and teaching style can get people confused sometimes, but if you pay attention to his lectures, you will be okay. First two tests are easy, last one is hard since cumulative. Be sure to study and do your homework or you can fall behind.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTMyNTgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2024-01-22 18:48:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst class I've taken at KSU, went everyday and still failed! He had no idea what he was teaching and couldn't solve a problem himself without looking at his notes. When asking for help he just told us to do it ourselves and laughed. Reported him to the Dean multiple times. KSU please hire teachers who know what they're teaching, AVOID HIS CLASS!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTExNDEw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2024-01-08 17:32:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"The professor is always willing to help whenever you need it. If you find yourself struggling, take advantage of his office hours, he is more than open-minded and willing to extend them to any student. At the end of the day this is not an easy course, so go in ready to take notes and absorb all of the information. Very linear course","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODQ4MjY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON3300","date_posted":"2023-12-22 17:36:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is super nice, but not a great teacher. There is so much material to learn for this class and he does not teach it very clearly. You do get a note card on the tests (2 tests and a final), and there is weekly homework to help with your grade. He does give partial credit on some things just for trying. I would take another professor if possible.
