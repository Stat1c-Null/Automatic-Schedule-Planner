She made Econ 3300 very easy to understand where other teachers make it impossible. Her grading criteria are straight forward. All the information you need is gives in class and optional homework and extra credit is available. The Worlds best teacher!

She adjusts the material if her class needs to move slower or faster. 3 tests and a final, only the top 3 test grades count. Group project that is super easy. Strongly suggests. Knows what she is talking about. Gives hand outs, and practice tests. Test are basically the practice tests.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzkyNTIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2300","date_posted":"2016-04-15 11:30:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher.

Makes a hard subject seem easy and her teaching methods are clearly geared to the current generation of students. Extremely nice and understanding. She grades a bit harshly but the tests are very fair and she lets you take the final as an option to drop the lowest test grade. Probably the best App Stat professor at Kennesaw.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTQxMjM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
