Provides extra credit(5 lectures at an event on campus), however, it's not fair to those who can't make it to every event, b/c it can interfere with other classes. Plus getting 1 point from 50-minute lectures don't seem worth it to miss another class.

There were some additional readings, but they were entertaining and informative. If you apply yourself, it should be an easy A. Some students have written harsh reviews in the past, but I have not experienced any of the complaints.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjkyNjM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECONOMICS1000","date_posted":"2023-11-27 20:42:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"his exams are so difficult the amount of terms you have to learn are between 118-230 and you have to use both your text book and economics in one lesson textbook.

The thing I disliked most about this professor is that he did not like interrupting himself to answer student's questions on the spot. However he does give lots of extra credit. His tests are difficult and the questions are very random.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Mzg1MTI4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECONOMICS1000","date_posted":"2023-01-09 01:24:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is all around good at his job, he likes to talk a LOT so prepare to listen to (in my opinion) an unnecessarily long lecture. He does extra credit (go to guest lectures) which is cool, and he doesn't use the lock-down browser (he'll know if you cheat btw).
