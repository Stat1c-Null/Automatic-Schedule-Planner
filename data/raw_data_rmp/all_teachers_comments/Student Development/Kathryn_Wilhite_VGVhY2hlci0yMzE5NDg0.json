Her class is discussion based with no tests or quizzes but do not miss any assignment or your grade will tank. She believes in school being your first priority and doesn't stray far from the rubrics the Honor's College gives her","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTc5NDY5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--Skip class?

She genuinely loves what she does and wants to help you more than anything. There are no quizzes or tests, and the homework is between 4 to 10 subjective questions. As long as you participate in discussion you'll be one of her favorites. I could not recommend her more.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzM0OTA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-11-10 22:19:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super easy and chill teacher.

She actually cares about her students, and she cares about how everything we learn in class will fit into our lives. She will work with you on anything if you are having trouble and make sure you understand the content. There are no tests. Just a paper, an infographic, a vision plan, and weekly readings.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjc0Njkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSUSEMHON1101","date_posted":"2018-11-06 17:49:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"The greatest teacher you can have first semester of college.

We had homework assignments fairly regularly, but I learned something from each and every one of them. She really cares about her students and formed a personal relationship with every one of us.
