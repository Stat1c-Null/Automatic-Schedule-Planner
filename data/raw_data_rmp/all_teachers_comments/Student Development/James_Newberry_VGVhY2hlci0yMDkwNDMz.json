The problem is when he gets carried away with his self importance and belittles others. He is not well suited to classroom instruction, with his condescending attitude, but can be tolerated if you take him with a grain of salt.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODM5NTc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2016-05-03 12:17:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Newberry is sassy as hell but I enjoyed it. None of his assignments are difficult at all. The hardest assignment was a community service project that we had to do.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDQ4OTU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2015-12-18 02:22:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall the assignments are pretty clear. His attitude and personality can range from friendly to very sassy and pointed, so I would recommend staying on his good side. If you work hard in the class, keep up with assignments, participate in lectures, and show up to class you're bound to get an A. He gets annoyed very easily, so beware.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NzU2MjYy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
