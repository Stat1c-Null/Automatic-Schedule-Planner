You will probably get out of class 30 to 40 minutes early most class days. And he gives out a lot of extra credit to those who show up on days with low attendance.

Take his class if you don't really care about your required freshman class. Two test. STUDY WHAT HE TELLS YOU. A couple projects/papers, but they are very easy and he grades them very easily. Fun class. Lots of discussions. Probably the best guy to take for a seminar cause i've heard that the others are lots of work!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjc5ODUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2013-07-17 00:19:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely funny and laid back.

He is extremely laid back and funny. This was by far the easiest class of my semester. there is very little work except studying a little bit for the tests which were easy. There is one group project and a couple other outside class assignments that are simple but definitely get him if you can!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODgxMTM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1100","date_posted":"2012-11-14 14:48:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love this man. He's so funny and laid back. Definitely try to get his class. Even though they are evening classes, they are well worth it. The only trap is, he doesn't remind you of the extra activities to do outside of class so you can't forget about those or your grade will drop tremendously. If you can, take him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODM0MjE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2012-08-20 21:49:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy is probably the most laid back professor ever!

It's a freshmen seminar class, calm down. We always got to leave 45 minutes early, and study guides told you exactly what was gonna be on test. His bonus questions are totally pointless though...
