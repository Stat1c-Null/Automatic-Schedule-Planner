One negative is he is a pretty slow grader and his syllabus isn't accurate to what really happens.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3OTQzODM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2023-05-15 02:17:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nicolas Sillitti is extremely caring and really does want his students to succeed both in his class and elsewhere. The assignments were all very open ended, which I really appreciated as a gen-ed. Only complaint is he's quite disorganized. Slow grader, slow to respond to emails, and we didn't even end up doing half the things on the schedule.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3OTIzNDM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2023-05-08 16:32:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Throughout the course he made it seem like it would be a stress-free class and if we ever had doubts \"email him\". We were supposed to have over 20 grades according to the syllabus, but by the end, it was only like 6 so your grade was heavily affected. He also would take almost a week to email back, and he said he'd take late work but put in a 0.

He's a really down-to-earth and funny guy, and he's a pleasure to be around. He really cares about his students. However, he can be a bit disorganized and scatterbrained, and he's a pretty slow grader. Grade was made up of 2 essays, a couple open-ended quizzes, and some reflections.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzY4Nzgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1107","date_posted":"2022-10-28 16:33:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very knowledgeable in what he teaches, and very passionate about it too. Grading is based on 4 essays that he gives you lots of time to do, resources that need to be included, and he's willing to help out as well. Lectures are mostly him talking with some group activities. Overall a great professor.
