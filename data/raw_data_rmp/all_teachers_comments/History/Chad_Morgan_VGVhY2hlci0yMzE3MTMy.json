All of his classes are pretty much lectures and he brings in some activities to get his students engaged. He liked to do class discussions and I felt it was really helpful since we had a pretty small class. Only 3 test grades, no extra credit. He gives you everything to study over so an A should be no problem.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTA2NDEy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2018-04-29 16:51:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"All around really chill dude. Really lax with attendance as long as you do well in the class. Really seems to care about what he teaches. Lectures are kind of boring but the tests are pretty easy- you get a whole week to study and usually know exactly what youll be tested on. Really easy to ask questions/talk to.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTI2NzYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--LECTURE HEAVY--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HISTORY","date_posted":"2018-04-22 21:54:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this as an 8AM classes and the lectures were not that fun to sit through, but he will be there for you! I got all As and barely did any work until last minute before test. He tells you exactly whatll be on the test and a week before and you can just study that.

You really don't even have to do the reading. The tests are super short and super easy. He's so nice. Kind of late on answering emails but he's very lenient on tests, attendance and everything else. Just be open with him, show up, study when the test reviews come out and you'll get an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njg0MjM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2017-12-11 07:40:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"There will be three tests, all have 5 short answers that are term identification and an essay that is very open-ended. I got all B's. Not a very hard class and prof morgan knows his stuff but the lectures are very very boring, there is nothing engaging about it at all. Also, our class was allowed a 3&quot;x5&quot; notecard on the tests including the final.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTI2Njc2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Tests?
