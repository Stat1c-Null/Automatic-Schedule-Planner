This semester it was 3 exams, multiple choice style with optional essay. 2 map quizzes that are really easy just memorize them. Final project is very open ended and at least is worth 15 percent but can be worth more.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDA2MTE4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2016-03-31 22:39:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor, young guy who really has a passion about history. Lectures run long but he is funny and makes them enjoyable most of the time. Tests are very difficult. They are multiple choice format with an optional essay portion. This class is not really one for the easy \"A\", but if you are interested in history I strongly recommend this prof.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjEzOTUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2016-03-28 09:27:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Swaine was a great professor to have for a pretty boring history course. He understands that very few people actually enjoy history, but tries to make it fun and relatable. Down to earth guy, gives specific feedback on what he expects. Lectures can be long but again he tries to make them interesting.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTkwNjE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2016-01-12 15:44:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super cool guy and really cares about what he teaches. There's a ton of reading though and his tests are super hard. There's a few papers but they aren't that bad. He likes straight to the point papers. He asks for feedback in class. He also made our final into anything of our choosing because he wanted us to pass.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTI3NDE3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2015-11-19 11:00:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Was my favorite professor this semester. I had him for an 8 am and he made my whole day. His test were difficult but once you figure out how to take them its an easy A. He doesn't want fluff in his papers, be to the point. He also cares about his students he gave everyone 10 points on a test that had a low average score. Best lectures very funny!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NDUwMzg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2015-11-17 10:07:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Interesting teacher that immediately responds to emails. Will help you write papers or study if you ask for help. Tests are very tough and require memorization. His class is lecture styled but he makes them very interesting. You will learn a lot from this class but do not take him if you are not prepared to do the required reading and show up.

Asks input about tests and quizzes, and gives you a chance to ask questions the day before the test. The midterm is pretty straight forward if you study your notes and power points. However, he threw in another test halfway between the midterm and final that was a lot harder. MEMORIZE the material to be safe.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mzc2MDIw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2015-11-06 11:44:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a very good professor, but the tests are pretty hard. You are definitely going to have to work to pass his class. He is pretty young so he relates a lot of the material to modern day problems which helped me understand his lectures more.

Very positive, and very clear with his expectations. He's kind of old school; you have to go to class. The subject matter is pretty boring, but he knows what he's talking about.
