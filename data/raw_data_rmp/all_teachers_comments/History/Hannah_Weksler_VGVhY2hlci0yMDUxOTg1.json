She is a quirky, yet nice lady and she always is there for the students. I'm good at history, but I made C's on all of the tests. She offered bonus points each time, so I got lower B's. Made 100's on Participation and short responses and ended up with a rounded up 90. I would take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDc2MzU4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2016-02-05 11:49:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class was easy.

Her lectures are all over the place and it seemed hard for her to stay focused on the subject matter. The tests were straight forward if you paid attention, unfortunately I didn't because the lectures were extremely dull. You have to go to class every day. Gives terms to study before every test. Final isn't cumulative.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODI2NDQ3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2015-12-10 21:16:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Eh. Class was very boring overall. You don't HAVE to read. Her lectures cover most of the material well. For the typical student, you will get a high B or low A. She does give small extra credit oppurtunities. Overall, just a normal class.  Does give a daily participation grade.
