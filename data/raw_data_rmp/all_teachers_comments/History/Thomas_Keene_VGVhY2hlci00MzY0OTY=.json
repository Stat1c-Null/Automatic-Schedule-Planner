Amazing lecture skills and has a lot of passion! He could talk about grass growing and I wouldn't mind. Interesting assignments too. Definitely plan on taking him in the future!

He is one of the best professors at KSU, if not THE best. Some say his lectures are scattered, but I disagree. Dr. Keene \"connects the dots\" between different subjects.

He knows his stuff very well but lectures are not the most organized.  Make sure you attend any/all study sessions if available.
