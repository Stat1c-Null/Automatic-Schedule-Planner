Covered little to no material that friends did in their hist 2110 classes. Frustrating to listen to and attempt to take notes from his babbling.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjYwMzQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2011-05-06 12:00:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Hill def. knows everything about history.  However he will debate you on everything and never let you finish a sentance before he interupts you.  I had someone sign me in most of the time so i went like once every two weeks.  We took 2 test all semester and both were a joke.  Very Opinionated.  But a joke of a class easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTQyMDA2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2011-05-03 10:51:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Knows everything about history but is biased beyond words to his own opinions.  Disorganized, creepy, and wont let you finish a sentence.  Getting a decent grade is rather easy if you participate in class but you will have to be able to put up with his personality.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTE0MDcw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
