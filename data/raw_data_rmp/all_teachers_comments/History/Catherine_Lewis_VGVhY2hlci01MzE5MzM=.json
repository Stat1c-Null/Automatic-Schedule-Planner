She is an awesome woman and if you work hard you will get a good grade. Don't miss class (she knows me very well and would chew me out if I missed or was late) even for legitimate reasons.

Go to class without fail, READ AND KNOW THE ASSIGNMENTS, answer the questions you DO KNOW so she won't call on you when you don't know.  Don't procrastinate.  Get to the point on your presentations.  Get your papers proofread by the TA.  STUDY VERY HARD for the oral midterm.  After that it is a breeze.

One of the most awful classes I ever took was museum studies. Rather than studying museums (like the course description), we curated an entire exhibit from scratch. Too much work in too short of a period of time. Totally disorganized. Work was done by few, and slackers were ignored. Large part of the final grade was peer-review.
