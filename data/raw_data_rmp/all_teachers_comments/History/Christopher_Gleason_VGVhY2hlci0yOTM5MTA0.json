Reading homework daily, but I think most people don't read the textbook (which you can find online). Tests are 10 mc and an essay. He tells you the prompts beforehand and goes through what to write. Teaches through ppt, but take notes off what he says. Takes attendance, but no grade ","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MTI3NDAw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2024-01-11 02:04:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very passionate teacher, loves a good discussion. Make sure to participate in the discussions otherwise the lectures will get very boring. Make sure to take your own notes, his powerpoints are more like his note card to know what to talk about, and you wont be able to take photos of the notes on the board because his handwriting is bad.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODY1ODI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2023-12-21 17:27:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"4 1-page reading analysis due throughout the semester which are your only grades other than the 3 exams. Says he grades attendance but he never put the grade in so idk. Tests consist of an essay and a section of multiple choice, both to be completed in class time. Overall not a bad class, but I only found it useful to go the day before exams.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzY3NDIx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2023-12-15 22:29:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tests consist of in class essays. He's very passionate about material and made it enjoyable. Very in-class discussion heavy. READ THE TEXTBOOK. Although I didn't read every page, I definitely tried to skim through because he expects you to have read the material before coming to class. If you don't you'll be lost in lectures. Would take again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4Njk3MjQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2023-10-19 20:03:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a very nice person but his hand writing is almost impossible to read (like its BAD) and the powerpoints he makes are so vague. This class is very boring in my opinion and he doesn't do much to make it interesting. Attendance is mandatory. Tests include multiple choice and essay answers. You'll do fine if you're an auditory learner.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjkwNzMx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
