A very harsh grader on the assigned essays, and the critiques don't make sense. She requires you to use the sources she provides to, but many are outdated and don't even work.

But in all honesty you'll probably end up with an A.\nDon't watch the hour lectures she assigns, just ask AI to summarize it and use that. Same thing with the documents and literally everything in her class. I learned absolutely nothing and still got an A.

She doesn't create her own lectures, just utilizes other peoples stuff on youtube. She is extremely lazy and gave everyone in my class the same grade on the midterm. Didnt grade midterm until 2 days before grades we due and then accused me of AI on my final and my midterm 6 hours before grades we due....","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMzIxODU5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2024-12-11 02:58:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you're thinking about taking this professor&#8230;. don't!
