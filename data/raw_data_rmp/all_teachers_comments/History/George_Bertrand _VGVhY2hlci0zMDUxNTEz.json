Grades very hard and doesn't truly care if the student passes or fails. As a person he's a nice guy, but as a professor very harsh. Rambles in lectures that have nothing to do with the subject that we need to learn.

Made it confusing to get correct answers/clarification. Can't hear (will have to speak loud) and speaks at a slow pace. Kinda smug and isn't very engaging during lectures. 3 exams, no homework, and class participation matters. Don't take.

He'll push you to read the text book but some of the questions will hardly come from it. Majority of your grades will come from the 3 tests.

He believes study guides are for middle schoolers (which is bullshit) when other professors hand out study guides.
