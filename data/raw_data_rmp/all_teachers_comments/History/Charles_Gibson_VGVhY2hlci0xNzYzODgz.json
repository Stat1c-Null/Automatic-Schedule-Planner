Doesn't give out study guide for tests and questions come out of no where. Digresses in lectures and speeds at the end of class to get all material in. Not worth the struggle. You need a 75% for a C, 84% for B, 92% for A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDc3ODkw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2013-11-21 19:24:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"We teach ourselves in this class. He rants the entire period. Quiz every day. Test questions come from nowhere. Refuses to curve. Makes extremely offensive remarks about women & makes it clear he thinks Christianity is the only way. Talks about Obamacare twice a day despite this being a HISTORY class. Very rude. Worst class/professor I've ever had.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzY3Nzc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2013-11-05 19:54:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gibson is an alright professor. he has the tendency to digress. quiz everyday based on the chapter. He doesn't give a calendar so exams and papers are spur of the moment. but overall he is ok.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjYxOTc2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HISTORY2112","date_posted":"2013-04-30 13:59:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is great. He is very reasonable and clear with his assignments and has a passion to help students learn. He gives a ton of bonus points to help students. Go to class, read the book, do the extra credit work, and you will do fine. One of the best professors I've ever had by far.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjM2OTg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
