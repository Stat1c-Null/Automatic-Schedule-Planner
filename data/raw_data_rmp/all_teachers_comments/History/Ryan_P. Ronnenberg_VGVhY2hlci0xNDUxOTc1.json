All I did was going to class and take note base on his lecture. There will be powerpoint for you to look at but the information on it won't be enough for you to prepare for your test. Even though participation is not mandatory, his tests are entirely base on his lecture.

He is nice, monotone, and soft spoken. However he lacks knowledge of European History so it is entirely skipped with the exception of the World Wars, which last about two days tops. He skips anything war, due to it \"not being relevant\" and \"having little impact\".

He is VERY softspoken and monotonous, so be aware of that. His tests are take home and not that hard.
