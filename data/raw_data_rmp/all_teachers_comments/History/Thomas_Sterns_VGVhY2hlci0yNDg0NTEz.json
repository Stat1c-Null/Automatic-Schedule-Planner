The average score of the first test was 72, which is pretty low. But when we switched it to online due CO-VID19, he gave us assignments instead of exams. He was very chill grading them and I only made a B because of the first test. I would definetly take him again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTkwNTAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?

He is very passionate and knowledgeable about the topics he assigns, Makes lectures interesting. Go to class to get that extra credit.

You have 3 test for the semester a fourth is optional if you need to improve your grade. His test are based on lecture and textbook terms that he gives you to prepare for test. You get to create your own 5x8 notecard. The test is directly from terms that he gives you. Highly recommend if you put in work to attend","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTMzMjM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Hilarious--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
