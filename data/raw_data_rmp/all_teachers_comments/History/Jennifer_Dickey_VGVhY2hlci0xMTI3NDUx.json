However her bias will show often, you will likely have to hold your tongue in class a few times. Overall a great professor, very reasonable. Just do the work.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTkyNDQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST3325","date_posted":"2016-10-03 13:46:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's amazing. Really passionate about public history, and I feel like I've learned a lot about the field from her classes. There is a lot of group work, but she's very clear about what she wants and is really quick at responding to emails--she also grades individually in case you get a flake member. Great experience!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDA5MTg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST3325","date_posted":"2015-05-12 08:38:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"No nonsense style,  professor teaches on a graduate level. All the assignments and material are relevant and include field trips and hands-on projects.  Lots of short papers and readings.  If you plan to work in this field, the class is a must.  If you're just looking for an elective, keep looking.  Super class but for serious history majors only.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODA2MjA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST3325","date_posted":"2011-04-23 16:38:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Dickey is one of the best teachers I have had at KSU. She knows the material, and is excited about it. She is very entertaining. Attendance was not mandatory but was encouraged because participation was part of the grade. I always looked forward to going to class though.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDU2OTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST4430","date_posted":"2009-11-16 19:05:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"She really makes sure readings & class assignments are applicable and relevant to the public history field. Field trips to museums have been rewarding. She expects a lot out of you but warns you up front- if you care about your work & come prepared, you'll be fine. The class projects vary by semester, but we curated an exhibit- amazing experience!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mzc4MzQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST3326","date_posted":"2008-04-25 17:10:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dreadful quizzes over the readings that she claims will be easy, but if you miss one of the five questions you can get into trouble with the course pretty quickly.  Also grades 3 page papers pretty tough.  Nice person, not that great of a teacher...maybe because she just got her doctorate and doesn't realize she is teaching an undergrad class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MzQ5NTgy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
