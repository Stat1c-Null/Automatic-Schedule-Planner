Gives you slides at the beginning of semester that are a general outline but aren't enough to get by on. He lectures by telling history like a story and really makes it interesting. You take notes on the lectures to expand on the slide-guideline. Tests are wicked easy. 1 quiz, 2 tests, 1 final, an easy paper, and an easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDM5MTQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2009-11-04 21:19:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"do not take this class he is horrible he does not give you any notes all he does is lecture his teat are very crucial our last test average was like a 57.0 seriously, not even joking!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzE2MTE2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
