If you do all the essays and tests you will, at minimum, get a B. Even if you have a 60% average, if he sees improvement you will get a good final grade.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTc0NTI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2021-12-16 20:52:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you try, he will make sure you do well. It is a TON of work. We had essays/research papers due at the beginning of each lecture. That being said, he is an AMAZING lecturer and teacher. I retained everything he taught, my writing has also improved immensely. Tests are very difficult but he will generously curve if you have have no missing work.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTYyMzU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures--So many papers","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
