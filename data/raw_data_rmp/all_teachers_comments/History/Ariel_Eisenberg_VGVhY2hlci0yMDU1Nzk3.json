Her lectures were long and boring. She doesn't let you even glance at your phone/laptop without calling you out. She basically makes people participate by calling on you. She is a fan of group projects which I hate. She made me feel as if I were still in high school. Counts you absent if you are more than 5 mins late.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTg2NTY3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2015-11-21 13:48:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Focuses a LOT on GLBTQ/gender/women studies in the history lectures and reading.

But you gotta show up. She gives you 5 days which you can be absent from class but after that your grade will take a hit. Otherwise the class was a cakewalk.
