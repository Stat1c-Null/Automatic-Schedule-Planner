She was really picky about wording and made you work for your grade. I did homework for her class at least 2 hours everyday and still only got a B. She can be mean and is very clear about her opinions.  You must be vocal for this class, she wants people to speak up but you better have the right answer.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTE1MzQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2016-02-04 11:50:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Allen's class was easy to pass but difficult to pay attention or go to. Class lectures are solely based on what you read the night before and she will call on people to answer her questions or stop class to wait for someone to answer. Her quizzes and tests were easy if you read. They're just a written 1 page paper on the topic of the chapter!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDI3ODk3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2015-12-15 09:52:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved taking this course! I honestly did not agree with everything that was in the Howard Zinn books (beign im a Republican) however I enjoyed listening and learning new views. This class expanded my horizons in many ways than one! Thanks so much Professor Allen! As long as you read and ATTEND CLASS you will make an A. Make sure to take notes.

I was disappointed to find out that she was not teaching the second part of this class next semester. There is a lot of reading and she makes you work for the answers to her questions, but we had some really interesting discussions in her class. I would 100% take her class again even with how difficult it was.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Njc3NjM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2015-11-19 01:23:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Allen is a great instructor. The chapters are sometimes long, but the assigned book gives you a different perspective on history. PLEASE complete your readings. She expects full participation from the class. Lectures are actually class discussions. 3 tests in this course: In-class, take home, and final exam.  I'd take her class again.
