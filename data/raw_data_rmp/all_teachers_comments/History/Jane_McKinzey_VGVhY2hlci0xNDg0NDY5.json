Almost half of each class period is spent on talking about the news. Lectures tended to be very broad and uninformative (though I will admit they got better at the end) You have to read the the book and teach yourself to do well.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTU1OTIz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2271","date_posted":"2014-12-18 18:15:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very tough....

She will make you WORK hard for the grade (God forbid). I bombed the first paper and a quiz, but came out with a B in the class. Expect to do a ton of reading and get ready to write a paper a week. When you come out of the class with a &quot;B&quot; pat yourself on the back!

Sometimes its respectable how much dedication she has to high standards of the required work.  More often than not, its annoying that she is a history teacher and grades everything with more of a fine tooth comb than any literature teacher ive ever had.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjY4MDE2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
