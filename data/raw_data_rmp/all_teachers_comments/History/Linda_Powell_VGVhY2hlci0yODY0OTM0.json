She was very clear about what was due and when and was always available through email should you need assistance with something. It was a very easy course and I 100% recommend her if you are looking for a good teacher.

I think she had emails on auto because if I didn't log into class for a certain amount of time, she would email and then say disregard. Class material was easy, discussion/response every other week and modules every week. Very lenient grader. Easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTM5MjMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
