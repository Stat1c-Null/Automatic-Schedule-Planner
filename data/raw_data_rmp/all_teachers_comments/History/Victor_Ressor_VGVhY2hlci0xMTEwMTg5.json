Tests are extremely hard. I wish he offered a study guide or more study materials because its often hard to know what exactly to study for exams since there is SO much information in lectures.

He has writing assignments which are not graded that hard as long as the material talks about what he wants. The lecture videos aren't required for you to watch but he does go into some depth, the online work does a good job of that.
