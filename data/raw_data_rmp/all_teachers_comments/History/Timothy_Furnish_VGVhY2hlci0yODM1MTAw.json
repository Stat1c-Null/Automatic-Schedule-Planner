He is a great professor makes everything very clear, only like 5 grades and they are all papers but they are all legit the same topic just different time periods. He is very easy to talk to, and understanding.

He is super understanding and wants you to learn the content. He knows what he is talking about so his lectures really help you. He offers a lot of extra credit and gives you feedback on your test.

He's very passive agressive meaning he'll yell at the whole class if you don't know the answer to something and then try to make a funny quip afterwards. Dick. If you hate writing AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS. 4 essays in total and two of them were due at last week. Please avoid him!!!!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTc4NDU2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
