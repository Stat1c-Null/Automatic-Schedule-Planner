You never use the book except for an extra credit assignment at the end.  Attendance not mandatory, all ppts online and the material really is interesting stuff if you care about history.  I would take him again and recommend everyone to him. Drops lowest test grade.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDQ3MjM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2011-12-07 17:30:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Valenzuela genuinely wants his students to do well.  His lectures are kinda boring because all he does is read from Powerpoints but he will throw in a joke.  There are 4 tests and the lowest grade is dropped.  So if you do well on the first 3 you don't have to take the final.  Class is not mandatory but he tries to reward attendance.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDEzOTQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2011-11-14 10:11:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is one of the nicest people I have encountered, ever. He responds very quickly to emails, very attentive, and will answer any questions you may have. He is funny and charming, and the tests are reasonable. He doesn't have mandatory attendance, but trust me you're going to actually want to go to class. I think anyone can enjoy this man.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjMwMjEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2011-11-03 16:06:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"He really loves history and knows what he is talking about!

He doesn't require attendance and doesn't use a book, all powerpoints go online. The studyguides are sorta useless, just READ the 100 slide powerpoints and it really helps. He drops the lowest test and always puts extra credit essays at the end of them.
