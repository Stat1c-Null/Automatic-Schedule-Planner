This is a good class to have group work in, you will have a few group projects but it super fun and helpful for education majors.

She is what every teacher should strive to be. She is so passionate about history education and it really shows through. There are a lot of assignments but they're easy and very beneficial. If you walk out of her class not like her you need to rethink your career goals.
