I enjoyed going to his class, recommend going doesn't post power points. Test material only covers powerpoints & quizzes only cover material from textbook.I had to study a lot for this class,test you really have to read over the questions, bc they can be tricky. I want him  to teach another class so i can take him again!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTU4OTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2011-05-09 12:48:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"I enjoyed professor Cater's class! I'm not going to say his class was easy at all, he really challenged me. I studied rather hard for each test and only made in the range of 85-87 on all the tests. Knows his material, is actually interested in it too(which is refreshing). I Recommend taking him! i would take another class w/him even with my 87.5","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTU4ODYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2011-05-01 20:03:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely good looking, lovely voice. History is my least favorite subject and he made it somewhat interesting for me. Also took a tremendous amount of stress of at the end of the semester with an exempt final exam :) BARELY passed the class, fully enjoyed it though.

No papers. Takes attendance sometimes. Does NOT post Powerpoints & his exams are from the Powerpoints, not the book. You have to write out the Powerpoint in your notes the entire class period. Only the pop quizzes are from the textbook. Nice guy but be prepard for writer's cramp.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDgwNDUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2011-04-11 13:27:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome professor! Exams and quizzes are easy, but you have to go to class. 5 exams, a final, and a few pop quizzes. He tells you to get the textbook, but it is not necessary because all of his exam questions are covered in the notes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Mzg4Nzgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2010-12-01 13:27:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Cater is a really good teacher. You have to go to class if you want the notes  because he doesn't post them online. He has a makeup test day on the class before the final where you can makeup any or all tests. There are quizzes that come from the readings in the book but only about once every week or so. I'd recommend him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODM4NTAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
