He has great lectures \"basically stories\" that really help you understand what he is teaching. You will have to read two books, but the books are very interesting and give great perspective of WWI. He grades is assignments fairly and gives good feedback.

However, he does truly care about all of his students. Just be respectful, and he will respect you. We read two books + the textbook this semester and wrote in class essays on them.

Clear and fair grader, tells you what he wants, so do it. Super nice guy all bark and no bite, and was extremely understanding.

They're engaging, though he often diverts into storytelling taking away from finishing covering the material. Two Book Review Exams, a Midterm, and a Final that are all written in Blue Books and an Oral Presentation. The more detail you add, the better your grade is.

When everybody tells the professor thank you for the semester and they wished they could take him again, you know it is somebody worth taking.

His lectures are unlike anything I have ever had before, and he brings the two world wars to life in the classroom.
