No notes online, notes in class don't make sense. Rambles on for entire period, essays are confusing, map quizzes aren't bad as long as you study. It's not easy, he is kind of pretentious, doesn't use D2L so don't bother checking it for notes. Super nice guy though","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjQ4NTA5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-05-01 15:53:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hey, do you like writing essays?If so, take this guy.Owenby goes out of his way to make this simple core required class as difficult for you as possible.The essay questions are usually complicated, and the final is really complicated.I don't hate this guy at all, he's a smart guy, but it's aggrivating. No notes will be online for you, of course.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjQ4NDM3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2013-04-30 11:26:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! He gives you unrealistic limitations on assignments. There are 5 in the entire semester and he keeps you in the dark about your grade! No D2L.He doesn't use the book. All he does is babble on and on about information that has no relation to the essays, which is all you do in the class other than the random 10 sec. map quizzes","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjM1NTQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-04-09 12:56:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. One of the WORST professors I have ever had. Extremely unhelpful, does not answer emails because he thinks he's too god for D2L. Map Quizzes will kill your grade b/c they're unrealistically timed & you cannot read his handwriting. He has you buy ANOTHER book for just one essay. Avoid at all costs.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTA2NTgy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-03-11 17:22:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE HIM! he gives us pop map quizzes randomly and gives you 90 seconds to do it. All of his tests are essays. We just turned in the midterm (our first grade besides the quizzes) and  we have another essay right after spring break! Class is boring and you have to go or you'll miss a quiz! Don't do it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDAyMzYx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
