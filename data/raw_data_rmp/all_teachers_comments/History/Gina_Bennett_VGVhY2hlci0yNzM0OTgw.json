All of you test are easy you write in class, she will give you the topics before the test. Class is not mandatory she makes you sign in to use as a reference to your grade if you have concerns.

Like the exams are essay but if you do go to class they are easy I think I got an 98 in the class it was so easy.

As long as you show up to class every time every semester, you should have an A in this class. She gave us a map exam, which the more places you knew, the higher your grade for that exam.

Her course was easy. And i mean very easy. I did the absolute bare minimum and I have a 99% in the course. I almost never read the textbook except to review right before an exam.
