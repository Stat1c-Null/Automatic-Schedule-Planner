It was more interesting than I expected. I always enjoyed listening to lectures and writing the research paper. There were study guides for each of the 2 exams and possible test questions. These were extremely helpful. I thought he graded fairly.

He is a hard grader, essay test. MUST READ MATERIAL! DO THE EXTRA CREDIT 1pt.=1%overall grade.Very willing to help. I was struggling and bugged him until I got it.

I thoroughly enjoyed his class and he worked with me after a family problem.Don't miss more than 5 days or else you will not receive his 5 extra attendance points. The books in for this class are CRUCIAL to have. All of his tests are essay form and you WILL need to actually read them!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODgxOTMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2206","date_posted":"2010-11-19 10:39:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice guy. Soft spoken. He grades harshly but fairly like said. Few problems. His lectures are kind of bland and don't really convey info that well. You never know what he expects you to know on the test. And the textbook he uses is AWFUL. Worst history textbook I've used at KSU. It literally has no real form or structure.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzkyMDQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST3358","date_posted":"2010-07-26 14:15:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"2 essay tests, 2 papers and extra credit for attendance.
