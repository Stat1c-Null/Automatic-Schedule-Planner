They were all 28ish questions-constructed response and timed. Not really sure if I would take him again but it was easy not having a lot of grades (only if you study good before the test).

It seemed like the professor did not know how to manage an online class - I never knew what my test grades were (still don't to this day). It was great he gives you a study guide for the tests, so that made it pretty easy. 3 tests and a final - no other homework.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDIxNDE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLLS1101","date_posted":"2020-01-13 23:26:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Personally I really liked Professor Clay. I think you definitely had to teach yourself some things, but overall if you show up to class you could very easily make an A. He was also very caring and accommodating with students and he definitely tried his best to make everyone happy. Also, the only homework we ever had was to study which was great.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODMxNDk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2019-12-14 21:01:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is easy. If you're okay with teaching yourself the materials. By the end of the semester we only had 3 grades, all of which were tests over 5 chapters at a time. Only lectures, and is late with grading, giving us study guides, etc. Week 3 into the course before we had a syllabus and we never got an official book.

He's a really bad teacher but his study guides are pretty close to the tests. The class is test heavy, no attendance, and he gives plenty of leave way. You won't learn anything but you'll get the credit.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzk0Mzkz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
