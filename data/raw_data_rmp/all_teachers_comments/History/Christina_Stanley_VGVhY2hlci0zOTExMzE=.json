She made the class much harder than other AP classes and assigned a bunch of busy work that made it difficult to manage enough time to study for the tests.

Boring powerpoint lectures. I would read for reading quizzes and still fail them.

Useless lectures, inaccurate, poor spelling skills, unable to intelligently converse in her area of study. KSU has many great instructors, and many poor ones, C Stanley tops my all time list of the bad. Phone-it-in teaching at best, dangerously unqualified at worst.

She is not interested in accuracy nor professionalism. She has the uncanny ability to take an interesting subject and make it as boring.
