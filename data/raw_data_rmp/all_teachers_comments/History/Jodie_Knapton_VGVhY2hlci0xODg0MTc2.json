Professor Knapton made it nearly impossible for any student to fail the class. If you took the quizzes on time, you always benefitted from a curve (even if a student happened to make a 100 on a quiz). I'm not a big history person, but Professor Knapton made me eager to learn history!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTE3Njc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HISTORY2112","date_posted":"2014-10-06 19:07:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"I'll be honest, I did not really listen at all in this class and managed to make a B. Her extra credit is no joke. She makes it to where it is almost impossible to fail. She's super energetic and passionate about history. Her only flaw is not being able to grade things quickly. Other than that, awesome professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjMzNDgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2014-09-30 20:39:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Knapton was very energetic and interesting.

Tests were simple and written examples were from a mixture of lecture and PowerPoint. Was exceptionally late on grading assignments, but I don't see how this is that big a deal.

Her passion and energy for history is contagious and she is very animated when demonstrating different perspectives.
