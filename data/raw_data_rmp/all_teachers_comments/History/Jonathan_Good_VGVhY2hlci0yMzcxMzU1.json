His tests are all written answers, but he gives a study guide with the questions beforehand. Class is graded out of 3 tests, 2 papers and 1 final. The final is worth the majority of your grade, so definitely study!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzI4NDky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Amazing lectures--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2019-01-01 20:12:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"A class you will never be bored in. He has personal experiences to share for each section and is very funny. About five tests and two papers so make sure to study. Make sure to read the book because some test questions will be about it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTgzNTE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2018-12-28 06:41:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor is nice but not a good teacher. I never knew where he was getting his information from. You have to read the book like crazy and the power points and the vocab in order to make an A. There are 4 tests 2 papers and a final. The test are heavy on information and very hard. No extra credit and he is rude about questions. Avoid if possible.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTY3NjQ1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2018-05-04 16:13:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Good is new at KSU but he's awesome!! I took him for gen ed history and he grades kinda tough because he expected a lot. Towards the end of the semester he kind of lightened up on us. He is super funny and entertaining and really nice! You will like him! 4 tests, a final, and 2 papers. But they were easy! Easy B but an A is possible too!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTg4ODcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
