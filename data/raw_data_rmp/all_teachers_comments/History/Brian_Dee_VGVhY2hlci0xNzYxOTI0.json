Quizzes are hard but makes the exams easy, same type of questions.  Stickler on quotes from the readings in the essays.  Not difficult but need to stay on the readings.  Wish I'd been warned.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzA0Njk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-04-22 15:42:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Like others have said, there is a quiz every week, which are hard, but then he asks them again on the midterm.  He asks you to write five short papers over the semester, but tells you how to write them beforehand.  Pretty easy to get an A if you doing the reading and write the papers.  Seems strict, but if you talk to him, he's not.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTc5NTEy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-04-15 16:26:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"omg, this is an easy A.  He gives a quiz every week to make sure you do the reading, then asks the same questions on the midterm.  Then he asks you to write 5 short papers over the semester, and tells you how to write them.  Take him if you want an easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTM4NjUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-03-27 14:02:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Attendance is mandatory, there are readings and quizzes every week so you have to keep up.  If you study it is an easy A.  You also have to do five short papers in the semester but if you follow the directions and answer the question, it is easy to get full points which are 50% of your grade.  Take him.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDU0NDMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-02-27 08:43:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"He seems likeable, but the class is a guaranteed \"C\". The online quizzes are nearly impossible, even with reading the 20-30 page chapters assigned EVERY WEEK. Going to class is mandatory, but his lecture almost seems different from the tests. Just study from the online quizzes he assigns, and COME TO CLASS ON TIME AND TURN YOUR PHONE OFF. Avoid!!!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMzY5Nzc4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-02-24 15:38:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very hard to learn in this class. He assigns readings along with documents every weekend before class and you take an online quiz on the readings before you ever learn about it in class. Class time is wasted, but attendance is mandatory. His power points are a copy from the books website, he just stands and talks for the class and is very unclear.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMzYyNTk3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-01-29 15:35:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take this class if you can't learn on your own. His class time is very useless. The chapters that you have to read EVERY week are anywhere from 30-50 pages long. Its a lot of reading. The weekly quizzes over the chapters are difficult. Also, you have to write a paper weekly. It's my most stressful class by far. AVOID this class if you can.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMzA1NDY0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2012-11-12 13:31:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"In class time is not used well, seems to go off on a tangent often, stutters frequently, and does not follow ppts but attendance affects grade. One quiz for ever chapter and 3 tests, not cumulative. Tests taken DIRECTLY from quizzes. Don't take if you can't audibly learn.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE3NTI3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-11-05 22:43:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Grades in this class are made up of quizzes and midterms (which are not cumulative). I reccomend using the book's website to your benefit (bedfordstmartins.com). Take practice quizzes because taking the actual ones, and study the outlines. I honestly don't find class time valuable. In other words, very boring. Quizzes out of 10, so miss 3 and a C.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzgzMTgx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
