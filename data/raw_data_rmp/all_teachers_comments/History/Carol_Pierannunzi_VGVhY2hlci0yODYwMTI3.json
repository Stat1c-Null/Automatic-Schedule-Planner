She expects you to already know the information which is bad if you are a freshman. She talks a lot and doesn't have any good notes, her tests are long for no reason, and if you miss her class one time you are going to be screwed over the next day.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4Mjg5NjYw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2024-01-09 00:18:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Please do not take this professor. She is terrible. There is 4 Quizzes and 4 Tests, and they are all on lockdown with webcam. If you pay attention in class, and understand, you still will struggle. The test is usually 80 questions, sometimes over things we didn't even learn in class. So please, don't take her.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODUxNzIx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2023-12-13 03:16:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"The only class I've dropped at KSU. Makes you take current events quizzes with full lockdown browser (she wants you to pay attention to the news 24/7). Gives out extremely bad notes and makes you rely on the textbook, tests are very long and full lockdown browser. You can get a better POLS professor.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjQyMzQ3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2023-12-09 23:53:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the Easiest classes I have taken. I recommend taking detailed notes as she goes over a lot of content. The content itself is not difficult. She actively seeks out participation from the class and will call people out randomly. This class is a high school-level class it's nothing crazy. Each test has around 60 questions.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTkyMTgw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
