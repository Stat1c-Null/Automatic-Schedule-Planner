Tests are open-note and open-book (he brings the books). Quizzes are the same except you are also allowed electronics. Slides are underlined with the info that you will need to know. Only thing is that attendance is 11 points.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjI0ODY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2017-12-11 14:41:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"very easy A yet some people struggled sooo much cause they would not come to class or have notes for open note tests. Only bad thing is attendance.. each class counts 1 point out off 11 so if you miss 11 classes the highest grade u can make is B.
