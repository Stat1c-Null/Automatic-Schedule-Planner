However, if you do you will probably make an A. His tests are over exactly what he says in class, and he takes it almost completely out of the book. You don't have to read the whole book though... he tells you what to highlight and learn during class. I don't like history, but this class was good.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExNDY5ODEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HISTORY","date_posted":"2006-01-07 19:06:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very good! his test is very easy and the essays too!
