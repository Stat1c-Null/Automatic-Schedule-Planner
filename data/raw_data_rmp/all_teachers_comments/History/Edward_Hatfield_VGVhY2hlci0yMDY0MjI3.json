If you go to class, pay attention and read the chapters assigned ( I skimmed them and got a high B in the class) and you'll do well . There is a paper that isn't explained well but I made a 90 on it. Show up and take good notes and he'll show some sympathy for you when it comes to grading.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODE2NTM2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2016-05-13 18:08:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"A lot of work. 2 bks, often gives pop quizzes on the reading. He's passionate about history & knowledgeable. It was daunting trying to prepare for exams. He does give a study guide that gives you a topic for the essay portion but that's the most prep you get. You're expected to study 5 chapters+the reading from the 2nd bk + take superb notes.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTY4ODI2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2016-05-04 23:20:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lectures are very dificult. Note taking is almost impossible in this class, because he just talks about it, not really giving anything specific to write down. He expects you to read over 1,000 pages in the books. DO NOT TAKE. His tests are all handwritten and very few do well. I REPEAT, DO. NOT. TAKE.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDcyMDc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
