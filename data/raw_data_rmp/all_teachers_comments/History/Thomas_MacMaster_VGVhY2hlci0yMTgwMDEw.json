He knows what he is talking about and clearly has a great interest in what he teaches. A few very short papers are given during the course. HUGE curve on tests.

His lectures are a bit boring at times because a lot of the information is... well from a powerpoint. However, you do the study guides and put in effort into the papers he asks from you and you should end up with an A. He is an amazing professor and very understanding.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzExMjU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2017-05-12 11:39:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is a lecture-based class, but Dr. MacMaster makes it interesting. He puts all of his presentations online, but you still need to to come and pay attention to every lecture. There's a lot of information, and if you aren't willing to pay 100% attention you will be confused, and it will be your fault.
