Attendance is mandatory, but you are allowed to miss 3 classes without penalty. All of the PowerPoint he uses are posted on D2L and the tests cover information directly from them. There are 4 tests, all multiple choice. If you're looking for an easy world history class,  this is the professor to take.

He will help you during quizzes and tests and you are only graded on two quizzes, a midterm and final. He is a great professor, if you study the powerpoints you will do good on the grades.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzY5MDA0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HON3301","date_posted":"2019-10-15 19:41:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was supposed to be an honors class and I felt like I was back in 4th-grade English. All we did in the class was take turns reading the book we were supposed to have read before class as homework. There are two papers and that is all. Meh professor at best. He is very smart but not the best at teaching literature.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMjg3NTQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
