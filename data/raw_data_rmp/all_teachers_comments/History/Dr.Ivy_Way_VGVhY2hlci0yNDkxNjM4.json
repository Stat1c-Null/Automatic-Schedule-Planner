She is funny and seems like a great person, but she gives out way too much homework and she makes you read like every day. I can't keep up with all the work cause I'm too busy with other more important classes. I would advise you to try not taking her class unless it's a last option.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzQ3MzQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112H","date_posted":"2023-08-28 15:58:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Too much homework for a class of this level. She doesn't only assign an average of 8 textbook pages per day, but she frequently gave us documentaries (10-40min) with occasional quizzes on the documentaries alone. Her extra credit policy is easy and really quite generous but in my opinion doesn't make the class worth taking.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTkxOTk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112H","date_posted":"2023-05-05 13:20:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely do not take this professor. This was the biggest waste of time in my academic career thus far. The amount of course work required in this basic level course is ridiculous and obnoxious to say the least. DO NOT take this class.

She has so much knowledge on events in history and is a very easy class as long as you just stay updated and read the text books.

She is so freaking sweet and funny and insanely smart. Take all the notes and read all the things. None of it is that hard.
