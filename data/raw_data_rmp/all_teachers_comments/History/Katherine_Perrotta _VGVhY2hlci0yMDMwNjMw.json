Her classes are well organized and her teaching and tests are very straight forward. All her tests are from her lectures and PowerPoints. Yes, the textbook is required but it's not necessary to read everything. You can still get by from just skimming the chapters.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjIxMDI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2019-01-10 19:28:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this as an online class and loved it.
