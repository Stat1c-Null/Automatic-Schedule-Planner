If you enjoy ancient history, this class is for you.  However, I have no interest in it, so it was hard for me to stay focused on her loooong boring lectures.  Also, she grades your papers like a strict English professor, which seemed a little odd to me","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMjM1NjMx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2006-07-17 13:11:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"I disagree with previous posts. Yes, there is a lot of material to learn, but she is clear, organized and very helpful, always willing to answer questions.

This class was taught like a history graduate class might be.  Unless you like tests over 20+ chapters and long essays picked over for grammatical errors, stay away!

It seemed as though she was more interested in how many people she could get to drop the class, rather than teaching.  It is pretty bad when she lectures from a piece of paper and people in the class know more abouth the subject than she does.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEwODk0ODM3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2005-11-09 14:38:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's so cool: fun, clear, demanding but fair.

The book is a great source to get familiar with the maps but not really necessary because the maps can be accessed through the website for students.
