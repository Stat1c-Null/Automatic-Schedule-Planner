He literally is the epitomy of a HORRIBLE professor! To sum things up, he can barely hear a thing you say, barely knows his facts, and is just a complete dumbass. His tests are completely random and he doesnt help you study at all AND he often insults students for asking him to repeat something.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTMyNjU1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
