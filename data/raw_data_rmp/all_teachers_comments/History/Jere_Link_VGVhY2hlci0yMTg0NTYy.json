I honestly have no idea what will be on his tests. His study guides are convoluted and his lectures are equally as confusing.

He is hilarious and caring. However, he does want us to read and gives pop quizzes sometimes. If you read, pay attention, and write well doing tests you can get an easy A. He also gives a good curve on every tests and would definitely take him again if I could.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODUwNzQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2016-12-06 23:48:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Link is an awesome professor. So long as you show that you are putting forth good effort in his class, he will always reward you. Really funny and his tests are always pertinent to the lecture. He's flexible on material depending on student demands and he gives you good challenges/study guides. This class has been my favorite!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzYxNjQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":7,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2016-12-05 17:36:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"The notes MIGHT be on the test; there are no guarantees. His study guides are very confusing and also might not be on the test. He posts assignments about 30 mins. before class on D2l. His lectures are also confusing . You will be stressed 24/7.

If you have ADD or ADHD get ready to not learn anything! He jumps from topic to topic with no transition. He will get off track and still expect us to know what is going on. Although a really awesome guy he's a HORRIBLE teacher. Study guides are just paper with letters on it. No clarity.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzI4NTgy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":8,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2016-11-15 18:30:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Link was the most inconsistent, ridiculous professor I have ever had. The readings he has students do for class do not correlate with his lectures, not like his lectures correlate with his quizzes. I thought that history was just facts of events that occurred, but in Dr. Link's class, you'll hear about stories in history that don't matter.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTkzOTg0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2016-11-02 11:12:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher!
