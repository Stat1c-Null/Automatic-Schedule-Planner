She's been teaching like, forever, and I was lucky enough to take her during her last semester teaching (Summer 2014). I think I wish she was my grandma or something.

Class is very straight forward. Test are short answer and essay format, but she gives an extensive study guide. If you study the guide youll do fine.

The papers were long but easy, graded fairly for content and grammar. Presentation was 20 minutes long on a topic you pick, they were interesting.

The class dragged every now and then, but it wasn't too bad. As long as you go to class and pay attention you should be fine; reading wasn't completely necessary, but you might want to at least skim assigned chapters. She really knows what she's talking about.
