This class is such a easy A. and Prof. Gardner gives great lectures. The grades are based on 10% attendance , 45% midterm and the final which is 45% as well. The exam questions are straight off of the power points which he posts on D2L. Super easy. I would definitely take him again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzk2OTI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2018-05-30 09:52:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Attendance is 10% of your grade.

Although those two tests hold a lot of weight, they are the easiest tests. The content on the test is exactly copy and paste off the PowerPoints. I would 12/10 take him again if I needed to.

The lectures are a waste of time, but he will randomly take roll and if your not there you will lose attendance points. 10% of your grade is strictly attendance so just go to class. If you take his 2 and a half hour class he will let you out an hour early every time.

No homework, or quizzes. No textbook. He says attendance isn't mandatory but he does take roll at random times and uses that for your participation grade.
