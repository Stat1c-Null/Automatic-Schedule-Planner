They are a lot of content and require a lot of studying just to make a C. She lectures straight from memory no powerpoint. If you miss something, oh well! She has an accent but isn't hard to understand. The class is way to hard for this to be a gen ed course.

She teachers history like a story and has a great sense of humor. She doesn't just point at a power point. If you listen and take notes, you can't go wrong.

She does not use the book but she has it memorized.  I definitely reccomend that you bring a tape recorder.  Her tests are difficult but she tells you what is on it before hand.

She talks super fast, will not repeat herself or slow down. If you miss a day or can't keep up by writing down EVERYTHING she says you will probably fail. Over 80% of my classmates failed. She does give out the test ahead of time but you must put down her answers not just a correct one & grammar does count.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODI3OTA5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1102","date_posted":"2012-11-06 13:07:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is incredibly challenging, but worth it! I have Mrs. V for World History, and she starts weeding out the slackers from day one. In order to be successful in the class, you have to WORK. If you don't have an interest in putting in copious time and effort, you will most likely drop or fail the class.

I love her approach and learnt a lot from her. She challenges you but it is worth it.

All the tests were essay answers. She gives you the questions to the tests, but you have to answer them the way SHE wants you to. I had most of the questions answered correctly but still failed.

If you ask her questions she gives u answers. She gives you the questions and answer to every test s if you fail, you must not care. The only hard test is the final because it's long but STUDY and ask questions. Dont bother buying the book, borrow it from a friend.
