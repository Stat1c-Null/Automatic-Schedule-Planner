I'd recommend taking notes on a laptop. Final is take home. Map quizzes are easy. Posts lecture outlines & quiz outlines online. Great story teller, highly recommended if you enjoy history. Do what he asks not too time consuming & you can make an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDM1Njc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
