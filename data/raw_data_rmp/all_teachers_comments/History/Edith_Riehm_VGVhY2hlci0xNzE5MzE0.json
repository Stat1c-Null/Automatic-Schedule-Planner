You have to study for your test and you have to do your article assignments. This is college people, you have to work for your degree.

She had tons of stories to tell and uses power points every day. There is reading due EVERY SINGLE CLASS. There are 4 tests- handwritten, multiple choice and essay.If you don't want to work don't take her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTg4Mzcw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2013-01-08 14:01:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was the worst class i have taken in college so far. Dr Reihm is mean and her class is a joke. She goes over all this useless material and then makes her tests format similar to that of a 3rd grade history test. If you have any other options other then her then take it. DO NOT TAKE HER! Way too old to be teaching","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjI5MTM2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-11-12 14:36:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"She loves chronology for quizzes and tests, though she won't emphasize it much during lecture. For tests she would only tell us to use the powerpoints as a study guide. If you knew the study guide material you could do well. She expects well written essays and will take off for what seem like small errors. She expects class participation.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE3OTU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2012-10-23 19:14:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her test questions were easy if you study her study guide but even if you get all of them right, you WILL still fail the test if you are not a great writer like she is. She will also point out little mistakes. Attendence is mandatory, but it wont helpyou get a better grade. She hates when you show up late, but she did it more than once.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzI5Njc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2012-10-06 11:22:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Riehm is... well she's just difficult. Must be nice to have that PhD- unless you want one, wouldn't take her. I missed ONE grade and already, can't pass the class with even a C- it wasn't even a test I missed. Withdrawing for my own good.

Took her for Post Reconstruction American History. If no work is your goal don't take her. She will lecture and test on related topics. And you will have to read the book on your own as she assigns it.
