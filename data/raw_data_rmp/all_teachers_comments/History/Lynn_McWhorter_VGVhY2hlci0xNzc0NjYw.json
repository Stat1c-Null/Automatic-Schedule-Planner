He often tells stories in class and puts them on the exams. Multiple choice/true false exams with some questions from the text book.

Even though he goes on random tangents sometimes, I think it kept me attentive in class! As long as you show up, his class is pretty easy! Willing to help and super nice.

If you couldn't make it through this class you shouldn't be in college. Just go to class and he tells you almost exactly what will be on the test. I went to class everyday, studied an hour before the exam and made an A easy (And I don't even like history!).","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTA0OTAz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-12-17 14:16:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"He tried to be helpful but just wasn't. I'm sorry to say this, but he does not fit with the other teachers at KSU. Having 4 test grades with no other grades just isn't how things are done at KSU, and it definitely hurt my friends and I in the class. We took the class expecting Prof Gorshkov, not this guy. He was open to differing viewpoints though.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDk5NTQ3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-12-15 13:59:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Horrible! He was late to our final exam. He lied by saying we would have a study guide. We only had a study guide for the first and last test. He goes off tangent. cant answer some questions. puts random questions on the test. AVOID THIS CLASS!! I wish I would have. He definitely was not much help at all to me.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDgxMjk0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-12-14 13:56:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not the worst professor but not the best. The lectures would go off tangent, he was respectful to his students but at times if a student asked him a question he wouldn't have an answer. The one thing that did get to me was he promised part multiple choice and part essay the first day, but instead the first test was all essay. Hes a last resort pro.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDcxMzMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-12-13 08:50:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"It is untrue to say of Dr. WcWhorter, as someone has on here, that he did not provide a study guide after the first test. This student must have dropped out long before the final. He is so helpful, his cell number in on the sylabus; if emailed, he responds the same day. As an atheist, I find him very open-minded and fair. I welcome him to KSU!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDUxNzM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2012-12-12 14:56:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would definitely recommend this professor! He is extremely nice and funny, which always keeps the class interesting. There is no reason not to get an A in this class, just be prepared to review the notes he posts online and do the readings in the textbook. He cares about his students and wants to see them succeed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDM5MTc3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-12-12 11:07:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Although his tests were inconsistent he was an easy professor because he provided almost all the material in class and never gave any petty assignments. He did add more readings as the course went on but any questions over information from the book were easy to recall. Just show up, do the readings and pay attention and you'll ace his course.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDM1NjU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2012-12-03 18:44:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gave a study guide for the 1st test which was extremely helpful. But for the next 3 tests he did not. Didn't feel prepared for the exams. Lectures were scattered. Didn't post notes online until the after the 2nd test bc he hates technology. Not a bad guy..I wouldn't take him again. Curves sometimes but it is minimal. Do-able class without the book.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTQwMDI5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
