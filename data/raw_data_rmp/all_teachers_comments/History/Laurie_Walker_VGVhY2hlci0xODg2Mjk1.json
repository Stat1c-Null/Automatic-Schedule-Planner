She has a really dry sense of humor so be prepared for that. And yes, she does punish the entire class if you use your electronics but those are only bonus points. Most of the class was just presentations and our tests were all online.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTc0MjMx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2014-04-28 15:01:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"OCD about class operations - her syllabus is a packet. she is strict and has poor people skills. her personal life effects student teacher relations. zero electronics allowed. the class is easy but demands a lot of time. she is more suited for online courses.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTE0NjQ5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2014-03-25 11:48:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Smart lady. She isn't approachable.  The class itself is easy.  You have to buy your textbook new to get a code for online work, but you only use it a few times.  She has a weird policy about cell phones and will punish the whole class by taking away points if one person breaks the rule.  Kinda annoying and juvenile.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTQ0NDg5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
