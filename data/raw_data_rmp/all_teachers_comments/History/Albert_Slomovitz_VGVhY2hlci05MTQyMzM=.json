The first few classes he will show you his book with all that he highlighted but once everyone has a book he doesn't anymore. He does not use powerpoints, he either reads quotes from the book which you want to take note of. He gives 2 test and a final. All are 28 Qs and a 2 paragraph essay. He does take attendance.
