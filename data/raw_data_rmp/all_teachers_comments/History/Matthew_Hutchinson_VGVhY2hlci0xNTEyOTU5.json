He's a funny guy but he makes a lot of awkward comments concerning women, uncomfortable at times. Quizzes were more like tests, and I found them to be hard even when I studied the whole day. You use the website more than the book definitely. I don't think I would take him again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjE2ODI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2011-11-10 16:01:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor is passionate but its not an easy class.... maybe if you love history. Alot of material.. Quizzes are long and extremely hard, more like tests. You have to study a huge amount of material to cover what the quiz alone will be over and he doesnt narrow it down at all.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjEwMDI2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2011-09-28 20:53:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is absolutely amazing and he makes it worth going to class! He gives a lot of extra credit, but even the quizzes are easy if you pay attention.

Mostly lectures with powerpoints, but they're interesting and he also shows video. You have to do a lot of vocab but you can use the internet.
