The readings were from interesting sources and related around central themes each week. We wrote a 2-3 page response to the readings at the end of the week then participated in group discussions around the same topic. The final project was reworking an existing lesson plan.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTQ4ODIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2017-06-30 10:39:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Okie is a nice guy but he is not a good professor. His lectures are disorganized, he skips parts of history (WWI /WWII) and spends too much time on others, he has no clear grading criteria, and definitely has favorite students. He built the class with no tests so we could \"experience history\" but the class ended up being a confused mess.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDk4MTE5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"SO MANY PAPERS--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2017-05-11 20:53:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"he is a really good professor who wants his students to succeed.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjkwNTQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2017-05-04 19:15:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor ever","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjE2MTQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HISTED3271","date_posted":"2016-12-08 13:16:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Want a teacher that is disorganized and doesn't really know much about what he is doing? Then William Okie is your man.  He doesn't know much about history in general.  His only good quality is he knows how to analyze primary.  If he doesn't like you then you are screwed.  He will grade you on emotion instead of his rubric,if he has one.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Mzg5MTcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2016-07-25 00:39:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took for Summer of 2016. No tests, only midterm and final. Homework is every day; analyzing long documents to discuss in the next class session. Grades on not only attendance, but even engagement in a lecture-heavy class. Every class is a lecture, notes on board are very disorganized. Tests are mainly over class discussion, not notes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODMwMTM1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HHIST2112","date_posted":"2016-04-21 23:57:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Honors. He's super nice and he genuinely wants you to enjoy history and his class and not get caught up in memorizing, so he doesn't give tests. We did a lot of analyzing papers online and then discussing them in class and then we read two books and did projects over them. The final was an oral presentation.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzUyNzky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":10,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
