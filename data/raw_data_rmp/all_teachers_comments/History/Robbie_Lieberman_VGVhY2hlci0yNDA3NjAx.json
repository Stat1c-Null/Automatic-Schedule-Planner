She never lets you leave early and she expects you to talk the whole time even though you have written discussions right before class. Also she never grades weekly discussions so you will not know your grade until the end. Wouldn't recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjQwODI4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Skip class?

She always offers a brilliant insight to the matters she speaks on. Do your assignments / readings, don't fall too far behind, speak up in class, and you'll be fine. She is very accommodating and helpful, especially if she sees that you're engaging with the class and course materials.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDM3NDc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAX3780","date_posted":"2018-10-04 01:01:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lieberman is such a nice lady and a good teacher as well. There's only two tests during the course and they're both either take home or open note. The only downside of the course was that there are four papers but they're pretty easy papers. She great though! Very smart and very nice. Youll learn a lot from this course.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTQxOTgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--SO MANY PAPERS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
