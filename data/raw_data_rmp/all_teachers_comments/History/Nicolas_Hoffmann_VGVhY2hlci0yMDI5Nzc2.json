I don't really enjoy history classes but he makes it very enjoyable. Quizzes every class on readings that are 4 questions, the last question goes over to quizzes with low grades. Tests are tough, but only 2 of them, and are curved. It's possible to make an A if you study for the tests.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjEwOTQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2015-12-14 19:43:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really great professor. explains things clearly and is very willing to help when needed. would take again","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NjkxNjE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2015-12-14 10:53:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome!!
