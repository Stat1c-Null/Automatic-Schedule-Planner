The weekly work is easy. The tests are lockdown. He claims its on the first 2 sentences of every paragraph in tested chapters (30+ pages)(not helpful). He thinks its funny that he doesn't give guidance for a required class. Pretty disrespectful.

His video lectures were way too long and usually had nothing to do with the test. Your grade is dictated by your performance on exams but he doesn't give you any resources to help you prepare for them. Its honestly comical that he refers to himself as a proffesor.

This was a pretty easy class to take online. He gives a crossword puzzle and a 5 question quiz every week and 3 discussion boards throughout the semester.

The lectures were extremely boring and your grade was pretty much decided by a few tests. I love history and this class was tedious and difficult for me.

It's a better use of your time. I think some parts of the world use videos of his lectures as punishment.   Avoid this class at all costs. He's a miserable person who hates being there, and it shows.

His lectures are pointless but you're required to come. Sometimes he reads directly out of the textbook for the entire class. I feel like I haven't learned anything. He makes his class much more difficult than it should be. He isn't clear what's on the tests and they're over 4-5 chapters at a time, so they're very hard.
