His grading is straightforward, and questions can be worded a bit difficultly. He gives a lot of content to read but it is a lot to help you understand so if you're not big on reading too much I don't recommend but I mean its history, reading is bound to happen. The content he gives relates heavily to quizzes and tests.

The class is set up to be so easy to succeed, the materials we read are well picked, and Prof. Hogan is so kind! He has always responded to my emails quickly, thoroughly explains subjects each week, very supportive. You can tell he loves what he does.

A discussion post is due every week on Friday (use his written lectures posted on D2L as a guide). Bi-weekly quiz with ten questions, and he provides a study guide.
