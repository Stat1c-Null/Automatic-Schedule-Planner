The content is not too incredibly difficult and this class is a relatively easy A. He is a slow grader though, so beware of that!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzE2NTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2022-08-10 05:07:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"We were graded all on things we did in writing that we had plenty of time to work on. He's a really nice guy who is easy to talk to. The only issue was that he was kind of slow on grading, but he's very fair so it isn't much to worry about. He does take attendance and class will be let out early when you finish early, which is pretty frequent.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTc2MjU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2022-05-05 18:40:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a cool dude, you don't have to go to class but you should. Easy grader, he's very understanding and answers emails really fast. Cool to talk to too, this class was easy and I learned a lot. There are a few opinion based reading responses, two or three papers, and you get a week to take the midterm and final, open note.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjU0NjM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2022-04-25 20:38:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Wright is an amazing teacher if you're looking to take History 1112. He is extremely nice and caring about how you do in class, and is a good grader. Attendance is mandatory, but lectures aren't draining. Write/Type down everything on PowerPoints and you'll do 100% on test. He is writing heavy but he's given the class 2 week extensions.

Always gives feedback on assignments and constantly gives reminders for deadlines. Attendance is required. Class ends early if we finish what we need to talk about, unlike others. Doesn't give out any unnecessary work, just the right amount to where you can tell it's helping your learning.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTU5NTg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
