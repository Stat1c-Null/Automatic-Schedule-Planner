Attendance is mandatory, miss up to 4 lectures and points will be deduced (don't leave early). Insanely boring lectures. Attempts to have a class discussion. Weekly quizzes, 4 essays (Do not use AI, not even Grammarly). Begs for \"creativity\" but the rubric has sparse details. He yells a lot and says *historical* terms.

Info was pretty organized online and in textbook. Likes to talk a lot in online lectures. ALOT OF WRITING. If you don't like to write I don't recommend. The class was actually kind of difficult for an online class. If you just do your work every week and turn stuff in on time you should be fine. Also don't use AI.

His course was laid out very bizarrely, and the few interactions I did have with him, he behaved very strangely and unprofessional towards me. I urge anyone to seek out a better professor, so you do not have to suffer through this class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDgwNzM4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2024-01-27 03:47:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor don't do lockdown.  But the class was very hard.  A lot of work.  quizzes are difficult, very short time to answer quizzes.  in d2l the class is organized in a difficult weird way.  i dont recommend this professor.   \n","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTI5MzQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
