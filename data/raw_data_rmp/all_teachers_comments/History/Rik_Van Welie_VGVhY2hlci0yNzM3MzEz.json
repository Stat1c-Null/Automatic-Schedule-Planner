He is not clear on what he wants paper wise. He doesn't give a lot of homework and gave like 3 test, 2 being the midterm and final which makes it hard for one to levy their grade. Show up to lectures and speak, it'll give you cool points. He knows his stuff though!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzA0MDk0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-12-12 18:11:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a very nice guy but his class was terrible. All lecture based and never would finish during the class time because he talks a lot. The final was 40 short answer when we were told it would be multiple choice. He grades hard on the writings you have to do.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDgzMzE4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-12-09 17:06:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was his first semester so I understand why there were some bumps, but he was an extremely difficult professor. We werent prepared for exams, he constantly changed the syllabus and schedule, he assigned a lot of textbook reading, and treated us like children. The final exam was 40 short answer questions, it took me 3 hours to complete 30.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDM4Nzc2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-12-08 21:34:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Sweet guy, but is not the best professor. His class is strictly lecture. You do an assignment and wont receive your grade until weeks after. My class took the final and he said it would be multiple choice. It ended being 40 questions of written responses with three answers to each question. Didnt prepare us well enough. I do not recommend.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDI0NDIz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-11-15 16:29:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Van Welie is a great professor! He is truly passionate about American history but can expect a lot from his students. There is about 15 pages of reading to do between each class which isn't hard but can be tedious. It is also hard to understand what exactly he wants us to study for exams. Long grader, but often gives good feedback.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjQwMzQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
