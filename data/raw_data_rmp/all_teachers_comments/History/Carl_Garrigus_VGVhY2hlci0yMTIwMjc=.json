If you go to class, engage with him and show that you are genuinely interested you will do fine. See him in office hours and put in the effort and he will make sure you get the grade you deserve.

Of course you have to attend class, read some stories, and takes tests but he gives you 3 different types of test you get to choose from and he makes the subject extremely interesting! The test I chose was a group format so get in a good, talkative group! I would reccomend him, 1 of the best @ KSU!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NjU5NTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2008-05-13 09:29:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class online at GPC.

I don't think he even read tests/essays-no feedback, just an arbitrary numerical grade on papers.

I did, however, enjoy the class as Professor Garrigus lectured in a way that made the material seem interesting.

Works out of an anthology of sorts with different writings.  Very different grading style, you chose based on how you work best between essay, multi-choise, class/group participation, or research paper.

He's informative and funny.  He brings in the economic and social sides to history.  He answers questions during lectures.  However, he is woefully unclear in his expectations on the discussion assignments, wants you to do a deep analysis in an hour, uses just a document reader, and seems unwilling to help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNDkyODky","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2006-11-22 12:40:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed this class.
