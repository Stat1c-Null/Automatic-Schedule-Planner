But, on the other hand, now I can date him, I hope he still lives in the area.  I was going to tell everybody to take his world history class, because he is awesome and smart and sweet and cute, but too bad for you he's gone.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzkxNjc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-01-05 20:36:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super nice guy, so behave yourself. The assignments and quizzes aren't difficult. His exams are a bit harder, but he drops your lowest score and will provide you with plenty of opportunities to earn extra credit. His lectures can be a bit dry at times, but he tries to make history as interesting as possible. Buy the book and attend class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5Njc3MDAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST101","date_posted":"2012-01-05 00:45:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor McClymont has one of those voices that lingers ( familiar, gentle, steady) in your memory, not just for hours or weeks, but indelibly.  The past rushes forward as he summons it, and yet all I could think about was the present ( him standing there in his sweater and jeans) He has no idea the effect he has; I learned lots, but yearned more","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NjcxNjI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2011-12-12 13:39:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take attendance only a few times during the semester. Drop the lowest exam. His lectures are a bit boring but nonetheless you will learn a lot in this class. There are a few map quizzes, which are an easy A or B.

He is young and graduated from KSU, so he can easily relate to students. He is VERY helpful and understanding if you contact him. Go to class, he'll give out test questions and powerpoints.

His accent makes his lectures even better..ladies!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjIzNDU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2011-11-10 15:06:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"He reads from his power point notes, which are really long. He doesn't really connect with the class, which is why it is hard to stay focused. He does require for the majority of the class to be present because he posts both the power points and his notes online. Read the notes a couple times and do review sheets, you will do fine. No book needed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjA5NDY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2011-11-04 16:07:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Everything in this class is easy except the tests. You really have to study his powerpoints to do well on them. His class is pretty boring because he just lectures from powerpoints the whole time, but he usually lets the class out a little early. You don't necessarily need the book, but it'd help. This class isn't bad, but be prepared to study.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTY0MDU3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2011-05-17 21:14:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"TAKE THIS CLASS! Prof McClymont is extremely helpful and a lot of fun. His accent is awesome!! He is very good at what he does and is very clear.

You learn a lot, but he makes it interesting. He obviously knows his subject well. He is quick to respond to emails. He is friendly. You can earn bonus points on the tests and map quizzes.
