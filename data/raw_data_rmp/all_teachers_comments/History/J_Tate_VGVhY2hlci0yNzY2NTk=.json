He's smart, witty, and full of interesting stories. Be warned, the tests were all essay (not as bad as it sounds). The text was a collection of speeches and documents which was much more interesting than a traditional text would have been.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTQ5OTI4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2007-08-09 14:47:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is worth taking even if it isn't required(which i think it is) I absolutely loved the stories and his way of teaching.

I hate lectures but he has a good sense of humor and really knows his stuff, it's like taking history with your grandpa.

However, he doesn't use a text book, and unless you know a lot about Hist, GET A BOOK!  His tests were crazy!  There were questions on the test that we never went over in class. And I never missed a day. Read everything you can, as well as take notes, and you will do fine. 3 tsts and 4 quizes.

One of the best that I've had at KSU. Take good notes and you will do well in his class. His stories are very entertaining.

Make sure you come to class because he does not use a book, and don't show up late because he gets pretty irritated. Everything comes from his mind. His exams are very hard, so make sure you study really hard. There are 3 document test which means you read about 10 passages and answer questions about them.

Hist.  WONDERFUL teacher.  Amusing and easy to listen to.  Tests aren't easy, but they're not impossible.  Make sure you read everything he gives you, though, as he does give tests on *just* the reading material as well as tests on his lectures.
