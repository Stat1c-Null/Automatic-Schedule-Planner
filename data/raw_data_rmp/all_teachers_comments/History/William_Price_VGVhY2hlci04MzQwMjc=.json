This professor expects you to be able to critically think, and his tests are mostly essay-based. If you go to class and pay attention, do the readings, and form actual, fact-based opinions, you'll be fine. If you do well on the first 2 tests, you can skip the final.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTI1NzIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2011-05-02 01:20:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gives three essay tests with the highest two of the three being your grade, that's it.
