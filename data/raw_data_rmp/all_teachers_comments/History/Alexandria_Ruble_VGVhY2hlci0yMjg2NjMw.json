She does make you talk to other people unfortunately. I wish I could take my other history classes with her. It's a very big class so I was shocked that she knew my name. You will have reading assignments pretty much every day. You will have a midterm and final exam and a paper.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDM3NjI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2018-01-10 21:59:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class is very lecture heavy, but her passion for what she is teaching makes it interesting and engaging. She is very accessible for office hours and offers extra credit. Everything you need to know for exams is on the powerpoints, however, the textbook is very useful for the one paper she assigns and to clarify things not clear in powerpoints.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDMyODAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2018-01-09 06:40:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was definitely not the easiest I have ever taken however, it is possible to do.

I usually make all A's but she is one of the toughest graders, not one A. Takes attendance, very lecture heavy, &amp; incredibly boring/dense; you'll never want to come to class. She's new as a professor so that may be why. Only good quality I would say was she's passionate about the subject.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDA0NzQ2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Tests are tough--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2017-12-29 21:57:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Ruble is a very sweet professor who will work with you. Her class is broken down into 4 grades: attendance, midterm, paper, and final, each being worth 25%. She is a very tough paper grader and grades you as if you were a historian BUT her class is doable.

She is very smart and will lecture for an hour at least, but it really is an easy class. Notes are not necessary, all I did was show up, sign my name on attendance, then listen to music or watch Netflix until she dismissed us and made a B in the class.
