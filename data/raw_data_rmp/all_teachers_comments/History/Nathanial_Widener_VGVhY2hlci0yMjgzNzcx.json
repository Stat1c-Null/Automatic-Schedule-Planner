He allowed us to do group assignments for a quiz grade (they were easy), his lectures were pretty engaging because he was funny, and I felt like I actually learned something even though it was a history class. Definitely recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzk3ODg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2018-04-26 13:27:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Midterm and Final that's it. You write down your name on a piece of paper and turn it in for attendance every day. Super lecture heavy and lectures to nearly the last second of class. Towards the beginning of the semester, there were weekly required camera and lockdown browser. Midterm and final are online and an all-day thing.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTAyOTE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He gives you 3 chances to take the multiple choice, and you have to write a few free responses and 1 essay. However, you have all day to do it and he grades super easy!! You have a few quizzes and papers as well. He is always looking to give extra credit!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODYzMDYw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Hilarious--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
