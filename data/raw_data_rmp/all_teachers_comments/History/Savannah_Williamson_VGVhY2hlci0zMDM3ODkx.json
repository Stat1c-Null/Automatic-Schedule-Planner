She was MIA the entire semester, and didn't give any grading criteria, requirements, or guidance on how to do the essays? The midterm was the worst; it was very heavy and confusing. The final essay wasn't bad, but the group video project was challenging because it's an online class. I don't recommend her class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTM4Njgz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2025-07-07 23:52:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Horrible but sweet! She doesn't grade anything for weeks, and this is an 8-week course for summer. The first 5 weeks we have no idea what our grade was! Midterm essay was divided in 2 parts and had to use I think, 5 sources. The final essay you have to work in groups and use 8 sources+video if you work alone it will be 13 sources! Which is absurd.

Barely gave feedback to help us. There are discussion posts every week, the textbook is free. midterm is an essay and final is an essay and group video project.
