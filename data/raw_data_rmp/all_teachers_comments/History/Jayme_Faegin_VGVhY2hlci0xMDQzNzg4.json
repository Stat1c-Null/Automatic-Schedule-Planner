However, the coureswork consists of two tests only. This means that you're tested on over two centuries worth of info, and they each count 25%. Overall, I would recommend her - the coursework is manageable, but the tests are high-stakes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MzgzNzc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2008-01-09 23:42:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"overall a great class.  this class if how you would picture a college course.  she is very smart, very clear, and overall a good teacher.  i took notes on everything she said and didn't read the book and came out with an a.  go to class and take as many notes as possible and you should be fine!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzOTc0NTY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2007-12-04 22:11:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice prof who went out of her way to help the class after the first exam.

Kinda boring. Needs to improve teaching style. She isn't that loud so sit up close or you'll fall asleep. Write EVERYTHING she says, and read the book right after class. Half the class failed the 1st tesy, but she was nice enough to give xtra credit.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTYzMTY3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
