Just sit back, break out a bottle of brandy, light a fire, and listen to the tales that are, ahhhh World Civilization. Barrow has an uncanny affinity for all things history and politics. Loved his class. He is a character. Attendance is mandatory, show up late he'll make fun of you; hilarious!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTQ0NzQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2009-05-19 16:07:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"A very funny teacher due to his accent and tendency to go off subject and talk about something else. All of my assignments with him were take home so its a very easy course. This also means that there is probably no point in taking any notes, although attendance is a percentage of your grade. The classes can get very boring despite his personality.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODY3NDM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2009-05-04 19:55:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Barrow is very knowledgable, and extremely funny.  His African accent takes a little getting used to.  Only complaint is he reads straight from the book, don't think about taking notes.  Exams are take home, and must be extremely detailed but questions are easy.  Recommended for those who don't mind old school lectures with humor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NzYyNTcy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3401","date_posted":"2007-08-07 10:53:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best teacher at this school.
