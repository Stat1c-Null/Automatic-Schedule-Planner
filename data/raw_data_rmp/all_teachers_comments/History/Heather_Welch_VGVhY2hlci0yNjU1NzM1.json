She does use lockdown browser for her tests so you will have to study but she gives a kahoot with 15 of the 25 multiple choice questions from the test. Class was two, one page papers, and 3 tests. I only went to class in person 3 times and got an A. I just studied the week of the test.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Nzc1NTg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2021-01-13 00:53:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I highly recommend taking this history class with Professor Welch! This class is not a breeze through you will have to put effort into studying. Although Professor Welch gives all the necessary resources to do well on tests. I would recommend this class to anyone that is well structured and accountable in their study habits.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjY5NjA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2021-01-10 18:11:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"A great teacher would take her class again! She heavily prepares you in your materials to make As on her test. If you focus on the study material given and fill it out correctly you will be well prepared. I would recommend this class!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjU5NTYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2020-12-16 23:34:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class consists mostly of weekly responses, 3 tests, and a paper. Her responses are not easy grades, but its not hard to get 100s (just closely follow her instructions). The final paper was easy, only 2 pages, on a topic of your choosing. She holds review sessions before the tests.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTA5MjM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
