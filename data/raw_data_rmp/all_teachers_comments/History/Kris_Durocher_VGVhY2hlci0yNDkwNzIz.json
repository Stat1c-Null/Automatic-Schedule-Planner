I needed help one time throughout the semester, and she said though luck to me. Absolutely not. Plus, the exams are in person on paper. No extra credit and honestly, the WORST professor I've ever had. VERY BAD! Please trust me and do not.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTA2MDQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2024-10-23 17:45:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Durocher was honestly a relatively good professor, considering it was a 300 person lecture hall. The information is readily available and posted on d2l, however the lectures are long and start to drone. Attendance is mandatory, but you can miss 2 classes with no penalty and she's great at responding to emails if you need an absence excused.

The class was a 3 hour long lecture once a week. She makes powerpoint slides that didn't explain the whole concepts. Her tests are very specific and dumb, and no study guide. The questions in the reading quizzes are misleading, and she offers no extra credit. You are better off taking history online!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODE0OTEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2024-09-05 18:23:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"I actually cannot stand this lady. It was a 3 hour long history class and yet somehow she would still manage to yap after the time was over. No study guides, reading quizzes every week, and slideshows don't even explain all the content.

She comes off as nice at first but shes not. Boring lecture class. Tries to be relatable but sucks. Gives weekly reading quizzes that are very misleading and are only 5 questions. She assigns so many papers... if I wanted to take English I would. Do not take as gen ed. Good for a higher level History class.
