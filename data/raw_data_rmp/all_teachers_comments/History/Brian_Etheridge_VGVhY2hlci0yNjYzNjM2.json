The class itself is easy as long as you participate, but Professor Etheridge made it more enjoyable. Attendance matters heavily, but we only met once a week so don't forget!

I love sitting, watching the lectures, and really just thinking. He'll mention philosophy and rumors and that really keeps you interested during his lectures, and in the end makes you learn the material better.

But only take him if you can handle the pressure. He will push you hard in the Research Seminar and constantly challenge you to improve your work. It can be overwhelming for sure. Take him if you want to legitimately improve at your work.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODE3ODQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
