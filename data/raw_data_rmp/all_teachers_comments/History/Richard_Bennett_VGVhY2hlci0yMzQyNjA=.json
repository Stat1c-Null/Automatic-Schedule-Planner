Mostly an online course, you just read a word document he sends and answer 1-3 questions. The confusing part is the group project, basically no guidelines but 30% of your grade. Nobody knows what he expects from the group.

Knocks off major points if you miss class. No textbook, everything is done through a &quot;review&quot; that he gives through webct. He gives a study guide with terms.
