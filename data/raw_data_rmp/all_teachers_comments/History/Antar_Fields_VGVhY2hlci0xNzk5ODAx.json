Worse mistake ever. Don't bother buying the book, he'll take points off if used in your essays. His test are multiple choice then a essay. I would always ace the multiple choice, never got credit on the essay (I'm a English major). One day during an exam, I had enough.

Avoid this professor at all costs. You basically have 2 grades in this class because the quizzes and \"pop quizzes\" barely budge your grade.
