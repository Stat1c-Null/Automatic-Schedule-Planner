Research paper is typical history style, as it does not leave a lot of direction to work with.  This class is core curriculum, but I will also be taking his 2111 for History Majors because I think that he is quite a good teacher, and he leaves you well prepared for his tests.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NjIzMjQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2009-03-28 15:02:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice teacher. Class is not too hard but be prepared- you have a quiz almost every class of 5-10 questions or maps but he lets you drop a couple of your lowest.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTc4NzEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
