The class is a easy A if you show up to class and take notes. He post lecture notes on D2L prior to class. You'll just need to add filler notes as he elaborates on each topic. 4 test in all. The 4th test is the final. Easy class to receive an A in.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njg5MTQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2017-12-05 11:02:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Didn't open the book at all. Fairly sure attendance wasn't required, but if you want to pass you need to listen to the lectures. Professor Drews is amazing. Best history class I've ever taken.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDQ1MTYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures--Would take again","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2017-11-16 01:07:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Drews is a great guy, and hes really understanding of personal situations. The entire class is made up of 4 tests and nothing else. Theres no final, just another test. He posts all of the notes online but leaves things out that youll only get if you go to class. Im not a history fan but this class was great for me.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTEyNDMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2013-01-07 22:07:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed his class. Very simple setup of class: come to class, take notes, multiple choice tests. Some might find his class boring, but I really enjoyed it, and I'm not a fan of history.

A really great teacher and makes the subject interesting. He explains what is important to know and why it matters. Grading is quick on the tests and is done fairly.
