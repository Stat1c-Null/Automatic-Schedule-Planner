You are graded by 2 tests where 2 long answers are worth 40 points of your grade. You also have 2 essays, one by yourself and one as a group. Then your only other grade is participation. If you want to earn A's on any of the assignments buckle up.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDIwOTY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-12-08 05:53:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Emphasis on grade by few. just two tests, two papers, and participation. Thisll likely be my only B despite trying &amp; I know a few people with Cs. Participation doesnt have a rubric &amp; those who talk often still dont get 100s unless you know US history like the back of ur hand. He makes history interesting but gpa wise I wouldnt take it again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDEzNzUz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-12-05 20:58:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"First and foremost, he is not clear on whether he wants you to write an argumentative essay or informational essay. He does however grade as if he clearly explained it to you, so be careful. If you're an introvert, you'll have a difficult time in his class. He not only wants you to show up everyday, but he also wants you to speak up and argue.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzczNTky","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-12-03 19:37:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Has a weird sense of humor that doesn't really make any sense and just makes him sound like a jackass to be honest haha.

However, he does a great job making sure he isn't labeled as an easy grader. I dedicated, admittedly, a lot of time into my paper and I still got a B. He only has 2 papers and 2 tests for the semester which is a blessing &amp; curse. Participation really matters so answer his questions so he knows ur voice.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTU5NDAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-10-25 14:45:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's hilarious, very direct and uses humor to strike a point across. He grades very hard, and claims it's the school's guidelines (whatever). But he is an excellent professor. Go to every class and pay attention to his lectures. Everything he says is test material. As far as written portions, good luck. I get As in English, but low Bs for him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTUxODA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-10-17 04:34:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"His grading is bull. Even if you know what you are talking about if you do not tell him in the way he wants then you get a C at best. Even his lectures are a rollercoaster, he goes on tangents that aren't even related to the lectures and you find yourself confused on what to take notes on. He clearly doesn't understand this is a prerequisite class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTMwMzMy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2021-10-15 16:34:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Dyer is a really down to earth guy, and he is a new professor.
