I don't see the point of his teachings in correlation with the tests. It doesn't help that his lectures were super boring an drug out. His PowerPoints/study guide were not very helpful at all either. Glad it was his last year teaching. Wouldn't take again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzIyNzM5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST3305","date_posted":"2019-01-06 21:56:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Voogt is extremely knowledgable, has a great rapport with his class, and is greatly respected.

His classes consist of reading word for word off of a powerpoint that he rarely posted to D2L. His tests are very detailed and contain maybe 10% of what the study guide says to study. Avoid this prof if at all possible.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDU4Nzcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

The tests are mostly over his lectures, so attendance is important. The quizzes are all ten questions and multiple choice, as long as you paid attention and read the chapter, its a breeze. He's a nice guy and he's passionate about the subject. I don't understand why the negativity.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDIxMTUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1111","date_posted":"2018-12-12 14:15:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"The lectures were just so-so, but I don't understand some of the negative comments complaining there were a lot of quizzes and you had to read in order to do well on them.
