We read a book or 20+page article for every class and were then made to have open discussion. No participation resulted in a point off that grade even if you spoke in class, if it &quot;did not contribute meaningfully to the discussion&quot; it did not count. I also never got half the grades back.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDE5NjEx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--SO MANY PAPERS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2017-12-10 12:06:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Gentry is an awesome professor who makes history much easier for students to understand. We had a weekly discussion posts, 3 exams, 2 short papers (that were easy and he literally walks you through), and in class discussions. The class was pretty enjoyable and his lectures are not as dry as most.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTE2NTI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tests?

Gives you a great study guide, although it is a pretty thick study guide. Multiple choice essay tests. Weekly discussion posts. Come to class and easy B, and you will work again.

He has 3 non-cumulative tests, weekly discussion posts, and 2 short papers. He gives you a study guide for the test that gives you all of the multiple choice questions and terms to know. As long as you come to class, take notes, and study it's an easy A.

He assigns a lot of papers, but it's a history class and he's preparing you for being a future historian. Lectures on Tuesdays and discussions on reading on Thursdays. Overall a pretty easy class if you put in the work","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTQ1NDg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

He is very enthusiastic about history and he occasionally has a sense of humor. This course is very lecture heavy and reading heavy like most history classes. He gives really useful study guides for the tests but you have to complete it yourself. Pretty much, if you don't read or show up for the class, you're screwed.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTQ5ODQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Caring--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2017-01-11 20:53:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fairly easy class, weekly online discussions, 1 essay, 2 or 3 tests, and a final. Weekly group discussions online as well as in class. Straight lecture, there's a powerpoint but it's mostly pictures. Take notes and the tests are very easy.
