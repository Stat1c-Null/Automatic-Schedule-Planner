Once we got him to write on the white board from left to right instead of jumping all around it was much easier to keep track of notes. Fun guy but can be a little scattered and unorganized.

He has a Mississippi accent that makes me think of True Blood.  He taught American History like it was story he was telling to children before nap time, but no one wanted to go to sleep.
