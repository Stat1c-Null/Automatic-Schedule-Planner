A couple quizzes over some short readings, her tests are easy IF YOU STUDY. As long as you put in a little bit of effort you will be totally fine, would recommend over and over again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTcxMzU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2006-06-20 12:07:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good story teller!

Tests are standard multiple choice, short answer, essay type tests.  Essays get larger the closer it gets to the end of the semester.  She gives you everything you need for the essays, however.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODk1ODc=","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
