She said multiple times how busy she was and it showed when our midterm still hadnt been graded a day before the semester ended. Lectures are super heavy and you just watch them and read the textbook to do well on quizzes and tests.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzkxOTk4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2021-05-11 21:57:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a great professor who brought new insight from different perspectives. She helped me understand US history in a more interesting way. Her lectures were interesting because of her previous education. Loved learning from her lens and she was very willing to help us and point us in the right direction.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzY4MDI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2021-05-05 18:18:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Grace is a great professor and her online lectures are so funny and enjoyable to watch. theres about 3 hours of content to watch/read each week with a quiz at the end and an occasional discussion board. the only tests we had were a midterm with an essay part and a final. she posted some content late but usually gives an extension if she does.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzEyOTE4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures--Hilarious--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2021-05-04 19:16:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Highly recommend. She is a bit unorganized, but she is really really nice, and super forgiving. Her lectures are interesting and fun, and the class overall was enjoyable.

She's easy-going, very funny, and her lectures are easy to listen to. Quite a lot of assignments, but they're easy to keep up with. I never wanted to miss any class because she made it so fun. The only criticism I have is that she takes a while to grade assignments, but other than that, she's awesome!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njc3NTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2111","date_posted":"2021-04-16 13:26:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Watkinson (goes by Dr. Grace) is very unorganized.

You'll have a weekly quiz based on lectures and reading, as well as a biweekly discussion post which is pretty easy.
