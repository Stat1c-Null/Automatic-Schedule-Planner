Every lecture was super entertaining, as I feel like we often talked about aspects of US history that get overlooked. We had two short essays and three exams, which were all straight-forward and quite easy.

He gives two essays and two to three tests, plus a final,, but they are all very easy. The tests consist of terms that you select 3-4 and define them, but they are all pretty easy to learn and remember. There is an essay-style question, but there are only one or two paragraphs that are all easy to study for.

Doesn't care if you are shy, he expects you to speak up. Is a harsh grader. Said that a sentence was confusing without explanation. Is very unorganized and is switching things up.

Attendance is technically graded for 10pts but he's lenient with it you'll really only lose all 10 if you never go to class. He definitely prepares you to get 100's on the 3 exams and offers feedback on the 3 papers to get A's there too. Easy A with nice prof would take again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNjMyNjI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2112","date_posted":"2025-01-03 05:44:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"This course is very easy.

The \"textbook\" is an online website, which is great! Class has 2 essays, 3 exams, and attendance is mandatory or else your grade is dropped a letter.
