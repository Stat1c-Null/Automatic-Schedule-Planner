He is very knowledgeable on how to teach but nothing is organized. It is impossible to work ahead on big projects as he changes up every assignment last minute and gave the rubric on the day before, combined with assigning WAY too much compared to the other professors who teach the same class.

Assignments weren't overly difficult, but he nitpicks everything! About half of the class was spent on a project with a lesson plan produced at the end, but we didn't spend much time working on how to make them. Also, he tends to be unstructured, indirect, and rude. Not unbearable but not fun.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTM3NDIy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST3100","date_posted":"2020-12-17 23:42:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best professor ever.

I took it online over the summer and I was totally impressed and satisfied with the course. No tests. A midterm essay and a final essay. Dr. Okie is EXTREMELY knowledgeable, caring, and helpful.

Before his class, I had never received above a B in history, and he made history so fun.
