Not very understanding to student situational matters. She will not record and post lectures. Offers 5-6 missed attendance passes. Participation is part of grade. Expect atleast 2 midterms....  face to face teacher but online due to COVID","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzQ4OTA3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
