No attendance policy but being in class helps with the exams.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjU5MTM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2013-01-16 21:21:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Decent professor. Uses powerpoints with vague bullets and expands on them through lecture. Really nice! Test are kind of difficult. No study guide, but a lot of information covered in between test. Assigns 2 test, 4 map quizzes, a written response, and a final. Easy B!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjY4NTcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1101","date_posted":"2012-12-13 17:25:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor and very knowledgeable about the subject. Not rude or condescending and is always there to help if you need it. He gives you the essay questions for the test in advance so you have to be pretty dumb to do poorly in his class. Would reccomend. Kind of a cutie too!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDU5MTI3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1110","date_posted":"2012-12-05 10:34:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher was very difficult! I will Not take this class with him ever! All he does is read from power points. you take notes then the class is dismissed! Every day you are on a new chapter. He teaches too FAST! There are no group projects or interactions with other students! So good luck to you that have to take him!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTU2MTMw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
