He is very chill when it comes to grading and he is also probably the most understanding professor i've had. He cares about all of his students well-being over homework or things related to school. There are 4 essays with easy prompts, and group assignments are easy too","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzE5NjU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2022-12-19 03:00:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Sillitti is the best. He only assigned 4 essays and a few group projects that were super easy. He's not a harsh grader at all and he is very caring and does great with engaging with his students. Sometimes the lessons can be boring, but it's not a hard class at all. I highly recommend taking his class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTgzODc3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST1112","date_posted":"2022-11-07 01:10:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is SO SWEET and you are graded by 4 essays.

Class is low effort. 4 essays (you choose prompts & it's easy) with extra credit. Very caring of his students and accessible outside of class. He personally greets and speaks to every student. 3 excused absences but understanding. Textbook required but not hard reading. Goes over in class with PowerPoint, but I barely take notes.
