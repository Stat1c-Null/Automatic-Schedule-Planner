He talks about America as if we are the worst country, by only highlighting the worst parts of our history and even when he does talk about our good achievements he relates them to selfish intentions. He needs to stop talking about his opinions and just teach the course.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzQ1OTMy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things--Test heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2019-12-22 21:22:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good lectures, very conversational. He's funny and very knowledgable, but pop quizzes are important and harder to predict than you think. He gives 10 and drops the lowest two though. He likes participation, and you need to read to do that well, but he uses the free American Yawp textbook so don't buy anything.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzQ0OTQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
