Gives outlines for notes which helps studying for tests. Six writing assignments that take some time but she only takes the 4 highest grades so I only did 4. Pay attention and study and you will make an A!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMzMxOTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2014-05-09 11:53:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"AMAZING Professor!  She is easy to follow and take notes from and though you will need to study hard for her tests, the test material is EXACTLY what she teaches and what you write down so studying is easy and productive.  She is also very responsive, nice and obviously knows what she's talking about.

As long as you pay attention in class, take good notes and STUDY there is no reason you should not pass with flying colors.

No homework or quizzes.There are a few one-page essays, but two with lowest grades are dropped. Tests are easy if you study, focuses more on people & concepts, rather than dates. Posts an outline for note taking before every class. Very helpful & understanding. Almost always ends early! Definitely recommend!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDUzOTYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2112","date_posted":"2013-05-07 23:42:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"ALL ESSAY EXAMS INCLUDING THE CUMULATIVE FINAL.
