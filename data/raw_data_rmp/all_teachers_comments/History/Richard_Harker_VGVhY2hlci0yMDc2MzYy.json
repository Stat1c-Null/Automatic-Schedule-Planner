He talks really fast during his lectures and he covers so much material but I didn't really mind it. He was very thorough.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDQ4OTEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2016-01-11 11:42:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"He made US History entertaining and made me want to show up to class. Group discussions happen almost every class, so bring your book/materials. He provided feedback for every assignment and is willing to help prepare you for everything, but you still will have to work for your grades. He isn't 100% easy, but not impossible.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTE3Mjk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2015-12-18 01:56:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Probably the best history professor you could ever get. His energy and attitude is constantly positive, he strives to ensure everyone is doing successful in the class as well as explains subjects specifically. Assignments are fairly easy, But be prepared to speak a lot in this class through group discussions and projects.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NzU1OTcx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
