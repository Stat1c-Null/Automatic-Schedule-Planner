She also gives helpful feedback on the assignments, given that you submit on time.

Many in the class were confused by her directions. For example, she said in the syllabus that discussion posts are for a grade, but then in a Skype session she said to only do them if they help you (She did end up grading them in the end.) Get ready to email your classmates a ton for clarification.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMTI4ODE3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDRS8000","date_posted":"2015-03-22 21:25:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Knows so much.
