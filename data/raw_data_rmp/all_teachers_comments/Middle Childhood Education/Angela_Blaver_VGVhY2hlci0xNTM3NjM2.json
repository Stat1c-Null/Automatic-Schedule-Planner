She was very nice and relaxed teacher which was perfect for the first EDUC class. Her lessons are discussion based and she gives two weeks for every assignment.

Dr. Blaver was helpful and willing to accommodate you with  the assignments  depending on your circumstances. She did not respond to emails in a reasonable time frame. The assignments were fairly easy, but there were times the directions were vague.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzg2NTYx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
