She has a passion for law and is able to break down the law in such a simplistic way. The test are not bad,but make sure you study. Extra credit was provided which is always a plus. I would suggest you take this professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzMxMjM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2009-08-16 10:21:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not a bad class for a required course. Prof. Dutcher obviously has a passion for her subject matter, which was just interesting to me.  Tests were tough, but Prof. Dutcher was generous with extra credit and outside class help if you asked for it.  I recommend her class, just be sure to study for the tests,  her lecture notes are great for that.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MTI0NTM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2008-12-28 12:00:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"It was quite obvious that it was Prof. Dutcher's first year teaching.  She really appeared to have no idea how to run a class.  Assignments were few, but her tests were very unclear. We did not use to book other than for the Case writing assignment. She sent out reviews for tests, but questions on test were too vague and she was not helpful.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Mjg3MTk2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
