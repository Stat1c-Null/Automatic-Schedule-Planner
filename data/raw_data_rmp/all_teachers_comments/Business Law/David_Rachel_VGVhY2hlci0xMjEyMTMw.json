His class is fun, engaging, and hysterical.  He follows the book exactly.  All you have to to is read and pay attention in class and you will get a good grade.  A couple of online assignments. Simple.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzcyOTU4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2010-11-04 15:09:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"I was in his class for 2 days and dropped. He is very intimidating. He can be funny, but kind of rude. Gave us a graded textbook quiz on the 2nd day, but all he talked about on the first day was the 8 parts of speech (which has nothing to do with BLAW). I decided to drop when he forced a student who had added his class the 2nd day to take the quiz.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzI4MzMz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2010-08-11 19:51:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"It was pretty bad...","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTAyOTEy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2009-10-28 21:10:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Rachel is not the most experienced attorney in the world, but he is very engaging and as thorough as the class wants him to be.  The tests are quite hard unless you have the companion study guide.  This teacher involves the class and makes it fun to learn law.  I am actually considering minoring in law thanks to him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mjg1MTU1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2009-05-05 20:55:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not sure what happened in this class...  Took it online - not the best experience.  The class is an easy &quot;A&quot; if you just do the work.  Quizzes were sporadic and followed the textbook.  I wanted to do so much more!  We were so far behind at the end we took four quizzes in a week.  This is a better class to take in person if you want to be engaged.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NzcxOTA4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2100","date_posted":"2008-11-20 14:22:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor I have ever had. He is disorganized and does not teach the material well in my opinion. He gives unannounced quizzes over material that he has not taught yet. You are basically expected to learn the material on you own. My recommendation, avoid this professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MDM0ODY0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
