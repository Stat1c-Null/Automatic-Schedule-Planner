She is very caring and understanding if you are injured. Really gets your heartrate up in class. She'll go back and review parts of dances/break them down if you're struggling.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTU5NDEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
