All tests are take-home & online & he gives you 3-4 days to complete. If you go to class, you're going to hear him reading slides to you. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Buy the book. The slides are simply reviews of the chapter. Lots of material!! Study.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDEwMjIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2010-11-14 04:13:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Boring lectures, dont remember going to class a whole lot.

It seems like a large portion of what he talks about in class is not even on the tests, but he implemented extra credit just for coming.

He offers TONS of extra credit. He understands that this class is dry and wants his students to make a good grade. He had 3 tests and they all were open book and open note.
