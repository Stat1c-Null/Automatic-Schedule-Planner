Not much studying is required because the exams are open note and she sends out a study guide the night before with all of the concepts needed. She never responds to emails!!

Attendance isn't mandatory, but she will take it if there are not a lot of students in class and count it as extra credit. Her lectures are just her reading the textbook. Her tests are all open note and you have the whole day to take them online. She also gives you multiple attempts on the homework.

TONS. Tests are online, (Lockdown w/ Webcam) and are extremely long with 5 multiple choice answers (ie. ABCDE). And the answers are meant to trick you. They're hard. She is rude if you seek help, and ISNT REACHABLE. She barely responds via email The only thing giving her a 2 is the lenient grade policy she has.

Make sure to study the textbook for the tests, her powerpoints will not be enough. We only get two homework assignments each week so it's not a terrible amount of homework. Tip; read the textbook and create a quizlet with terms as you read, this has been key to pass.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTY0OTQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
