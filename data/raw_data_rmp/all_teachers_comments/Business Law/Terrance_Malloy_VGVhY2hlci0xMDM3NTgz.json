All test consist of 75 questions, and the week of an exam you have to read the following chapter and create a lengthy discussion thread. He has a huge ego that prevents him from doing his job and that's teaching. He lacks compassion for nontradional students and is unreasonable when it comes to grading.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NzQyOTY2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2010-12-03 17:00:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"very straight forward class. if you follow the syllabus you will do well in the class","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODU0OTUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2009-12-05 09:46:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Read the book and ignore the lectures you will pass the class.
