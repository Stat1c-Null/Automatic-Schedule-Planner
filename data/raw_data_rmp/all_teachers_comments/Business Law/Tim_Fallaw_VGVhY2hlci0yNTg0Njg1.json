He has extensive knowledge about the subject. Lectures are dense but the powerpoint helps a lot. DEFINITELY READ THE BOOK. That made a dramatic difference in my test results.

Lectures are straight from the PowerPoints, and hes super dry and bland. There are 5/6 tests AND a final. Weekly LearnSmarts due that he refuses to let you make up unless youre dying with proof.
