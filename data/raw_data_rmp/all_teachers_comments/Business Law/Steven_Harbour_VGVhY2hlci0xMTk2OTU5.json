The class was really interesting. All of the tests are open book/ open note, so they were really easy.

Lots of examples. You have to read. Open notes for the test but still difficult. Learned ALOT. Take him if he doesn't retire.

So going to class and listening is important! The book is helpful if you actually read it.  Yes, tests are a bit hard but it's college people. Tests are open book, open note, open laptop, and he does curve tests. Made an A in the class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTE5MTMx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2010-05-03 12:56:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome professor! Test are difficult so study the material multiple times before the test, even though open book/note/laptop. Hard to focus, helps if you sit close and actively engage by taking notes. He is very nice, and tries to make it as interesting as possible. You will learn alot. Best if you sit in front. Don't sleep.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTA4MzI0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2010-04-28 14:28:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Even though tests are open book/note/computer, they are extremely hard.

I did decently and I still say don't take him. He's wicked incomprehensible and boring. Tests are open note/book/laptop but are still extremely difficult because they're situational and require obscure application of principles. Paper's an easy A, but test averages were always below a 75 and he doesn't often curve. 1-time bonus for 15pts","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDM5MTcy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2009-11-21 18:35:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly, Business law is not the most interesting class, but Professor Harbour tried his best to make class interesting.

He's an attorney, so he has a lot of hands-on experience to share and that helps alot with the subject matter.
