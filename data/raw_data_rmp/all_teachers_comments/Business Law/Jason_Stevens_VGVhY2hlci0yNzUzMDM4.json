Attendance is mandatory as he passes out an attendance sheet at the beginning of each class but I missed two sessions and still received a 100 for attendance. His quizzes and tests are lecture depending so make sure you go! Overall very entertaining lectures!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzY1Mzgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2021-12-14 18:55:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor who gives real life stories as examples in class since he is an actual attorney. You won't be punished for skipping class but I recommend to go because you get attendance points, tons of extra credit, and understand the material better. Exams are online and open note on D2L. Easy weekly online hw assignments.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTIwMjgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
