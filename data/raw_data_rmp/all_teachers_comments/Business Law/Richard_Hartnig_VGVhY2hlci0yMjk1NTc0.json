Practiced as an attorney for most of his career, so he really knows his stuff and is able to explain concepts very well. Gives real world examples that make the content easy to digest.

There are also roughly 15 Connect assignments but he makes them all due the day before the final. Tests are open laptop. Attendance not necessary.

He's willing to work with you for the grade you want. You'll have three tests, learn smart assignments, and a written assignment. On the test you're allowed to use your laptop and he basically gives you the answers to the written assignment.

He is a fair grader and gives you all that you need to know in class. There are a few tests and a final, and he has a review day for each test.

It's an easy A, but that doesn't mean you don't learn. I definitely learned a lot reading through and answering the questions.
