He takes his time and asks regularly if the class really understands what he is teaching. If you're having trouble, he doesn't mind spending time outside of class to teach. Every test and quiz has extra credit, and if you have an A at the end of the semester, you are exempt from the final exam!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTIyODA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2015-11-16 10:53:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am normally a student who is horrible at Math. Professor Habib does not rush through the material and goes over what was covered in the last class which is very helpful if you missed a day. If Professor Habib offered more classes I would be the first one on that list.

He wants his students to pass and explains things until everyone understands. He gives a lot of quizzes but they are simple and he drops your two lowest. Homework can get a little difficult but he is willing to reopen if students had issues with it. Do not need textbook. I would definitely retake him.

I highly recommend to everyone. I'm not the best at math and he made statistics interesting and very easy. Great at explaining topics and helping confused students. There are quizzes almost every week but they are short and easy. 3 tests, not hard, but he can count off for specific things. Just go to class, take notes.

It was his first semester teaching and I thought he did really well. If he ever realized people were confused he would try and reexplain it. Very easy class- three tests, weekly quizzes and online homework. He drops one quiz and gives you a day to redo any homework you missed.

If you have an A average, you don't have to take the final. Nice guy and really laid back. It seems like he's new at teaching and still trying to figure out how he likes to do assignments, but that's not a bad thing because he'll ask his students for their input.
