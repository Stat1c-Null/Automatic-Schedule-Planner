Doesn't use vista, but she does offer an alternative email and talks before & after class. She moves fast if people don't ask questions. The extra credit helps a lot. The homework will help pass the test.

She does not do that great of a job explaining in class and she expects everyone to go to the study sessions but they do not fit in everyones schedule.

Super easy, yet you learn a lot in her class. Helpful when you want her to be, but leaves you alone if you work at your own pace. Homework isn't bad at all, and it prepares you for the tests that are easy as long as you give the slightest amount of effort. Really cool and approachable as well.
