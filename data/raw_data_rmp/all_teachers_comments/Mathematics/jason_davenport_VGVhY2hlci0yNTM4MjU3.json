He is no help, and his tests are so heavily reliant on lockdown. I have taken two tests so far, and both times have had points taken off because of my environment.

Very relient on lockdown browser. Even when I tried to do what he asked he would take 50% off of every test because he didn't like the angle of the way I was sitting. He took 50% because the calculator I was using wasn't right when it was the one listed in the syllabus.

I've had 50% and another 25% off my very first test because I did not have a web cam or proper set up to show my entire environment and desk. You'll be reliant on your own learning besides meeting him outside of lectures.

NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. He requires lockdown browser and webcam for each test, which is typical for an online class. However, he views every students test videos and will take up to 50% off of a test if he does not like the angle of the video. I set up my webcam to show my desk, thighs up, work, face, and more and still \"violated\" the syllabus.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTk4ODAz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2021-05-11 01:23:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Be prepared to teach math on your own most of the time! Tests are on lockdown browser and they are worth A LOT! He was accessible through collab ultra and if you had questions he would gladly help and did example problems. Not many students joined his sessions maybe that's why they struggled so much.

But honestly, this class is fine because it's through ALEKS so he's not really essential for this course. I followed his instructions for the exams and never had an issue.
