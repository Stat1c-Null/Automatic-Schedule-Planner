He is knowledgeable on Calc however he fails at translating it to the students. PPT base lecture that are easy but the HW, QZ, &amp; TST are something else. His syllabus mention that no drop or retakes but we had a retake for everything far. No partial credit, Hard to reach out of class, only 17 people left in class after drop.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTU5ODc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Tough grader--Skip class?

This teacher I particular can teach decently, and what he teaches is on the test but the problem is the test questions are much harder than what we practice on class work. I would highly avoid him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTA3ODky","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He's not very good at explaining simple concepts sometimes. He's a very harsh grader and grades on very minute and small things.
