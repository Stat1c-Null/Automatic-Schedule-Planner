Who wouldn't want a math professor who lets you use a full sheet of paper front and back as a \"cheat sheet\" for the final? (Plus, the final is multiple choice.) The test are easy as long as you understand the material. I'm bad at math and I got an A, you'll do fine too.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjU1NjEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2015-01-07 16:16:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Does not take attendance. Come whenever you want. Puts all the power points online. Never went to class and made a great grade. Her tests are EXACTLY like the study guides just different numbers. Lets you have cheat sheets with formulas. She's honestly great you have to take her!!!!

I'm horrible at math and her tests are okay, there's nothing too hard about them but they notes are critical to pay attention to. 1101 is basically just remembering formulas but I still struggled to understand.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzODUxNjk5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2014-11-18 14:57:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ashley is so chill, easily one of my favorite professors. The class isn't hard at all. All you really have to do is study and you will most likely get an A. I am really bad at math but she made it very understandable.

Attendance is not mandatory and you can do well if you skip (all A's on the tests). If you show your work on tests you will receive almost all credit even if you get the answer wrong.

If you take her for summer semester, be prepared to move quickly. She is always willing to help her students when they ask. There are four tests and be sure to do the online homework; it will benefit you in the end. She also gives extra credit.

Not the case at all. She makes you learn everything pretty much on your own, if you dare ask a question..she acts as if you are pulling her hair out,and she never replies to emails. Also tends to cancel class a lot.

I didn't really use the textbook much. All assignments are due off of webassign and their are reviews and study guides before the tests.
