Most of these reviews are true; he randomly gives pop quizzes. doesn't answer questions clearly, but when it comes to testing, he is a very harsh grader. Tests are not like homework at all.

He was not a good professor at the beginning of the semester, but he listened to student feedback and improved which I can really respect.
