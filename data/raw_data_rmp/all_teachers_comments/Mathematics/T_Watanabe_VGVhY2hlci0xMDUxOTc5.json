There are pop quizzes every other class but as long as you're paying attention you'll be fine. There are exit tickets that are not hard. The material is easy and different than what we learn in elem. so be flexible about learning new methods . Tests are a bit hard so study.

He is helpful and ALWAYS wants his students to understand the material. There are pop quizzes before most classes, but they are super easy if you've been paying attention and he literally goes over what the quiz is on before you take it. 3 tests and a final, which is cumulative. Easy class.

No BUSY WORK, NO USELESS GROUP PROJECTS, AND NO USELESS HOMEWORK!! You need to be motivated to study any material you do not understand yourself.

He gives you a lot of hands-on manipulatives to work with, and they are very cost effective materials you can use in the field.  He gives lots of quizzes and a few writing assignments.

He teaches based on exploration and class activities. If you attend class and take notes and do well on the quizzes, you'll do great in the class.  He uses various supplemental reading material which I recommend, as many quiz questions and test questions came right from the supplemental material.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODAxODA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2008-11-08 11:06:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great professor.  He gives at least ten quizzes throughout the semester.  But he reviews the subject material right before the quiz.  He also gives 8 writing assignments which are pass/fail.  All you have to do is write 2 pages and show an interest and you are set.  The quizzes are a very good review for the exams.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTU4NDEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2008-10-29 14:43:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gives quizes at least once a week, sometimes twice.
