He makes easy concepts very complicated and is down right confusing at times. In lectures, he skips around and doesn't make clear points.

He randomly put Calc II on a test in the Calc I class. If you ask him to explain something, he just points to the board. His test are insane. Do not take this teacher or else you will regret it.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDk2OTIx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2253","date_posted":"2010-04-09 00:42:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is one of the worse teachers in the mathematics department. I  have a 3.8 and I had to withdrawal from his class because it was just ridiculous. He doesn't explain the material and if you ask a question he doesn't answer it but mumbles and points. I wouldn't take him had I known. His accent didn't help it either.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTY5ODUy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2009-12-15 22:29:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"worst professor ever, poor teaching ability and study guides to not mirror exams, hard to understand, knows material but cannot teach it","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTY2ODg0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2253","date_posted":"2009-12-14 22:30:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"don't take him","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTU0ODAy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2253","date_posted":"2009-05-04 20:12:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a nice guy. Hard to understand at  because of his accent. In the first two weeks he checks attendance. I dont recommend skipping class because he gives out hw sheets randomly which get graded. He doesnt teach with the book. He doesnt check hw from the book either.

He doesn't use the book much but does a lot of examples in class. Tests are a little difficult but he dropped one and let us make up are next lowest grade for a better one.
