She does allow to revise but that is b/c she failed everyone on the assignment. She rambles on during 3 hr classes. Camera must be on. Doesn't teach how to teach students grades 3-5. I have learned nothing.

During lecture she doesn't even go over the assignments with us and teaches us like we are the elementary students. I feel as if I have gained no new knowledge and feel very stuck.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mjk4OTYw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE","date_posted":"2024-04-23 01:21:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"RUN. Don't let her smiles fool you. She is a extreme picky and tough grader and will not hesitate to give you the F on every paper. You'll  end up sacrificing your so much of your time revising your papers on the rubric she doesn't even follow. Rubric is so unclear. Boring and useless lectures too!!

She makes you keep the camera on for all 3 hours and never let's you leave early. Makes you go into break out rooms and expects everyone to talk all throughout the class which is really hard to do in an online class. She is a really tough grader and will fail you.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTkyMTc2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE","date_posted":"2024-02-22 01:19:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"She seems like a sweet person but her lectures are completely useless. She spends 90% of her time babbling information that isn't truly necessary to the current unit. She also provides so much busy work but not many students learn from it. She is also extremely picky on grading but her rubric isn't clear. Her 5 question quizzes is annoying also.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTkyMTM0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
