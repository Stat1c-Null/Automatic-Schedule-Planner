She goes super slow. I never had statistics before this and she makes it easy. I love her. Shes a little goofy but she tries to make every thing straight forward.

She goes over exactly what will be on the tests before you take it, she doesn't take attendance (although I encourage it to take notes) and you do not need any book at all! Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjU1NjEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2005-08-09 16:42:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"3 tests (drop the lowest) plus final... easy A if you go to class and pay attention to the lectures... no need to do homework unless it doesn't come to you immediately... the groupwork is difficult but do-able!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEwMTA2MzUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2005-04-20 14:38:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"She made Stats a pretty painfree experience.

The groupwork is always hard, but the homework relates to the chapter. There's four tests and you can drop the lowest grade. Always lets out early or on time. Don't ask questions or she'll snap at you.
