I have always struggled with math but he made the course really simple and easy to understand. Attendance is not mandatory, but at the end of the semester he will give up to 100 extra credit points if you showed up to class, so its worth it to go. I would recommend him to anyone, great teacher!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODQyODk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2022-11-17 18:53:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall he's a good person but the way he teaches is a no. He only goes through math problems that are in the book and projects his work but doesn't really explain how he got there. If you're looking for a class where you have to teach yourself this is the one. Almost all the chapters I had to learn myself.

Will try to get people to participate. Often problems can be solved different ways. Most kids dont come to class and use Alex to teach themselves. Thats not the instructors fault.

He wasn't the greatest teacher, he just went over the homework and did it on the board. I really taught myself everything because ALEKS shows you how to do it. Doing the homework and study guide will help a lot.

I only went to class for attendance for my grade, he doesn't really teach just does one example problem. Also will never respond to emails. If you are the kind of student who can teach each self and still pass feel free to take him, if you need a more hands-on professor do not take him!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzUwMjU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2021-12-24 18:31:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very caring. He would do problems on the board until everyone understood. Many people did not go to class and did not do the weekly homework. Tests were easy. Do the study guide, it really helps. He made us take the test in person so he could give us some credit even if we got the answer wrong.

Ended up having to withdraw from the class because I was not going to pass. He brings up the review in ALEKS and just solves the problem. Barely helps you understand what he is doing.
