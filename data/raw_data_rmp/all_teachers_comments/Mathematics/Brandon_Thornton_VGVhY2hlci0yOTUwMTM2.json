Used group work to allow us to teach ourselves instead of teaching. Other classes were allowed a notecard on each test, while he never mentioned them. He graded very late and regularly messed up easy algebraic problems.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODU3Nzcz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1111","date_posted":"2023-12-20 06:29:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a great professor, he tells you to study and do the homework to prepare for the quiz.

He didn't go into a deep explanation of the topics and vaguely answered questions. All hw was on Aleks and there were 3 exams and a final. His teachings were confusing. He didn't give extra credit or allow us to have a notecard for our exams, though other professors allowed it. If you study the class will be easy though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjU5MzE1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1111","date_posted":"2023-12-13 20:50:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Thornton is a helpful and kind teacher. Grades from the ALEKS modules/reports, 3 tests, and a final which replaces your lowest test. If you miss modules, you can do them for up to 75% credit near the end. Open to questions in and out of class. Test grades are fair w/ partial credit. Just do ALEKS and study - he will not make math overly hard.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjU0NzE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1111","date_posted":"2023-11-16 18:57:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"He good professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDA2MzQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
