I recommend taking this class, however be warned that he will regularly change or cancel homework after it's been assigned. He has trouble with MyMathLab. He's a great storyteller whose tests and quizzes are very easy if you've done well on the homework. He will sometimes allow \"cheat sheets\" which are great!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODgyNTMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2012-11-18 18:10:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor. Really funny. A little disorganized but very flexible and very willing to work with his students in any way possible and if you interact with him you should make a pretty easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODU4NDc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2012-11-16 09:26:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr.Noel was a fantastic teacher. He was very open minded to the students and always offered extra help or would go back over things to make sure they were clear. He also made things fun and is extremely interesting as well.

His syllabus has no due dates on it, and he determines test dates as he goes along. Homework is overwhelming at times just from the sheer volume of problems on MyMathLab.
