Other than that, he's a great teacher who explains the concepts of calculus well and is willing to answer whatever questions people may have. Assigns participation quizzes so that you can ask about certain questions, overall great teacher.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzE2NDc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3312","date_posted":"2014-12-21 01:04:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Linear Algebra is an interesting class. All you need to do for an A in this class is do the suggested HW, his quiz and exams are exactly the same. The exams would be so much fun if you do the hw. Good luck and have fun!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTU5MTY4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
