Class attendance is 5% so I never really went. Do all the extra credit and you will for sure make an A. All homework was on MyMathLab.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjI5MTAz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2012-12-11 12:13:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tom was a great teacher, always kept class interesting. He did a great job of showing how the math applied to real life situations while getting the point across. He is very witty and makes some pretty funny jokes. Homework is on my math lab, just keep up with it and you will be fine. His test are the same as the study guide. Overall great teacher!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDE5MjQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2012-11-12 20:50:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Listen, Tom is so cool. He is very intelligent and knowledgeable. His style of math is \"theory based\" he only believes in teaching/doing things that are meaningful and helpful so you won't see craziness on tests. And he's super funny.

The questions themselves are pretty easy but the way he words them are confusing. The lessons and homework are pretty easy. it's just a lot of homework. Sometimes I feel like he should teach a philosophy class instead of math.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE3NDIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
