Ask a question, and she'll answer; no disrespect. Pretty funny at times too! I do remember having to use myMathLab, so keep that in mind (all it was used for was homework).

The final replaces your lowest test grade, and the final was quite easy. She can't teach to save her life. If you need to be taught math, take anyone else. Class lasts all of 30 minutes, if you choose to go at all. Not accessible outside of class and no set office hours.

However, she flies through her lectures in usually about 30 minutes and when I get home and try to do my homework I often rely on mymathlab to teach the lesson for me instead.

Only teaches at night since she teaches highs school as well which sucks but her classes always get out early anyways. She is such a good teacher and always has an answer to your questions.

The lectures are straightforward and easy to follow. Class will always end early. The homework is on my math lab which is easy.
