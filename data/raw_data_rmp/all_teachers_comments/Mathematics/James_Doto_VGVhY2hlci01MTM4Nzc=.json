He was a good professor and I am not a math person.  Tests were open notes and open book which was a definite plus.

He is very laid back. Very nice. I think he's lenient when it comes to doing final grades because I thought I was going to fail but ended up with a B. You have many chances to up your grade because he'll replace test grades. Ex: Test 1-60%, Test 2-90%, he'll replace Test 1 with a 90% also. That's what he did with our class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NDMyNzMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2008-02-12 10:52:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Like what most people say, he's a very funny young teacher.
