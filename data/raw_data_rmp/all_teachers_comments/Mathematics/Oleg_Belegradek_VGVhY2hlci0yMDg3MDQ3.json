Gives a quiz everyday in class, but its for a small percentage. Homework after every lecture that is due online. Do the homework, and study the practice tests hard and you'll pass the class easily. Responds to emails quickly.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTM3MTI2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--SO MANY PAPERS--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2017-07-18 00:30:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He goes mostly by the book and gives examples from the book. If you memorize how the practice questions work in the same order you will be OK. DO THE HOMEWORK on Webassign its 10% of your grade. A Quiz every day but he usually does an example right before the quiz.  If you ask a question  the class answers.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTM4Mzk4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2017-02-23 10:31:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Even though he seems like he knows the material and seems to be teaching us, his teaching is not similar to everyone else. he doesn't wait to make sure everyone got the material he just continues to move.

The homework he gives is over webassign so you can buy the book with webassign but it's not mandatory. The hw is where you learn most the material. He walks into class with pieces of paper that he reads off  and copies it to the board; people ask him questions but he hardly answers them.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODQ0OTEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2016-12-19 12:32:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Heavy accent and boring, albeit by-the-book, explanations. The only reason to show up in class is to do the mandatory quizzes he hands out at the end of each lecture. Otherwise, you could easily follow the textbook according to the syllabus and still get at least a passing grade. At least he knows what he is teaching though.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTY1MTI1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Clear grading criteria--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
