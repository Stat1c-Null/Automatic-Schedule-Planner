ALEKS program heavy, homework is on ALEKS. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you want to pass, you should attend. Tough grader.

Dr. Kirwan is a good lecturer and knows his content well. He takes math down to the minute level to teach conceptually but then adds valuable teaching tips.

All of your grades come from EQ's, either in class alone or with your group, take home quizzes, and the final. Everything grade wise is structured the same, a 1-5 grading scale. Always has a practice explanation for homework after each class that is due at the next class.
