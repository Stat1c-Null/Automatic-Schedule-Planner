She tries to explain things in a way that might make sense to another math professor, but to a student who is looking at the material with fresh eyes, this class/teacher can be a bit frustrating","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTgxNjgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2010-01-08 12:38:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a very bad teacher,very unclear. to pass the class studying is a must, get help, study for test and quiz, very little homework..I got a B, ITS POSSIBLE TO GET AN A","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Njk2MTgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2009-10-25 20:23:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Has no idea how to teach.
