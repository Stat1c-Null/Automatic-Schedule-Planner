Some classmates and I worked on all tests together with the same exact work and answers yet some how received different grades. You get to exempt the final if you have an A but if you have anything lower he says your grade is \"a gambling game\" when it comes to the final.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzA2Nzgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1160","date_posted":"2016-11-29 22:46:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Baidoo was an amazing Calculus teacher! I was very nervous to take calc from what i had heard about other teachers, but he was great! Fall 2016 was his first semester and I personally feel like he did awesome! MUST GO TO CLASS TO GRASP CALC CONCEPTS!! There is homework every week, but just 2-3 due on Sunday night. Not a hard class if you try.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjgwNDgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Calculus is something that takes time. He goes very fast at his own pace and it is hard to keep up and you can not understand the material and get confused real fast. He does listen to class' opinions though!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTQ1MjIy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
