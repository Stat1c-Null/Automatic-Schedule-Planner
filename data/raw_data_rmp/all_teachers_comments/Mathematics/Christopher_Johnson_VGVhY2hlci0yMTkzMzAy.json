Never learned anything from class; started not going half way through the semester. Do your online homework &amp; read the textbook. That is the only way you'll pass the class. Some online quizzes which are easy and tests are not terrible but not easy either. Would not recommend him; far easier stats classes at KSU.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Nzc3ODMy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2018-03-24 22:44:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"boring guy with a very monotone voice but he is super easy. lets you have a cheat sheet on all test. you get 2 attempt on online quizzes, there is homework online weekly but its helpful, I use the homework to teach myself since I don't pay attn. in class and I make B's and A's on everything but I did take stat in highschool. he's willing to help","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjkyMzI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2016-11-16 18:12:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor, especially if you have struggled with statistics in the past.  Straight forward, taught from power points and the book.  He is helpful if you are having trouble and will work with you to make sure you succeed in his class.  I also find it a plus that he works in his field at the CDC and is so nice to his students.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjA0MTEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
