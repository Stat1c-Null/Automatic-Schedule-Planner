It doesn't seem fair for instructors to make attendance mandatory if some of the students can't even keep up with them. Students who can't keep up can just get tutoring if they don't get the lectures, yes?

This takes up most of class and we really don't get enough examples shown to do well on the test.  She occasionally takes up a few HW problems, but it is generally your option to do them.
