Yeah, a 101. She offered 100 bonus points and was decently clear with work and expectations. I would take her again if I had to retake this class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4ODgzMTM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2011-05-04 09:59:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Sweet lady! doesnt take attendance, but go to class! Homework assignments are in vista she gives you a week or more to do them. DO HOMEWORK!Three projects with groups, not hard. She is very understanding. Also, her study guides are exactly like the testa with different numbers! Easy math class if you come to class and take notes and pay attention.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTIyNzgw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
