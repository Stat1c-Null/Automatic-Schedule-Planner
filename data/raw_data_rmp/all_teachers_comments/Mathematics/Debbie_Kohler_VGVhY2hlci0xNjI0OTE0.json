Everyone from my HS knows to not take one of the kohlers. That being said, if you're not great at math don't take either of them. Seriously, they won't help you and you'll be better off asking another math professor or friend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTgyMjU2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2011-10-25 22:47:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's probably the worst possible teacher you can get if you're average at math.

She puts things on the tests that you've never seen before and aren't in the book. Everyone in my class has filed complaints against her to the dean. I'm an honors student with a 3.7 GPA, and I had to drop this class. She is THE worst teacher.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MDczNjEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
