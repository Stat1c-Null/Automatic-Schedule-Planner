Final didn't have a curve, but all tests did? Doesn't make sense. She said if ur final test grade was higher than any of the tests, she'd drop it, but how are you do u score higher on the final If the exams are a curved by a lot&the final isnt?

The quizzes and homework's are online which is great, but her powerpoints are not helpful. I'd recommend buying the book because although it is expensive, her ppts will not do much good to you.

She goes above and beyond to help her students succeed. Many people mistake her sarcasm for being rude.

She presents the material very well, it's all on power points that she posts online! Which is great so you can refer back to them when doing homework!
