Had her online for biostat, always responds to emails, extremely representative slides. Do all your work and you should be fine. Study the homeworks and quizzes. Ended up getting an A.

Her website was very poorly organized and extremely confusing. There was NO lecture at all in the class. Not even videos of her working a problem or example. She was zero use in the class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTM3NDU4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2012-06-07 20:41:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Goes out of her way to be helpful even with difficult material.
