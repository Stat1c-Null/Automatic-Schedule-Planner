Relates many topics to CS concepts which makes the class feel more useful. lots of hw but it is worth 40% so it's a fair trade. Cares about students and explains topics well.

A lot of work in the class is computational grunt work, so be warned. Some of the content in the first half of the semester felt trivial and slow, but that is really the class not him.
