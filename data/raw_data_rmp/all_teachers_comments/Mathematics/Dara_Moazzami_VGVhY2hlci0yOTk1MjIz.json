Gave plenty of extra credit and definitely seemed motivated to get students to pass. I took him over the summer so he sped past a lot of the material but was still nice enough to not make us cram literally everything for tests. I don't even like math classes.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDM0NDg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2345","date_posted":"2025-01-28 01:57:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"worst professor i have taken my whole college career. lied about giving me extra credit points, pretty much useless lectures (had to teach myself basically everything with yt videos), and just overall not a helpful teacher at all. there are many better options i would definitely stay away from this guy if you can.

I went to office hours, all the professor said was he already explained it in class. The professor teaches a weird syllabus, and uses copy pastes from the textbook, claiming he solved the problem.

The course is hard enough as it is without a professor who won't teach.
