She said all the exams and quizzes are from examples previous class and it is not hard....who believes? Unless, learned or know well about materials in Cal 2 NEVER EVER take this odd person's lecture.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTQyNTQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CALC1190","date_posted":"2013-04-10 19:05:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a great teacher who knows her stuff, and makes a concerted effort to try and get you to see applications that will help you understand the material better. One MAJOR drawback is that her tests are brutal hard IMO. She does draw some from the text book so study that an you should be ok.
