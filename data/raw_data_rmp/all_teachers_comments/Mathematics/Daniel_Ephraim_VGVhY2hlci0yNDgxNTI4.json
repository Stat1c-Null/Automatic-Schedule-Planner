Relies heavily on the textbook and just writes exactly what is on the book, on the board w/o explaining why he is writing it. He makes mistakes often so there's times where I have to completely scribble out the notes I wrote because it was wrong. Although, he did allow for extensions on hw if asked.

As such, when writing on board, he doesn't say wut hes writing so is hrd 2 follow. Zero review. No such thing as partialcredit. Suggest you avoid unlss you have strong calculus understanding.
