Even if the whole class agrees we are confused, he will not re-explain and tells us that we can learn it ourselves. He speaks bluntly and is mildly rude. Didnt drop his class so I wasnt here another semester, but I 100% would have. HW and quizzes are easy, still not worth it","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMzg5MDkx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"STATS1000","date_posted":"2018-04-26 01:26:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you want an easy A &amp; not have to learn anything take him. 1 group project that lasts the entire semester &amp; he helps you with it. All quizzes, hw, &amp; tests are online so you can use your notes. He even lets you use notes on the final. My class was only on Mondays 8-1045 pm but it generally only lasted until 9 or @ way latest 930.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODk4OTQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2018-04-24 09:34:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Most of the class was through ConnectMath, if you sit in the back of the class you probably will not hear a thing he says. His lectures are iffy, I never really payed attention to them. You can teach yourself the course using ConnectMath examples and guides.

Lectures are pretty boring, but he only does it for about an hour or so. He gives you the rest of the time to ask questions and work on your group projects. Everything is online; homework, quizzes, and tests.

Good man, but bad teacher, you'll pretty much have to do all self-study. All homework, tests, and quizzes are online. Unlimited attempts on HW, 2 tries per quiz.  Pro-calculator use. Big mandatory group project due at the end of the semester.
