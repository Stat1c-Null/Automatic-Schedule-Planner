Very open to questions, gave very clear explanations with real-life scenarios.

My best advice is to GO TO CLASS and DO YOUR HOMEWORK... you have to work at it, but she'll get you through it!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMDkzMDQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
