The site was down at least once a week and Vi was very understanding of this and opened quizzes and homework that were affected. She opens all quizzes and homework at the end of the semester that you may have missed and offers up to an entire letter grade worth of Extra credit throughout the course.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODUwNjc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2332","date_posted":"2016-03-28 13:03:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Vi. is a fantastic professor. She does tend to call students out, but it's very entertaining. She doesn't allow cellphones in class, so forget about it ! She teaches by powerpoint and uploads the powerpoints before the exams. The homework and quizzes are all online, you must purchase an access code. She teaches assuming your using a ti84 calculator","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTkxNDky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
