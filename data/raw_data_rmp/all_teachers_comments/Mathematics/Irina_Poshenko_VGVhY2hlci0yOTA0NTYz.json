She is very nice and considerate, and you can tell that she wants you to succeed in the class. The work can be very long, but she is always giving our class extensions on any of the homework assignments. If there is any teacher, I recommend for college algebra, it's her!

She is very rude and trys to compare us to previous classes when we don't understand something. She has a very strong Russian accent. The tests count heavy and the assignments in Aleks DO NOT help your grade move much.

Not to mention she's quiet and you can barely understand her. She's understanding when it comes to grades and late work which is nice but she assigns a lot of homework in Aleks and has lots of random quizzes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NzkyMzQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Beware of pop quizzes--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2024-08-08 15:55:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Poshenko is one of the fairest professors I've ever had. The class is done through ALEKS, and as long as you do the work, you'll get a decent grade. She will sometimes extend out deadlines if she notices that people are getting behind, and she allows a small notecard cheat sheet for her tests.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjcwNTEy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Lots of homework","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
