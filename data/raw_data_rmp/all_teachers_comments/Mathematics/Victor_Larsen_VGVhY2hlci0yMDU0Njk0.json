I wasn't upset at all because he challenged me and I felt great about the work I did. He's not the type of professor that's unreasonably hard so he can challenge you. Victor takes time to give you problems to make you think about the overall picture. Victor is an Amazing Professor!

Weekly homework - doable if you understand the lectures. He's a very nice white guy who brings cookies for tests. Four tests, none cumulative. He will challenge you in a good way, just come to class and ask questions if you don't understand. He loves the subject and is happy to help!

Put most of your time into the homework assignments from the start, they are very effective. Go to office hours more than a day before homework is due.

He has office hours which is a must for this class, because he will help you immensely. Make sure you do homework because if you do, it makes the tests a lot easier.
