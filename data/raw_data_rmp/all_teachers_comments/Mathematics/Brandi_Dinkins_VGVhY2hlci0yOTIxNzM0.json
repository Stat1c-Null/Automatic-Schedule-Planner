While she did move along concepts fairly quickly, she is a great professor who explains concepts clearly and in a way that is easy to understand and follow. She also posted the lecture ppt after every every class, so if you happened to miss class, you wouldn't fall behind.

She explained concepts well, and was great at answering peoples questions. She had office hours, and worked in the math open lab and was always willing to help. She was always so nice and even did an interview with me for a scholarship I applied to. I wish she taught my other math classes!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTExMjIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2025-01-08 16:57:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is AMAZING! This course requires attendance, or you'll fail. I had surgery and missed 3 months but passed by studying on ALEKS and attending SI sessions when I returned. The ALEKS homework has many questions weekly, but you get 3 extra days for an 80. The SI tutor helped a lot, and I still got an A. It's doable, but don't slack off!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTA4NDY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2025-01-07 02:25:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly, the class materials in themselves were not that difficult or confusing but it was so difficult to pay attention in class. I mean she was nice and all,  but I never really got the impression that she cared about her students grades. Also, attendance is graded and all tests are in-person and on paper which kinda sucks.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDk2NzQw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Math1113","date_posted":"2024-12-02 02:50:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"I honestly really liked her, she was always really sweet, and explained the lectures really well.

Had homework weekly on aleks but easy to complete. 4 major tests plus the final, allowed to use notecards on tests. Very straightforward and uses aleks practice tests for the test questions.

She is not accommodating and tests are not like what we do in class.
