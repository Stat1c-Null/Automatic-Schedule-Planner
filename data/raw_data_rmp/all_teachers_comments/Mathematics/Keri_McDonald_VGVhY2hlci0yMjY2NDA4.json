I took it as a hybrid so attendance was &quot;mandatory&quot; but you could sign yourself in at the beginning and leave and she won't notice but her class is entertaining. Most days she'll just go over stuff but sometimes there are presentations. Assignments are on Bearface and are pretty easy. She's also really nice.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjU1NzEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2018-03-29 16:00:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is awesome and nice. This class is the easiest class I have ever taken. She makes class interesting and you actually learn unlike other classes were its memorization. All assignments, midterm, and test are online. I took the hybrid you can only miss 2 classes and thats about all you need to know.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NzE1Njc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?

You can also only miss two days of class . Other than that, she is a fun professor and she is easy to get along with. I would definitely take her again she is fun tests are easy and online.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTc0NDg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

She genuinely cares about if you know the material, and she works really hard to make the class fun with participation and activities. I took her hybrid so most of the work was online, and she doesn't require proof. She's super understanding and willing to work with you if medical or family emergencies come up.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTEwMzMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2017-12-07 12:17:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take her hybrid! She uses Bearface, and the majority of your grade comes from SIMPLE assignments. You DON'T have to exercise!! (She doesn't require proof, unlike other professors). Midterm, final, and homework on Bearface. Midterm and final are difficult, but open-note and online. Take notes and keep up with homework, and it's an easy A!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDc5NjYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Hilarious--Tests are tough","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2017-11-28 18:58:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's extremely nice and tries to make class fun. Unlike other wellness teachers, I took the hybrid, so we did not ever have to sign in hours in the rec center. All you had to do was show up to class and participate in activities, which were fun, and listen to lectures and guest speakers. Keep up with your modules and you will be fine. Easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTgxMTIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
