I also asked a lot of questions and I see a tutor. Just because a prof doesn't break down everything in baby steps doesn't mean she's a bad professor. Apply yourself and she will appreciate it and take notice.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDEwOTQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2011-11-15 16:18:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's really quiet and somewhat unapproachable.  There are 4 tests and a final and your lowest test grade gets dropped.  Every single one of her notes is straight out of the textbook along with her test questions.  The class is relatively easy as long as you do the homework she assigns.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjQ0MjA4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2011-11-03 18:14:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"I hate math. That being said, this teacher, although quiet and seemingly unapproachable is shes an ok teacher. there are only 4 tests and one final. your lowest test gets dropped. BUT the test questions are straight off your homework, so if you do your homework its easy to get an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTU3NDgw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2011-10-24 18:02:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is difficult and unapproachable. She refuses to answer any questions until after class and 'teaches' like you should already know what she's talking about. There is no help and without the book and high tests grades, you're out of luck. You can barely hear her and she makes mistakes. She really hates it when she is corrected.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTAyMDI0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2011-09-20 23:00:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Terrible teacher.  She does not help and can't even answer questions.  The only grades are four test grades so if you don't do well on those..you fail.
