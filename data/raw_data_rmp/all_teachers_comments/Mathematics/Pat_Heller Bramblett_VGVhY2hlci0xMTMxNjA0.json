She has been a life saver for someone who hasn't worked a formula or equation in a really long time.  Don't be afraid to ask questions, that's what she's there for.  Like most things, you get out of her class what your willing to put in to it.

If I missed a class, it was easy to catch up but I still hated missing because she's just so great. She really cares about what her students do.
