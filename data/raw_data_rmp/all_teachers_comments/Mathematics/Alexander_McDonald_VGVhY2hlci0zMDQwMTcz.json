Rushes material w/o any interruptions. Ask a question, you'd get a condescending response. Curves exams ~40pts as the class avg. was disastrously low (~15-19%). Harsh grader.

His grading is harsh, you either get full credit or none, only rarely do you get partial credit. His feedback is not helpful whatsoever.

Professor made no effort to apply different teaching methods after the majority the of class made it clear that his teaching method was not effective. Most of the class barely passed his exams.

He gives no study guides (he just says \"study everything\") for his exams and does not let you make them up for any reason either. There are only two exams and a final (60% of grade). There is homework which will probably be my saving grace for this class (40%).
