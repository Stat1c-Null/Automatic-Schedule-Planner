She teaches middle school math so a lot of her teaching is easy to understand and graspable. Homework is distributed fairly, tests are put into the grade book quickly, and she makes sure everyone understands a concept before she moves on. Definitely recommend her!!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjY1ODEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2011-12-14 12:31:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"LOVE LOVE LOVE her! The people who are giving her a bad rating probably never came to class and failed because Mrs. Stanton is the most helpful and understanding professor I have every had. Do decent on the homework and quizes and go to the study groups and you'll be FINE.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTAzNDc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH20","date_posted":"2010-11-05 12:12:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Stanton has been one of the most helpful teachers I've come across this semester. She comes to class early to help studets with homework and answer any questions they may have. She does take attendance so be sure to be there EVERYDAY. And just remember this is math, if you miss a day you are way behind. Overall she is a wonderful teacher!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzMyMTI2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2010-05-21 20:53:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Stanton is not helpful or undertsanding. She does not explain the material well. Math is usually my best subject, but I found this class to be very difficult. I had to find another teacher to help me with the material. It seemed like there was a high level of confusion with most of the student most of the time. I would not recommend her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjUwMzA4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2010-05-18 20:12:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"stay away if you want an A. Mrs. Stanton is very nice but makes this class much more difficult than it should be. take Lucas instead. Complpicated grading system and teacher makes no exceptions for borderline students no matter how hard you work. she is also very strict on attendance for college.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjI5MTM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
