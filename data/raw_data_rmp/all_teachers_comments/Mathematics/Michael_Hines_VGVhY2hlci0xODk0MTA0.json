I have done all the homework and he gave me 0's for half of them!I got an 88 on the first test and he puts in a 70. If you don't understand his lectures then you basically have to teach yourself. Makes statistics more difficult than it needs to be!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTgwNzMw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2014-05-06 19:57:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Hines is not a good teacher at all. He uses powerpoints, but skips over most of the material and doesn't explain it to you. He doesn't respond to email until days later. He is very unorganized. I am very good at math, but I barely am passing the class with a B. I had to use the book and the internet to teach myself math. Do not take him.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTgwNDc1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2014-05-05 18:01:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly of the worst teachers I have ever had. Sooooo disorganized, so unclear, never gives grades back. Doesn't respond to emails, and if he does it's not for DAYS. Doesn't ever tell you what actual grade is in the class. If you want to teach yourself the course then take this class, but if you want to actually be taught avoid at all costs!!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTY5Mjkw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107","date_posted":"2014-05-02 12:41:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hines is probably the most unorganized professor I've had so far. Lectures aren't clear and sometimes pointless. You definitely need the text book to teach yourself and if you're not good at teaching yourself, don't take this class! If you're struggling toward the end of the semester, he gives some extra credit. Can exempt final with an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTQ5MzM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2014-04-25 13:21:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"He never shows up for meetings, and he is one of the most confusing professors I have ever taken.
