I usually hate and struggle with math (of any kind), professor barbier helped me understand a lot. He breaks concepts down very clearly in his lectures, and if you still don't understand,   he breaks it down further. 4 exams, cumulative final, light homework. TAKE HIM.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTM2NDI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2012-12-02 15:50:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"super helpful....take this professor....he rocks!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTMwOTgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1106","date_posted":"2012-11-20 14:45:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tried taking Stats a few semesters ago and I was SO lost after the first test.

I can't say enough good things about him. Not only is he attractive (which is beside the main point) but he is very humble!
