He was very helpful and explained new topics thoroughly and clearly. I'm not sure what others are mentioning about him just using the book, cause in my class he expressed deep distaste for the book. And no, he doesn't grade homework. This is established very early on.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDI3NDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2345","date_posted":"2012-12-21 18:28:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had Dr. Xu for 3 classes this semester, Stats, Discrete, and Calc2. I made A's in all 3. Dr. Xu teaches with a great mix of knowledge and humor. Also grades some of his test with a curve. It depends on how well the rest of the class is doing. He also allows you to use a formula sheet on test and quizes. He is always willing to help outside of class","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTQ4NzM2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2306","date_posted":"2012-06-07 14:16:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Xua is awesome!  Very energetic, extremely knowledgeable, and actually made Differential Equations quite enjoyable.  He is very challenging and the final was extremely difficult.  Grades on a curve and is very fair in his grading.

He is always energetic in teaching somestimes he goes over the class time though. I only passed 2 test out of 4 still made a C. Make sure you practice the practice test because they are VERY similiar to the tests.

Very knowledgeable succinct. He does go pretty fast, but I didn't find it tough to keep up with him. He's very good at skipping unnecessary stuff and teaching just what you need to know. Class has 4 tests, with lowest dropped. Each test has a sample test that he reviews before and will sometimes use problems from it for the test.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzY3MDEw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2254","date_posted":"2011-11-30 09:22:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy to understand if you're capable of understanding accents.

He is good at answering good questions, but if you ask a stupid question or you're way off, he may not get a grasp on where you are. He goes fast so you're gonna have to pay close attention. If you put forth the effort while in lecture you'll be fine. Also don't worry, his english is great.
