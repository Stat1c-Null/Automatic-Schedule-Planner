She makes it difficult to make up assignments if you go out of town for work. I taught myself from Aleks. You do not get graded for attendance, students who went to her class compared to those who didn't, got worse grades.

Loved her! HW on ALEKS, very knowledgable about math, takes attendance, thick accent (sit close), strong policy against phones, lets you have front &amp; back paper cheat sheet for every test, gives practice tests (EXACT format of real tests). Recommend if you are good at math already.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1Mjc3MTE2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2021-11-14 16:34:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst Prof. ever had. Shes very rude and sarcastic. She reads off the PowerPoint and sometimes says search it up on your own time bc idk how to do it. Theres some people who take paper tests, and she went crazy on them. I thought about dropping the class since she isnt helpful what do ever. Aleks and a tutor is teaching me.
