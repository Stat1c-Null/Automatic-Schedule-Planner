I think he was an easy A because you do not have any homework that he checks, you get half a letter grade of extra credit for showing up everyday, his test/quiz questions are identical to what he goes over in class, aaaand he drops 3/8 lowest quiz grades. I am only averagely smart and I got a final grade of 99.54. ;)","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDIwOTI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Not always eager to answer questions but he keeps his class as interesting as math can possibly be and is actually a good teacher. Speak loudly when talking to him and put in some effort you should pass this class.

First, his quizzes and tests are pretty much directly from the book so if you do the ungraded hw you will get an A almost assuredly.  Second, he allows you to bring formula sheets to quizzes and tests.  Finally, he gives extra credit for attendance and you can use any calculator.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDk4MDQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Hilarious--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2232","date_posted":"2016-09-02 13:07:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher will fail you if you miss even the smallest of instructions.

Several students did not circle a test version (the versions are not printed clearly on the front page, they are on the back of a random page in the tests) and he automatically slams them with a 0 even if they would have made an A otherwise.
