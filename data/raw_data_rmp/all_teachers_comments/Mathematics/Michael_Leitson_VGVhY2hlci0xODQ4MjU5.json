Leitson is extremely difficult to understand, he makes tons of mistakes, and he's extremely boring. Not to mention, I could hardly understand his voice. That said, he's super sweet and nice.   If you're good at math, take him. If not....","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTA0OTg1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2015-12-14 14:52:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am terrible at math, but came out with a strong A. Professor is very knowledgeable and will do whatever it takes so that you can understand the information. If you are not patient, he probably isn't  for you. He can be tough to understand at times, but he is a very nice man and will do everything it takes for you to understand it.

His teaching style is stand at the board and do the problem and just say what he's doing. He doesn't explain much unless you raise your hand and ask for explanation. This works well for me, but I know it doesn't for everyone. However, I made my first A in a math class thanks to him!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzA4NzQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2013-12-10 21:07:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"When I signed up for this class, I thought I'd hate it for sure. Professor Mike made the class enjoyable, he's down to earth, friendly, and genuinely wants you to succeed.
