I got an A because of the sheer ungodly amount of work I did between tests. Wording test questions in such an unfamiliar format compared to her homework &amp; lessons was just an awful way to give exams.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTc1MDEx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Accessible outside class--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2010-10-20 01:19:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very difficult class, but very clear notes given daily.  MUST attened class.  She is always very helpful.  If you do all homework and some extras in your book you will be ok.  This is not a cake walk class, you will either learn something or fail. Be aware she will not be walked all over or abused, and your grade reflects your effort.

She is willing to go out of her way to meet with students for extra help, and she emails back with very clear, detailed answers.  However the tests were very difficult for me and most of the rest of the class.

I am typically a A/B student but that will not be the case anymore after this case. I agree with the others here. Her tests have nothing to do with her reviews at all!

I can not wait for this semester to be over. She is by far the worst math teacher i have ever had. If you do not teach yourself from the homework lessons on MyMathLab you will fail. Period.
