Uses print-outs to teach and points at it to teach. Doesn't go through step by step. MyMathLab is how you learn the material. Don't take this class if you're bad at math (like me). Also likes to point out the same person to answer questions every class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTIwNTk1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1112","date_posted":"2015-11-11 23:56:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor probably should retire. He is a funny guy, but he doesn't bother using actual trig terms and loses track of what he is saying.   Commonly refers to equations as cute and magnificent.  Likes saying holy shoes! And happier than a pig in yogurt! Lessons are unclear and he isn't good with tech. Don't take his class!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mzk2NDEw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1112","date_posted":"2015-11-06 10:40:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"You really need to be good at math do keep up. He's fast but if you ask questions he does his best to help and will always do his best to make sure you get it. Doing the homework is the best way to learn the material. He's sarcastic and funny and a goofy old fart but is a really nice guy.

If you are not good at math already, do not take this class. I find myself leaving class more confused than I do on the homework. Copying notes is hard to do as he goes through the slides fast, which are straight out of the textbook. Also, he does take attendance and will call on people, so expect to answer questions.
