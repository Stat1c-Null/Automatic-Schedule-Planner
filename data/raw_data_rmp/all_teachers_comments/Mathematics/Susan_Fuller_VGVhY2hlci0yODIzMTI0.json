She will make sure you understand before moving on to the next topic. She grades based on work shown rather than just the correct  answer.

Lectures are engaging and very straightforward. She doesnt require attendance grade-wise, but still need to go to class. Its okay if you have to miss it, shes very understanding. Homework is a lot of ALKES every week, a website to do math online, but its easy to manage and self-explanatory. Quizzes every week but are super easy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODg4MzEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Amazing lectures --Lots of homework","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COLLEGEALGEBRA","date_posted":"2022-11-04 22:08:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Fuller is the best math teacher I've ever had. She does an excellent job in explaining concepts in class, and always offers additional help outside of class. If you put in any amount of effort, you will pass.

She also permits a index card for each test.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzgxODM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COLLEGEALGEBRA","date_posted":"2022-11-02 19:11:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Weekly pop quizzes, the test are sometimes easy and sometimes hard.

She is VERY lenient with late work/missing assignments & gives you a couple of freebies, but dont take advantage of that. ALEKS each week(so dont procrastinate), & gives partial credit for tests/pop quizzes. She really helps you grasp the material with her teaching style.
