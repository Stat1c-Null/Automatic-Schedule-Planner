I would not reccomend taking this class in the summer semester, like I did, as it is a lot of work in a short time. If you do decide to take his class and are struggling - visiting the academic success center made a huge difference from me. 8/10","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTYwMjM0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2010-07-17 01:35:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very helpful and easy to understand.

He is. Dont take him if you want a professor that going to answer your questions w/o making you feel small or if you want a professor that's actually happy to be teaching and not miserable.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTkyMDU4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2010-05-06 17:32:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I wouldn't recommend him, not that good of a teacher. Homework is online and pretty tough. The good thing about him is that he will give  bonus points and possibly up your grade in the class if he can tell your trying.

He doesn't teach the class and gets annoyed when you have questions in class. The homework is all done online and it never corresponds to what we are learning in class. He is extremely rude and calls you out in front of the entire class if you make a mistake or ask a question!

If you end up with him, here's how my class was: He's not mean. HW is all online. Textbook is helpful. You will need it to teach yourself all the material. Class isn't mandatory. You take 3 tests. Attend review day classes & you're good to go. You do a simple group project. Class usually ends 15 min early.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzQ2NTM2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2009-11-04 17:26:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"horrible teacher.  class isn't mandatory.  nobody seems to understand him.  homework is online and hard.  he struggles to do work he assigns us.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzE0NDY0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
