While she does give partial credit, she takes off for the TINIEST of \"errors\". You can get every question right on a test and she'll find a mistake somewhere  in the work.

However, her class is something you have to work for. She gives you tons of opportunities to get extra credit which helps a lot. She is a VERY picky grader.
