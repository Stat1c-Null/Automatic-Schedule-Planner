Extremely time-consuming class with homework taking 2-3 hours per assignment, and 3 assignments per week. Made this class harder than diff eq and linear.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTY4NTUy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2024-04-24 17:33:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Cueva is not a bad teacher but he's an impossible grader who works against you. You're not allowed to memorize anything for tests which becomes really taxing later in the course. He'll give some partial credit, but VERY little of it. You have 30-50 HW questions a week. He also frequently belittles students for questions.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjUyNzc0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2023-10-11 01:20:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO take this class if:\n\nYou are a math heavy major and need to MASTER Algebra\n\nYou can learn easily by yourself with minimal instruction\n\nYou know your multiplication table, perfect squares, square roots, forwards, backwards, left and right\n\nYou know how to ask questions using proper mathematic terms\n\nPS: Quiz every Friday.

The lack of review is annoying and his lectures don't translate well to the students. If you don't do it exactly to his liking, you miss the whole problem. NO PARTIAL CREDIT! Allows some retakes for points.

He is a tough grader, but makes up for it in extra credit opportunities. He also gives you the whole semester to improve quiz grades. Most homework assignments are long, but prepare you well for the tests/quizzes. And he always does recaps of what you should have learned in previous courses before he introduces new topics.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzgxNzEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2022-10-14 15:06:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Cueva is a very harsh grader on tests that hardly relate to the resources we have to study. He also does not care about his students almost as if he wants us to fail his class. He seems passionate about what he teaches, but this does not translate well to his students.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzAxMzcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
