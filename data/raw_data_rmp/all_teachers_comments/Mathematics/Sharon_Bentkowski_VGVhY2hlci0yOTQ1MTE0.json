It is very concept based rather than just equations to solve. She lets you have a note card for every test. You should expect to have a one to two question quiz every week, but they are easy, and you can use notes. The only problem I had was she ran the class like a High School class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODgzNzc2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2024-01-13 02:45:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"I think she means well, but is not a very good teacher. She races through lectures and doesn't like when you ask questions (is condescending). This class takes up almost all your available time as homework takes several hours to complete each week. The 3 tests + the final exam make up 68% of your grade. Hard to pass unless you are good at algebra.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODc1OTk4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1001","date_posted":"2024-01-11 21:17:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not choose this professor! She is a tough grader and her tests are so difficult. NO EXTRA CREDIT GIVEN BY HER. I did not like her attitude as well when you ask for help.

Her lectures were straight to the point, and she tried her best to make sure everyone was understanding the material as she went along. Grades consisted of 3 tests, the final, hw on ALEKS, and quizzes (she dropped lowest exam for final). As long as you go to class and study, an A is VERY attainable.

If you have questions, ask! I will say though, if it's about something gone over in class multiple times, she's unlikely to answer.

She is nice to talk too sometimes, but it all depends on how she feels. Study everything, even if she says you might not need to know it. Very time consuming course.
