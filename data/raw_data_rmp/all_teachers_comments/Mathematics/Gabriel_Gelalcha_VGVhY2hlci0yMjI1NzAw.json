You can come in early to class and he will help you understand the material, but not very good at explaining concepts. There is a ton of weekly homework- anywhere between 9 and 16 sections to complete. Most tests were like the study guide, but some were completely different.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDIyNzgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COLLEGEALGEBRA","date_posted":"2021-07-17 00:55:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would say he was ok. He took attendance and used it for a grade at the end of the semester. He has an accent so it can be hard to understand him at times and his handwriting is a little sloppy at times too. When holding lectures DONT be afraid to ask questions bc he may confused you at times.

All homework and tests were completed through Aleks, (an online math program). Personally, I found him hard to understand, and even harder given he wore a mask during lectures. I think there are bonus points for attendance but I'm not 100% sure.
