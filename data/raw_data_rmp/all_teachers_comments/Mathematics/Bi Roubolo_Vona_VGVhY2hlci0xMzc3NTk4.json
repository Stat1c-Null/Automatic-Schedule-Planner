I liked the teacher, not his teaching. Within weeks he started teaching us partial DiffEO even though partial diff is NOT an &quot;ordinary&quot; DiffEQ. Couldn't keep on schedule and ended up skipping large portions of the material (Ch5). He also has a thick African accent that doesn't help when teaching a hard math concept.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NzkwNjk2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2306","date_posted":"2011-05-07 15:24:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best Math Teacher ever.

I've taken him for Diff EQ and Pre-Calc, and I have to say.. he's interesting. He has a hard accent to get past at first, but his strange sense of humor makes up for it.

He doesn't try to trick you on the tests. Tests are very straight-forward and come from the homework. Attendance accounts for 10% of your grade and all you have to do is sign in and leave if you want to.
