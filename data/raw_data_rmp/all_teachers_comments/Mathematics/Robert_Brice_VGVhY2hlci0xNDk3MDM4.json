He made it not only understandable but interesting. He makes himself available to help you after class if you need it, the tests were really close to what you did in class/homework, & he is very approachable and easy to talk to. DEFINITELY take his class if you can. I wish he were teaching higher math classes too.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDA3NTEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2011-04-05 17:56:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Brice last semester for Precalculus. Precalculus isn't fun no matter how you slice it. But Brice was laid back and he managed to keep it from being too painful.

I really enjoyed the class esp since I mostly just had to come for tests but he made it fun so I came to class more often to the end of the year and I have an 91 in the class. btw use additional sources b/c the book is just ok.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Nzc4NDI4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
