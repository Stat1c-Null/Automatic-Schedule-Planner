Was very nervous on almost all tests and quizes, but the reviews and sheets prior were very helpfull, so keep them.  Math is never really pleasant, but with her, it was bareable. Make sure that you show up for class, or it's 'harder' to ask questions.  There's a plus if you don't miss very many classes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNjYzMTM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CALC","date_posted":"2006-06-13 12:19:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"No Comments","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExOTk5OTcz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2006-05-12 03:01:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wow...she was crazy.
