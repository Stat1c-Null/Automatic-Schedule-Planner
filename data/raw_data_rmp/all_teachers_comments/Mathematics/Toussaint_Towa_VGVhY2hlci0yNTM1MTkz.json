His lectures made our evening class want to rip out our hair, and it was very confusing since he did everything in a very particular, weird, unapproachable way. He wasn't available outside the class except after class because he prioritized his grad studies.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODEzMzM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Lecture heavy--So many papers","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2020-01-01 02:30:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Grade was based off of 4 homework's and 4 tests. The tests were only 5 questions, but lectured about so many different things. Final was the worst. he was hard to understand and was always late during test days.

He is a kind man and knows his math but he is not a good teacher. He overcomplicates things and combined with his accent it is easy to end up confused. The tests are hard and he speaks during them so you do not get the full class period.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzc1NTQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

If you took Algebra 2 in high school you would understand some of what he says, but the way he explains it makes it extremely harder then it actually is. Hard test. Lots of homework. Not mandatory to show up. Curves test are the only good thing about his class.
