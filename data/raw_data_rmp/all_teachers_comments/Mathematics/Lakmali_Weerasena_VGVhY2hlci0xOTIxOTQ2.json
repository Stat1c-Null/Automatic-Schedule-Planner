She makes you follow her incredibly confusing way or she'll fail you. She is constantly erasing what she just wrote because she got confused herself. I thought teachers had to be understandable to become college professors.

The thing is, she will help you if you ask for it.  Her accent is hard to understand at times but for the most part her quizzes and tests are very easy and straight forward.  You will not be able to use a calculator either.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDMyMTYy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2014-09-26 00:02:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Terrible. Might as well just go ahead and teach yourself because that's what I have to do now. She copies EVERYTHING from the book and doesn't explain any of it or go in depth at all. My fave quote from her: \"I don't know if you guys get it or not, but that's all I can do for you.\"","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjEzODQx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
