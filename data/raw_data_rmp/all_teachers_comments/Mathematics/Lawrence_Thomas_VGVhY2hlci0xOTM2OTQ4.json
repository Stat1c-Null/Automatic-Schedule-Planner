Witty, awkward, caring, but also necessarily tough. Calculus is difficult, but not if you work at it, and he gives PLENTY of tools to work at it. TONS of extra credit which WILL save your grade. Be prepared for pop quizzes and DO THE STUDY GUIDES: they match the test","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTQ1NzQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2017-05-17 14:01:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"i've never had to work so hard in a class before, I got my first C. He teaches the easy stuff so long that you don't get to learn the hardest part of the chapters from him. A few pop quizzes... bonus points are available from doing the HW early, and taking attendance quizzes. His class is doable, but its very tough, I also had to get a tutor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzMyNDkx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2017-03-23 19:08:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is the OB1 of Calculus II! If a person cannot learn Math 2202 from him, they need to go to Mathnasium and hire a tutor! If a student opens his mouth and ask for help from Professor Thomas, he WILL give you the skinny. He responds to any emails immediately. He also answers his phone during his office hours.

I'm telling the truth. If you study, you cannot miss A or B. You will get at least A or B if you study. He is so awesome. a lot of extra credits, not many homework. He also gives you a study guide about your test and final. I'm definitely sure if you study the study guide you will get A on test!! Take his class!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzM0ODQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2016-12-19 13:46:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is a tough one. He is pretty lenient on the grading of his tests (which are NOT multiple choice), and sometimes announces quizzes but other times doesn't. The final was pretty easy, to be honest. I barely got a B in the class with lots of studying involved. Take him if you are up for it, but it is definitely not an 'easy' pass.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTY2MTgw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2016-08-31 11:38:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He was really rude in class and made you feel stupid for asking questions. He hardly explained anything.

He gives you the tools to learn, but you will have to search for help. He is very generous with bonus work and it is crucial to getting an A. Homework can be tedious. When asking questions, get ready to rephrase the question until he answers. But he is nice. If he can tell you are trying, he is very helpful.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTY0OTUz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2016-05-12 10:35:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"It's calculus, so it's not easy, but he explains the material pretty clearly. He also goes through a lot of examples. You do need to go to class because he doesn't always tell you when the quizzes are and there's bonus attendance quizzes. The tests aren't easy, but not too hard either. You have to study to do well, but it's doable.

Professor Lawrence is weird. I learned everything from the MyMathLab HW. Kind of boring. The only redeeming quality is that his study guides are excatly like the exams, with a number change here and there. The Study guides have detailed paragraphs explaining the answer.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDM5NzMz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
