His lectures are interesting and keep you awake. He only gives about 10 HW problems a week. Your lowest test grade is only 10% of your grade then the next is 15 and then 20. His tests are very easy as long as you show up to class. He is very quick to reply to emails and wants to help you pass. Pick Faver.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTUzMzQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
