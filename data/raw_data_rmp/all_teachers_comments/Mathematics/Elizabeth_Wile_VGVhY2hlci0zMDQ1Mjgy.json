She is approachable (even during quizzes and tests) and truly wants her students to succeed. She gives as much possible credit on tests as she can with partial credit for answers. Definitely take her if you can!

She made everything easy to understand, and was very willing to help if you were struggling. A lot of quizzes and tests but you are allowed a note sheet for each. ALEKS homework but unlimited attempts and she gives a lot of time to do them.

She explained everything very well and provided enough online material to study for the tests. She was also very patient when answering students' questions.

Class is very important as you learn stuff every single day. If you show up and lock in for the amounted time, you will do good.There is a good bit of online homework too.
