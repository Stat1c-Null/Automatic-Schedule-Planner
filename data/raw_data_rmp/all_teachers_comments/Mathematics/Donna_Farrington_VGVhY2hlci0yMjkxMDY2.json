Very kind and inviting to ask questions. Attendance is not mandatory but her lectures are VERY necessary to pass. She is overall a great professor. She grades on a 20 point scale for each test which helps students not fail the tests/pass the course. 6 tests which she totals and divides by 6. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODE5NTU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Go to office hours if you have the opportunity to because it really makes a difference in your grade. Attendance is not mandatory, but I wouldn't miss class because you'll most likely will miss a lot.
