Even though attendance is mandatory, it's ok if you are running behind a few times. All hw is through Aleks, and quizzes are online through D2L and you're able to tab out and use notes if needed. There are 3 tests that are on paper, but you get to use a \"cheat sheet\" and then are able to do test corrections after.

He wasn't the best at teaching. I would say to take his class for an easy prof and assignments, and go to the smart lab and ask them to teach you (ask for Gabriel). Rather than go to his classes that's what I would do. Quizzes are online with a webcam but open notes. Tests in person with a note card. ALEKS hw.

Super chill guy, really passionate about getting his students to learn the info, he literally explains even the tiny details. ALEKS HW for every unit, takes an hr or 2.

Super chill, not a lot of workload. Tests are in person but quizzes and homework are online. He lectures very easily, and everything is easy to understand. Honestly, if you actually try and just do the work, there's no reason you shouldn't get an A in his class. 10/10 reccomend this guy.
