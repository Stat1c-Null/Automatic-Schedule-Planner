Had some family stuff come up and was more than willing to work around my issues. His assignments make sense and homework is not unreasonable. He has many resources is very communicative. Seriously take his class he is a blessing amongst the scourge that is ksu professors.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTE5Mzgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2017-08-17 15:19:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"It took me three tries to pass Precalc, and I only did it because of Professor Davenport. He uses MyMathLab extensively, but he's always ready to answer questions outside of class through texts or email. He also has extra consideration for students who use the optional MML practice. An amazing math teacher, if only he would teach Calculus as well.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NjIyNDAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

HW and quizzes are half the grade, but you get infinite tries. DO THEM. Tests are 25%, Final is 25%. He is very good at teaching but finding a reason to drive to Marietta if you're in Kennesaw is tough when you get up for rush hour. Go the class before the test for reviews.

Everything originally had a set due date, but because so many students were having issues, he made it all due the day before the final.
