I've ever had. I suck at math and might even get an A for his class. He's fun and interesting and U can tell he loves his job. His tests can be a bit long and U might get pushed for time but their fair. Go everyday and do the homework and all will be good with him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExNzQyOTEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2005-11-15 17:06:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would recommend him. He was very easy going and always willing to help. His class was not very hard at all and his practice tests go right along with the test.

Before each test, he gives you a practice test with answers. The practice tests are pretty much the same as the actual tests. Very easy going and ALWAYS willing to help.
