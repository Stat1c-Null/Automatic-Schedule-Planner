Her PowerPoints had zero content on them, it was all just problems that she would scramble through class. She gives very little feedback and pop quizzes at the turn of every corner. Overall, just not effective.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzQ3MzMy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

You should go to class in order to learn the new methods it builds into the next class. Quizzes were unannounced, but she always slightly told us when it would be.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjUxMTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

There is not a lot of feedback and the quiz and test felt really hard. I ended up with an A, so its not to bad. I just had to self-teach myself a lot. She is nice and cool, but seemed really busy and not focused on our class.  It was a lot of online reading to learn material","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTMzNjk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3390","date_posted":"2016-04-18 17:06:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Head is one of the best professors I have ever had! She is so helpful, willing to stay after class and clarify anything you were confused about in class. The course matter is difficult to understand some times and she does her best to make it simple! You need to be prepared to read the posted documents and do the homework, but just try.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzIwNTUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2016-03-28 16:21:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"There is a ton of homework in this class. Most of the time it will on be a few problems (1-5) but each problem has 4-5 different parts to do. It's not hard, but very tedious to complete, especially since she doesn't always collect it.  Pop Quizzes are around every corner, and they're not always easy.

She started off with powerpoint notes which were very helpful. Then she started hand outs for notes and that confused me. When she started the handouts i felt like she didn't teach as much. She also allows you to do test corrections for half credit. She doesn't tell the students this so make sure you ask.

The class I took was from 5:00 to 7:45 once a week but we always got out early. Three tests including the final, one in October, one in November, and then the final in December. There is a group project but it is over easy stuff learned in class. All of the homework is on Webassign and the tests are from there.
