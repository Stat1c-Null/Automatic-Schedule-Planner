She really cares about mental health, and made my first education class very fun. She likes to go on tangents though, and doesn't grade until the end of the semester. She has a hard time responding to emails. I recommend going to office hours if you have questions. Course has modules due every weekend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODkxMDQ2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MAED6414","date_posted":"2018-11-05 21:10:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Sanchez gives you time to be flexible in the class and share what you have learned in the teaching field. If you try to take advantage of the grading situation and let the work pile up, then you are going to be in for a surprise when it is ALL due at the end of the semester.
