Extremely generous with her free time by offering regular help sessions.  If you don't get a good grade in her class, it's your own fault.  Don't be a slacker and expect something for nothing.

She is so interested in how well her students do. I struggled at the start but then she contacted me and when I started going to the help sessions she holds, I started to do well.

She uses the textbook only for homework that you don't have to turn in, but she has created her own little textbook that is much better.
