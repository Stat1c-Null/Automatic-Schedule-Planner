Isn't polite, doesn't explain assignments, changes due dates/ doesn't use blackboard well so it's easy to miss assignments by accident because he moves them around.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzU0MTE2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2020-10-06 23:57:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"very social professor! He is unique in the way he speaks and presents math, but its one of the bests ways to learn. Its also one of the many reasons he is loved. Don't take aleks for granted, aleks is much better than what other universities use especiallly against pearson.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjgyOTIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?

He is one of the most dedicated teachers I've had but his broken English is hard to understand especially when you barely understand the math. He is a great guy but I taught myself more than he did. I only took his class because it was the last open math class. Don't take this.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjE5Mjgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2020-01-16 02:18:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"His accent is very heavy which makes him hard to understand but if you go for help individually he will take the time to help you succeed in his class. Study guides matched the tests which made it easier! Take home quizzes that were easy 100s. Aleks was a pain but make sure to do well on the first knowledge test so you dont have a lot of topics.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODQwODQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He is super willing to work with you to get a good grade by letting you redo things and offering help.

Procrastination is your worst enemy for this class. The quizzes are take home and the test are identical to the review he makes. The part I hated about this class was ALEkS. It's a real chore, especially since maybe 2% of the material on it is actually on the test. Once you get past that and his accent, he's not a bad professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDIxNzI4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2019-11-13 05:08:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a very good professor once you get past his accent.
