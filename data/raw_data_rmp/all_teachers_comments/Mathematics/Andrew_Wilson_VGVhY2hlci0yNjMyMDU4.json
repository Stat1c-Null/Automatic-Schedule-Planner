He doesn't throw too much at you, his quizzes and tests cover the topics but do not make it too complicated, he helps a lot and makes learning harder things like proof by induction easy.

He records and uploads his lectures and notes. Attendance wasn't mandatory. This class is lecture heavy. His homework is based on examples from the lectures and on paper. He's accessible outside class and responds to emails quickly. The reviews for his 3 midterms help, but the actual tests have more content than the review.
