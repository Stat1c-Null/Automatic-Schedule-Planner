She gives study guides for each test and gives you 5 bonus points on the test if you complete them. You also get to use an index card for each test and exempt the final if you have an A in the class and 3 or less absences. She is great!!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODg3MTc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--CARES ABOUT STUDENTS--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2016-04-28 09:44:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Edwards has been my FAVORITE professor at KSU so far. Her powerpoint are very to the point with plenty of examples. If you're confused she will help you&explain in a more clear way. Everything is online, but go to class and it's an EASY A. Study guides for the test are worth 5 extra bonus points. You get an index \"cheat\" card every test.

She explains concepts really well (note: I am terrible at math) and she gives study guides for each test. If you complete the study guide and turn it in the day of the test you get 5 extra points on the test! Also, if you have an A and less than 3 absences at the end of the semester you can exempt the final.

I thought I would struggle with statistics, but I actually did very well. If you complete the study guide she gives you and turn it into her on test day, she gives you extra credit.

Posts all notes and powerpoints on D2L. Also gives a lot a practice problems which really helps. Allows us to turn in study guides for extra credit which are basically  the test, drops the lowest quiz grade if you don't miss more than 3 days and you get to exempt the final if you have an A. Highly recommend her.

Lectures from power points, All power points can be accessed through D2L, Lectures were generally short so we got out early, Study guides are provided, and you get extra credit for turning in the study guide prior to the test.
