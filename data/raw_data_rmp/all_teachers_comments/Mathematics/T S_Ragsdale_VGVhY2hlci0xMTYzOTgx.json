She is such a great teacher. I am usually really bad at math but she makes it very understandable. Make sure you go to class, because she can tend to go kind of fast on things. Also, she is happy to answer or go over any question or problem you may have. I highly recommend taking her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDM0Njgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2010-03-30 10:06:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not like her. she goes way too fast and assumes you know things.Big mistake taking her. I learned more from teaching myself and having a tutor. She knows the material but does not deliver well in my opinion.

Online homework required, book homework not required. Tests always have bonuses. Always takes the time to explain something if you don't understand. Recommend. Don't buy the book unless you plan to do the extra homework, which is good practice, but you can always practice with the online homework also.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzgzMjc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2009-05-24 17:50:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"4 tests and a final, some quizzes on the chapters, and a lot of homework; online (graded) and out of the book (not graded).  Gauge how much personal homework to do by how well you do on the quizzes.  I got by doing only the online homework and got an A.  \r She teaches well enough, but make sure you ask questions if you don't understand something.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODkxOTQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2009-01-05 15:19:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this class!
