I have made As in ever other math class but I am struggling to get a C. The last test average was a 46. He is a total jerk and completely useless in class. You might as well take the class online because he is no help at all. You would at least save your time if you took it online.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDY3MjE2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2010-04-21 12:53:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice man, bad teacher.

The examples in class are okay, but Im really just barely able to learn and pass from the homework on mathXL. He's alright, but only if you already have a grasp on the subject AND you are willing to do tons of independent studying. You don't learn in the class, you just review really.

I had him for College Algebra, and he explains everything VERY well, he is ALWAYS willing to help, and as long as you show up to class, you should get an A.
