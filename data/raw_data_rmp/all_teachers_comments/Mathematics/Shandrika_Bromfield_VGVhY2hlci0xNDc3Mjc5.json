I've been out of high school for 19 years.  I was extremely nervous about having to take a college math course because math was always my weakness.  Prof Bromfield is the most patient professor I've had EVER.  She everything down to simpliest terms.  If you struggle in math she is te perfect professor for you.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4ODI2MzEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2010-09-17 19:31:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Bromfield is awesome at teaching math. I am a social science major and hated math before having her teach it to me. She is a high school teacher so she knows how to teach challenging students the material. Doing homework regularly is advised for competency.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTk5NTg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
