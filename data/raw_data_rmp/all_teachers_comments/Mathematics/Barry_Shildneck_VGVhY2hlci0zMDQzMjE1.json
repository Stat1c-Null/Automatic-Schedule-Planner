It was math so the homework wasn't the most fun but I did enjoy his lectures and he provided amazing notes that you could write on and it made everything so much more clear. Truly a wonderful professor!

His tests are easy. I barely made to his class and still ending up with A+. (I am not recommending this if you are not good at math.) The study guides are similar to tests.

He gives good explanations for his lectures. Sadly, I didn't pass due to my procrastination and not finishing Aleks in time. Honestly, to pass, you just need to put in the work and memorization. The exams are easy if you study, and he will provide study guides exactly like the tests that are given.

He uses notes made by the university, which is not really relevant to his method of doing the equations. His grading is very clear and ALEKS heavy and he will break down questions in the notes. However, he does not post notes online, fix ALEKS grades, or respond in a hasty manner.

I spend hours on ALEK's doing practice problems, and I go over my notes every night before bed. If you go to lecture and put in the work at home, you will thrive in this class.
