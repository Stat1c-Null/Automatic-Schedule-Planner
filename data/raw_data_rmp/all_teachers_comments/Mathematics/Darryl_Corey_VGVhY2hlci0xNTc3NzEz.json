He tends to be big on group work and finding out the answers without his help. Just show up to class and do the homework and you will pass.

He randomly changes dates on you and doesn't warn you, and you just never know when ANYTHING is due. DO NOT TAKE his online class! Idk what he is like in class, but his online class has been horrible! Maybe it has to do with the switch to D2L, but it's so not organized and stressful","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTMwOTcw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3317","date_posted":"2012-07-27 18:44:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"ONLINE CLASS!

However, he is pretty reasonable and fair if you approach him about a problem, and he does give you some credit for trying. His class is pretty hard, you'll definitely earn your grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTcyNDU5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
