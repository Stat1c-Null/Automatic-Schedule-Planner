With that being said I was able to get an A in the class. This required doing ALL of the online quizzes, homework, and or course A LOT of studying. In other words get ready to spend many nights and long weekends learning statistics. Unless your a masochist, don't take this class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTM3NDgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2014-04-30 01:14:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her test are nothing like the homework or problems from the book.

Is she a great teacher? no, does she work with you? absolutely! If you show up to every class and make an A you don't have to take the final! And with homework literally being 55% of your grade, its not hard to make a good grade. You willl have to teach yourself a little bit.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTQ3ODk4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2013-12-12 21:35:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is worst professor I have ever had!

She is rude and unapproachable and has strict office hours that you cannot even go see her for.  She's always late for class and still expects us to take exams in <40 minutes.

She should not be a teacher. She is petty, rude, inconsiderate, condescending and unknowledgable. She was late 90% of the time. On an exam day, she was 20+ minutes late. She still expected students to take the exam. She told one student they'd have to choose between her exam and their next class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzg5NDM3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2013-11-08 10:54:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"This instructor is not approachable at all.

Homework due dates vary day-to-day and if she decides to change a homework grade overnight, do not expect an e-mail and do not wait for an in class announcement or it will be too late.

Her notes are unclear and the homework she gives doesn't help at all with what was \"learned\" in class. She's hard to understand because of the way she talks and will change things on the test while you are taking it. I would just suggest on not even trying to take this woman as your teacher.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMDc0MTA4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
