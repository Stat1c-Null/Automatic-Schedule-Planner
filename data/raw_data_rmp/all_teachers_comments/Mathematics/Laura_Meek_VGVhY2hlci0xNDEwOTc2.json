She is very easy and gives a TON of extra credit, I used the textbook for the first test then never again after that because we started doing homework and quizzes online..

Loads of extra credit, take home test, nightly graded HW, quizzes, attendance mand but you need to be there to know how to do homework, final project is all semester and very easy if done gradually.

Kind of a monkey-see-monkey-do approach to statistics. Great class to learn about Excel. Homework can be difficult but all you need to do is try and you get credit. Tests are mult-choice take-home.
