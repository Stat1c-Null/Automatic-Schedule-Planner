He lectures every day, but makes class interesting and is willing to help you with any questions that you may have. There are 7 quizzes (lowest grade dropped) and 3 tests. You can use a 3x5 notecard on all tests and quizzes. This class is an easy A if you go to class and pay attention. Would recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODU2MDMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Clear grading criteria--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
