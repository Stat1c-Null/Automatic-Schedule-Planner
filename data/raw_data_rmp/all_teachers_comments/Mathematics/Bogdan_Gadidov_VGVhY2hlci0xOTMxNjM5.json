Everything is straight forward, and the tests are exactly what you learn in class. If you have trouble going to class, he's pretty cute, so you have some motivation to go.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDg5Nzk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107","date_posted":"2014-12-04 00:47:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's awesome. He's young so he's very laid back during classes. If you don't understand something, he'll find a way to get you to understand. Tests  consist of exactly what he teaches in class. No tricks up his sleeve, but he does have the occasional corny math joke lol  I'd definitely take him again if I could.

Never made less than an A on anything in his class - granted I studied a lot but he really TEACHES all the material, and reviews over and over. Fantastic, clear teacher.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzQ0MDc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2014-10-28 17:47:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's super clear and cares about the success of his students! Math never came easy for me, but in this class I am doing the best I've ever done (never made a B on any of his tests). Homework is assigned weekly with a week or more until the due date - work ahead!! Definitely take his class if you can!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzA2NjE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
