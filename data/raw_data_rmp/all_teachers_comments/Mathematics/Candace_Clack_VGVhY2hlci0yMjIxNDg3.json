You do not need to have a rigorous understanding of coding in SAS. Statistics mean nothing if you cannot articulate your evidence in agreed-upon terms. Grammar, writing, and vocabulary are needed to articulate yourself.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDA0NzAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3130","date_posted":"2020-07-26 23:04:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Clack is a good professor, but there are a few test questions I believe there was a disconnect on. Topics that were never covered, but are still thrown on. The class isn't super difficult, just make sure to understand how to work out SAS code and solve certain things by hand. Do the practice exams, she'll either reuse or have similar ?'s.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTM1Njc1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3130","date_posted":"2020-05-13 19:32:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a tough grader when it comes to reports.
