I cannot recommend him enough, I am horrific at math but this professor is so caring, understanding, and relatable and makes sure everyone is set up to succeed. the only problem is Alex but that's not something he can control but does a good job at preparing you for it.

I've spoke with other friends taking the same course and their professors were comparably more difficult. His lectures are easy to comprehend and straight to the point, offers extra credit opportunities, and genuinely wants you to succeed. He prepares you for tests and the only \"hard\" part is catching up with aleks.

ALEKS heavy, so get ready to teach yourself to learn. Tests are in person and sometimes he curved the tests. Very lenient with adhering more time for assignments. But beware, the ALEKS assignments are about 15% of your grade so don't get caught behind.
