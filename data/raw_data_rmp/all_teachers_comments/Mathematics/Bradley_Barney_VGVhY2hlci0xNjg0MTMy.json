Very accessible, works hard to answer questions in 2-3 ways, so ensure that the student understands the answer. His goofy jokes break up what could be a monotonous lecture.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODE5MDA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3125","date_posted":"2016-01-19 19:13:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor.

Pretty boring class, but he teaches it well. Midterm, final, major project and lots of homework/quizzes. Content is super simple + all ppts are loaded onto d2L. Lectures are sometimes dry and seem to go on forever. Will often try to make jokes and lighten the mood a bit. Usually goes over quizzes before submitting.

If you are required to take biostat HELP YOURSELF BY TAKING HIM. I had to retake the class after taking Ferguson (stay away fromher, can't stress that enough) and he clarified everything about stats that I was not able to teach myself previously. He is SUPER NICE and really gets the whole class interested.

His powerpoint, things he writes on the board, and practice is all you need to pass this class. If you have a question, ask it. He will not shut you down. He has quizzes occasionally, and most of the time they are one question: \"where you here today?\" Excellent teacher!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzA4OTgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL3125","date_posted":"2014-05-02 12:46:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Barney is not helpful.

He tries very hard to help, and is very patient with students. Some people are going to struggle; this is not an easy subject. I struggled myself, but through nobody's fault but my own.
