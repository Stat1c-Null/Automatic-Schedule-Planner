He is interesting and clearly cares about students.  10 extra points on tests for perfect attendance.  Weekly quizzes and homework to be turned in, but he gives you a practice test before the real one which covers the exact material on the real test.  He's great and fun, and I learned a lot!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NjA5NjIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3332","date_posted":"2009-03-18 08:01:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"I wish all the math professors teach with the same passion. Attendance not mandatory but if you don't miss a day you'll get 10 point toward your final grade. Tests are hard if you don't do the homework and quiz. Fun class! he is extremely helpful. Some math teachers should learn from him. Should be nominated Teacher of the YEAR","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTQyMjcx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3332","date_posted":"2009-02-11 07:42:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"He likes to show you how you can apply what you learn to real life problems. If you do the homework and study the material and you think logically, you'd do well in his class. If you don't plan to do the work, avoid him. You can't cram for his tests. I got an A but I had to work hard for it. And I will take him again for any class he teaches.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NDU2MjMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2009-01-07 21:53:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was not good at explaining things and would get other students to do it for him. His tests are nothing like what he says they will be and does NOT do a good study before the test at all. He makes you do problems on your own and will not explain as you go to review. Not recommended for someone who is not stellar in math classes!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzM3MDU0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2008-10-27 20:44:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"He helps you and explains things a lot.

He's willing to work with you, very helpful, he's all into teaching you SAS, not required to learn it but there are lot of homeworks and tests based on SAS. Tests are fair, quiz and homework every week. He makes class interesting.
