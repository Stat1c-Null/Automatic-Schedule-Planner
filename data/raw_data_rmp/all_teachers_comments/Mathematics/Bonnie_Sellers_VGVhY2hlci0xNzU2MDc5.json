I thank her for her patience and assistance. Come to class and do the work. Seek help if needed. You pay for the Math Lab, use it, It also helped me.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODc1ODkz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH0097","date_posted":"2015-05-06 05:47:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's nice.

As long as you show up, do the homework (which are 10 problems a week) and do the practice tests ( I usually would do about 4-5 before the actual test) then you should be ok. She was extremely helpful and I had no trouble following her in class. Do the homework on the site as well bc that helped me.

There was homework about once a week but only 10 problems and she lets you turn in late homework for full credit. She's really understanding and will let you make up a test if you can't attend class.
