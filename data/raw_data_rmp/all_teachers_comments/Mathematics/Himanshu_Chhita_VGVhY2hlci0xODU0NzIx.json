He gave us a ton of chances to do well in the class, so I got a really good grade.

I'm not a math person & I honestly got lucky having him teach my statistics class! The material is difficult but he takes the time to break down the chapters sections to figure out which sections should be taught first & how to minimize confusion. If he's teaching take his class! =)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzYyNTU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
