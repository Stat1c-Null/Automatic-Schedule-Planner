Tests are open notes and she offers bonus points. Homework can be tedious but it is helpful. Final is extremely easy. I would take her again!

She was awesome but to me the end of the course was hard.  She gives a lot of help with your grade, many opportunities to pass. The homework and quizzes count more then the tests to take some pressure off because math is the devil.

This was a hybrid course, so we learned material on our own and she would explain it in class. 3 exams, 1 final divided into 2 parts. Funny, and entertaining. Homework is mandatory to do, 10 quizzes.

She's very helpful and explain anything over and over again until you understand it.  Allows a cheatsheet front and back.  Setups exam so you can pass as long as you try.  Must keep up with homework and quizzes, hw can be done as many times until you achieve 100, but not easy, quizzes are easy.

Took as a hybrid, so attendance is taken every week and required to pass. Homework is due before each of the 3 tests, and final replaces the lowest of the 3 test grades. This god sent from heaven allows a full page front and back cheat sheet for every test, so tests are EASY.

Very open to student feedback and is willing to alter things to accommodate the majority opinion of the class and will go out of her way to answer any questions you have and returns emails promptly.

She was very nice and very funny! There was a quiz atleast once a week. and there were three tests. one was take home and on another you could have a cheat sheet. the final was very easy and half was take home and she pretty much gave you the other half in a study guide.
