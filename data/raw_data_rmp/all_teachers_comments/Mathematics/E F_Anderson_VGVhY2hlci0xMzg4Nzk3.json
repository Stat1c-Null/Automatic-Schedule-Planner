She explained things so I could understand them.  She also gets you prepared for the Compasss test.  I have made B's in all my other math classes, but this was my first A in algebra.  Take her if you can; you won't regret it.  She's the BEST!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDk0MzM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH0098","date_posted":"2011-06-09 12:48:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor told our class that this was her first time teaching at KSU. I did take her a while back and I am just now getting around to rating. She was very new it seemed and it was almost as if she was teaching you as if you already knew. It looks from the comments now that this had changed and that is great.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NzE1Mzc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH0098","date_posted":"2011-05-02 12:47:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the best Math teach Ive had. She's easy going and makes herself available to all her students, don't miss a class because you might miss some important information. her class is so enjoyable that you wouldn't want to miss a class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTA2NjU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH0097","date_posted":"2011-02-07 00:57:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I LOVE HER! SHE MAKES MATH SO SIMPLE AND SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND! SHE WONT MOVE ON UNTIL EVRYONE GETS IT, SO IF YOU DONT SPEAK UP! SHE WILL ANSWER EVERY QUESTION WITHOUT MAKING YOU FEEL STUPID!

Formulas explained percisely.  If you're taking this class, take Ms Anderson.  Her teaching will help you pass the compass.  The class is 4-test and a final, which can throw out your lowest score.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTA2OTM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH0097","date_posted":"2010-12-04 00:26:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME. I cannot recommend Professor Anderson enough. I don't think I've ever made an 'A' in a math class before. Her teaching style is so wonderful -- laid-back, and makes the material a breeze to learn. She always makes sure everyone knows what they're doing before she will move on. If you suck at math, TAKE HER.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODU3Njg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH0098","date_posted":"2010-12-01 12:00:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you are a non-trad student ,take Ms Anderson for Math 98.

The class is four tests and a final, but she will drop your lowest test score. There are four homework assignments that do count toward your grade but they are only ten questions each. Very helpful with answering questions during or after class. I would definitely take her class again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDU1MTEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
