All the tests are easy after completing practice test, so take good notes !","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjI4MDA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
