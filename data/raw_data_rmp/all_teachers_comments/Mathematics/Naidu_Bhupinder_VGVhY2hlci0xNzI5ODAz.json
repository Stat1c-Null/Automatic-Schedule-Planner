She rushes all of her lectures but sometimes she still runs class long. I did better teaching myself than learning from her, and I still barely scraped by. If you struggle with math, she doesn't make it any easier.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzA5MTkx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Beware of pop quizzes--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2023-04-02 02:42:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"The homework can be completed in a few hours and is ALEKS based, so I'm not sure what people mean by a ton of homework. She really wants you to succeed and has gone out of her way to help. You can not skip homework and lectures and expect to pass or understand the material.

She teaches very thoroughly and will explain if you ask questions. She does assign a lot of homework on ALEKS, but it's honestly super helpful and gives great practice. She gives you a practice test on ALEKS before exams, and they are almost exactly the same. I 10/10 recommend her for college algebra!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTIyODM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2023-03-10 05:44:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"She makes college algebra even easier than it is.
