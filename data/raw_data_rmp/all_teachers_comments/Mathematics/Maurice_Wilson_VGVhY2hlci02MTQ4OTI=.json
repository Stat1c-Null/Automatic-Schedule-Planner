He doesnt use PowerPoints much. He mainly teaches by explaining using reasoning. He is test/quiz heavy. You will have to study hard outside of class, if you dont you wont pass! Dont miss class, study, and you will do great!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODU1NDM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--Skip class?

I wish I could have took him for math 3318. I don't like math, but I loved coming to his class. If he sees that the class is struggling, he gives opportunities for us to improve our grade. He is down to earth and answers your emails fast. His teaching is also easy to follow:)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzI0ODE4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3316AND3317","date_posted":"2015-05-03 02:50:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful professor.... He has sort of a smart mouth but it's funny. It seems like he cares more about if you put in effort than the actual grade you receive. I took him for math 3316 and 3317.

You do have to study and work hard for a  good grade, but you will be glad you did.

Great summer class to take.
