He is also very trigger happy to abuse his power dynamic by bullying students, for ex. he locked me out of the classroom like a 5th grader when I went to use the bathroom. Clearly struggles from short man syndrome and insanely rude. Also doesn't have teaching degree.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNjUwMzQ2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2023-01-09 22:57:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"VERY HARD.
