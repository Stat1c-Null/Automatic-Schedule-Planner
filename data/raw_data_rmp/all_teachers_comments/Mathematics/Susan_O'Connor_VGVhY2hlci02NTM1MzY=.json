The material was explained alright, but the way you really learn it is by revisiting it via homework. She belittles you if you have questions, so take good notes. she also complains about her mishaps and talks about random stuff, like her cats and her divorce. I'd take her again though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTcwMTI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2011-03-23 10:20:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the prof that has explained Statistiscs THE BEST in all my education. She really knows what she is talking about and her tests are exactly like the reviews and the hw she gives (just different numbers). Also, book is pointless to buy cause u wont use it--she posts hw online.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzAyMjky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2010-12-13 01:10:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"She had us waste $60 on the online textbook and then once we activated it, she decided not to use it anymore because she was having computer problems with it. Not helpful at all. If you ask her question she rolls her eyes and acts like it is the biggest request in the world. She does give practice tests which are exactly like the test.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTI1NzQw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2005-08-16 18:22:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you are not in her spaced out world, or on her level of thinking, she will not waster &quot;her time&quot; with you. If you are not just graduating from high school, you will not do well in her class.  Her class is designed for the new freshman, not non-traditional students.
