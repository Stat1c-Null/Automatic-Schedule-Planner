Didnt think I would pass this class at all but she gave so many hances for extra bonus points! Curved lowest test score. She post her slides online right after class.

She decided to burn our second test because it was so bad. It wasnt the lack of calculators or studying. She gives test problems from the book bank and not the book. the book bank is alot harder. not enough time to finish test. does curve if the class did bad as a whole.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDI4MTQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

Math classes always have a high withdrawal rate- people panic after the first test. Math is my worst subject and I made a B, almost an A. You have to go to class and do the work, but I mean... it's math. Flexible and understanding, extra credit opportunities, talented teacher. Take her if this subject scares you.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzUwNTU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2009-01-09 11:36:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Love Ms M!

You have to study but you can get really a good grade in the end.

Lots of extra credit, including a 50 point bonus graphing project at the end. Very open to change about due dates, retaking a test if you missed it isn't ever a problem. A lot of material for an algebra class, she even got into precalc topics. If you slack its easy to fail, but on the other hand getting an A is very doable.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MTI4NzAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2008-10-13 16:12:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"She knows her math but she cannot teach. Withdrawal rate is extremely high. Over 2/3 withdrawal from each class. Test grades are awful across the board in both her classes. We did everything to succeed; attended all classes, did all homework but we were still failing. Math lab; Math XL will not help.
