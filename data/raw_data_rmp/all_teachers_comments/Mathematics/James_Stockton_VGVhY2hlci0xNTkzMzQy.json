It shows that he's been doing this for a while. Show up to class, do your homework and calculus will be (fairly) easy. The final grade (which is multiple choice) replaces your lowest test score. I turned my F into an A. Skills checks and homework are also a pretty good grade booster.

I'm honestly not sure why he has such great reviews, unless you're great with calculus. He tends to brush over things as if we should already know it.
