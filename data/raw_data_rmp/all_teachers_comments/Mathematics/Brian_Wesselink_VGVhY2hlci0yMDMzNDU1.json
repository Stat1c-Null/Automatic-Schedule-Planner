I plan on taking him for Calculus later in my college career. He's very friendly, very understanding, and is always an email away. I enjoyed his class and he made math very bearable.

Hes such a sweet man and always offers study sessions before every test. There is online homework every night you have class, but its easy. The tests are very similar to the quizzes and practice tests. I would definitely recommend him!!

I took this class in the previous semester with a different professor and failed the class so I had to retake it. I am not very good at math but I got an A! He gives extra points to your final grade for good attendance. Homework is not mandatory, but you have a quiz each class over it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MTE1ODM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
