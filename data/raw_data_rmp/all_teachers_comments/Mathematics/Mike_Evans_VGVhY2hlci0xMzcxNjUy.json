NOT TRUE AT ALL! when you get the test, the questions are hard. I have not passed a test yet and we are 4 tests in. He seems not to care and he will tell you to go to math lab and SI which are useless.

His tests will not be like what you do in the homework or what is done in class. They will be really hard, so you better find extra practice other than what is given.

I'm a non traditional math major so I'm serious about school. Never miss a class, do all homework and study a ton extra. I have gotten 50s on 2 of 4 tests. EXTREMELY difficult. Class spent working on easy examples but the test problems are over the top.

I mean, the class is rather dry, but he helps you through it, makes the information very basic and clear, and tells you exactly what he expects from you. I had him for a Friday 9:30am Trig class, so it had potential to suck, but Evans is a good teacher so it wasn't too bad. I definitely recommend him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjU1MjE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2010-07-23 14:31:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had him for the summer course, class was difficult but the professor was very clear in his expectations.
