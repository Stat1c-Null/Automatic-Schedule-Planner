Would prefer straight answers in class, then can think about it when the subject matter makes sense.  Exams were difficult for more (mean 71 or so).  Not good.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjAxNDY4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3125","date_posted":"2011-04-08 00:53:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great professor. I know many who struggled with the material, but she will help and the tests are exactly what she teaches. I didn't open the book once, but Im good with statistics, I made a 98% in the class without studying, so most ppl should be able to get an A.  Because of this class, I'm considering grad school in statistics!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Mzc2NjIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3125","date_posted":"2011-01-20 10:46:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really great professor. She actually pushes you to understand what you are doing instead of spoon feeding it to you. He tests are very straight forward, no tricks. Homework is optional, but you should definitely do it. Got a B with medium effort. It is definitely possible to get an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MTYyNzQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO3215","date_posted":"2010-11-27 14:01:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very nice nad willing to help if you don/t understand something.

Exams are long and require you to really know what you are doing - if you studied they are easy, sometimes you get to have a cheat sheet. Posts her ppts online and you don't HAVE to go to class, but she gets annoyed if you miss alot..","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDI2MTAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
