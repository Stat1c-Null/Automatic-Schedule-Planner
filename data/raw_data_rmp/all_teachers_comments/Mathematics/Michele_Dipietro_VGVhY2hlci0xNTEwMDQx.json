He knows the material however he is not good at teaching AT ALL.  Instead assessing what he can do better he is quick to blame the students for his short comings.  He's is not helpful, his methods are very convoluted. Do not take any of his classes...RUN","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTQ5MDM0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3332","date_posted":"2011-04-25 10:32:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice guy but this is by far the worst math class I have had. He knows his prob and stat, but I do not believe he knows how to teach it well to his students. He always answers questions about the hw but even then I usually had to consult my hw solution manual. The tests are very hard and only 5 questions but the quizzes atleast always come from hw.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDYyMTA3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
