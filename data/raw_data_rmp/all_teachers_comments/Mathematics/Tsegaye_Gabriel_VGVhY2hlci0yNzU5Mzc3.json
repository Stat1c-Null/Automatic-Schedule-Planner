He never explains the material properly and always speaks as if we already know what he is talking about. At the start of the semester the class was full, by the halfway point only a 3rd of the class was left. I had no choice but to drop out because me and many others were set up for failure","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTIzOTI4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2023-02-24 00:20:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"I personally never like ALEKS. That is all this class is. He just walks through the work quickly and you just fill in the blanks. At the beginning he gives out a huge packet that you work on throughout the semester. Quizzes and homework are fine. But that final, study hard.

There are high school students who can teach agebra better than this guy. If you have this professor, I hope you know everything there is to know about algebra because you'll be teaching yourself.

If you read the notes before class you'll be able to follow along during class. He really wants you to do well and  if you show an interest in getting a good grade, he will honestly try to help.

Attended all classes but he talked so fast with an accent and a mask that I got zero out of the class. Taught myself on the online system. I had an 88 going into the final, but he gave me a zero on the final because he did not like the way I worked out the questions. I got 3 A's and this F.

He does not explain anything and does not teach well. He also has a very strong accent and wears a mask so unless you're in the front row you cant hear/understand him. Doesnt post notes either and goes at a quick pace during class time. Doesnt understand concept of teaching but rather just tells/says","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTI3NjEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Beware of pop quizzes--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2022-11-30 22:57:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"It is tough to interpret what he is saying because of his accent and the fact he wears a mask. He does not have any respect for students and replies with an attitude to make you feel stupid. Had to teach myself through ALEKS because he overcomplicates things. The worst professor ever and tells more than he teaches.

You have to learn everything on you're own. He's difficult to understand and with masks now, it's even harder.

I would even say that, even if you are a good learner on your own, the amount of work he gives is completely absurd. Part of it is definitely how I am disgusted with math in general, but my point still stands.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjY1NzUx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"F","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
