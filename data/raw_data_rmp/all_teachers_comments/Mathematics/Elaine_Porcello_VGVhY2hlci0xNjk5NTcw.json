Then allows as much of a class period as needed for review & clarifications. Is EXCELLENT one-on-one; will make time for you when needed. Has very clear expectations on grading & homework, but is very understanding. Very kind and hard working.

She only will help during school hours if you have extra time, no mornings or afternoons. Tests and quizzes include a lot of info not gone over in class, and if you don't understand the chapter 100% just start praying to St. Albert the Great.

Run fast. Run far.  All kidding aside this professor was a really bad fit for me.  I would never normally not like a person because of something they cannot control but her lisp makes lectures almost impossible to understand.

Her lectures were fine, just pay attention. If you miss a lecture you will regret it. I aced every test, but she is a very strict grader. Double check your graded work for her errors.
