She copies problems from the book but often makes mistakes from rushing. Several people have dropped the class and of the few left, most are failing because they don't have time to go to tutoring on top of attending her class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjgwOTI4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH0098","date_posted":"2010-04-21 13:30:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher made learning easy.
