Talks way too fast and erases the board before you can finish writing down notes. The homework is not turned in and is just textbook exercises that he does not go over. Tests are very hard even with the curve. I strongly advise against taking him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzIwNjc0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH2345","date_posted":"2018-05-10 10:53:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely intelligent, very fast in his explanations. He expects you to read the material and come to class with a solid foundation. His lectures are usage lectures, not teaching you the concepts. There is no easy way to teach this class, he encourages you to implement via the tests. Really makes you think, curve is appropriate. Learned alot.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDU0MDE4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Expect test averages to be around the 30s and 40s, and don't expect to be able to take notes easily. Most people resort to taking pictures with their phone. You will have to teach yourself, and be very fast to finish the test. Most people literally couldn't finish the tests in time.

He quickly writes a complicated problem on the board while attempting to explain it as he goes. You spend 100% of your brain power trying to write everything down in time and and 0% on hearing and understanding. I spent a lot of time on YouTube to better understand the material.

Tests are 12 questions worth 10 points each, but are incredibly difficult. Open notes and open book but it doesn't help much. TAKE LOTS OF DETAILED NOTES.

He's difficult to understand, can't copy an example problem from the book without making mistakes, and doesn't plan tests early enough to space them out. We had test 4 the last class period before the final.

He filled the board with formulas and didn't bother explaining them.  Made numerous mistakes in examples and wouldn't go back and fix them.  Spoke very quickly, very thick accent, and mumbled.

He will blaze through the material and explain very little. He will take the examples in the book and work them out on the board while making occasional mistakes.
