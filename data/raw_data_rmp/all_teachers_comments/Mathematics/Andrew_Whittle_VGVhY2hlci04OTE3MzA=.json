Your grade will reflect how much work you put into it.  Go to class, take notes, and do the homework.  You'll do fine.

The guy doesn't stop smiling.  He is the most helpful prof i have come across to the point he'll even help you DURING the test.  Easy to talk to, unintimidating, and doesn't make you feel stupid for asking something.  Do the hw and understand it for an A.  He is hard to get a hold of in vista and in his office.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NzgxMTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2008-12-11 15:31:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Whittle is such a great professor! He really wants his students to succeed and will explain anything until you understand it. There are 8 pop quizzes and 1 midterm and a final but if you do all the hw then you should do fine on the pop quizzes.

Understands the calculus course to the fullest and more. Makes calculus fairly easy. Explains and answers any questions completely. Only grades in class are unannounced quizzes and tests (problems are from the homework assigned or very similar). Great professor. Highly recommended.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTU3NTQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2008-07-31 13:30:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Anyone who could get me to learn calc is amazing in my eyes.

He is so understanding with his students. If we do not understand a complex calculus problem, he will make sure that we do not leave until we do understand it.

He explains calculus very well. I also give him props for writing all of his notes on the board. He's a sweetheart if you ever talk to him. He also grades the fairest that I've ever seen.
