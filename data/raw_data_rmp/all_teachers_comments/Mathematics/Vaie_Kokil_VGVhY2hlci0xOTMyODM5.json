The method in the book was not the same method taught in the homework and quizzes online.  The online system should be abandoned.  She is a great teacher, just needs some practice communicating with students and ensuring that the concepts are thoroughly conveyed instead of introducing two separate concepts.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTMxMjU4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

There is online hw and quizzes for grades. They are not too hard and answers are provided. Index card for notes can be used on exams. Attendance is not mandatory but I would find it hard to pass not going and she offers bonus points during them, which can raise you a whole letter grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODMzNTUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3332","date_posted":"2016-01-15 15:28:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class is difficult. She doesn't prepare you well for tests and grades very harshly with little to no partial credit. That being said, she's very nice and cares about your grades. She'll work with you and gives extra credit / makeup opportunities should you choose to take them. I got an A in the class despite having bad test grades.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTQ3NjY1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2015-01-07 21:02:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor. Hawkes online homework is very frustrating but she was able to contact them and change their system so you can miss more than 2 questions and you won't have to start over plus she changes the number of questions each homework session and gives easier questions. Test are pretty easy. Quizzes every week only 2 questions. Take her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjUwMzU5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2015-01-06 11:26:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her bark is worse than her bite. While she does have a thick accent,not that difficult to understand. Believes in tough love, but IS there to help.  Gives extra credit.  If you have a question outside of class, ASK.  She emails back very quickly.  Participate.  If you don't volunteer and answer, she will volunteer you anyway.

We used the textbook for the first few weeks, then moved completely to online. It's fast paced, but not impossible to keep up. You need to spend time outside of class studying or you wont do well.  you cant just show up to class and expect to learn everything that you need. OVERALL: Wasn't the worst.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTE3NzY1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
