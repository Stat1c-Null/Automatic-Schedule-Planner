You have to do it exactly his way or you don't get points. Grade consists of 4 tests. He goes by coach Sims, so a lot of people review him by that name. He doesn't use the text book, he makes up his own notes so you do not have anything to look at besides your notes.

He is rather unclear from time to time, and occasionally will mess up the problems he shows us in class.

Every math class I have ever taken in college I've made A's in and I made a C in his class. He does not use a book so there is nothing to reference other than your notes. He has pop quizzes so you need to go to class. Although the material may seem easy, his test questions are way more advance then how he explains things.

However, it ended up being the hardest class I think I'll ever take. Taught things that didn't exist in order to teach things that do (&#63;).
