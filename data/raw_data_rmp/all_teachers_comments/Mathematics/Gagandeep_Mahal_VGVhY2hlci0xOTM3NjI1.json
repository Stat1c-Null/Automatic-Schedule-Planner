Professor Mahal is not a good teacher if you need a lot of guidance in math. She's very kind, but her class is very hard and she is confusing. Lessons are confusing and tests are even worse, MAN, the test problems ARE THE WORST! they're 20x's harder than necessary. DO NOT take this class if math isn't for you.
