Proof writing is very abstract math, and there is plenty of that here. She is very pleasant and easy going, but I' not sure she relates the material well during class. Did some office hours, which helped, but difficult with a full schedule. I'm just glad it's over!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDY5NzY1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3390","date_posted":"2011-06-02 22:38:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is hard as heck, but she does a great job of helping (especially during office hours).

She was the one of the best teachers I have had.  Really tough material, alot to learn alot to know, test are difficult, projects are hard too, gets better towards the end.  You MUST study. She is cool and too the point teaches material but you have to understand it by studing. Strap your chin strap or you might loose your head.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTc2OTM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3390","date_posted":"2010-12-09 09:32:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is extremely helpful and will explain everything to you. She may seem hard in class but her tests are pretty fair if you have studied alot. Its college... you have to study hard if you want to do well. Some of the class doesnt seem to understand this and thus does poorly. Would definitly take Dr. Gardner again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODk0NjYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3390","date_posted":"2010-03-24 12:50:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"very nice, very helpful. class is extremely difficult and most of the class does poorly on the tests and quizes.She is a good teacher and gives lots of examples in class, the material covered is just very hard. study and practice and you will pass. much better than derado (the only other prof for 3390)!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTA0NzU4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
