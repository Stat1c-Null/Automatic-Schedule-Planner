He will sometimes appear disheveled, and he tends to talk far too quietly and far too little. His class is not too difficult though, and he is friendly and readily offers help, but he is weak in class lessons. Great teacher if you already expect to do well. Not wonderful for those who need help with the subject.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzcxMjM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2011-11-03 10:38:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is brand new this semester. He doesn't usually talk much. The very first day it was 50 minutes of him writing on the board and saying se you tommorow. Yeah you get cheat sheets for the tests but you HAVE to ask for them. Probably his only redeeming quality is that he speaks English and he does help you hut you have to go to him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTUzMjE0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2011-11-01 14:25:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is honestly a new teacher, very quiet and not that great at answering questions. Lot of times he has to get help from the students, but over all an easy A if you just get with a friend and study the homeworks he assigns. He allows cheat sheets also. So really easy tests short and simple.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTM4NzE4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
