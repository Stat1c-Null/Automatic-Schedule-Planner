I felt like she expected our class to preform at th esame level as her AP high school students. I have a hard time with this class anyways b/c it's being forced on me. I feel that Ms. G moved way too quickly. Her dry sense of humor appealed to me, but we never &quot;clicked&quot;.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTQ5MTYw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH098","date_posted":"2009-03-26 08:47:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"At frist I wasn't going to take her because of what I read about her on here but I had no choice. She was a good teacher, be sure when you take your test you write out the work because if you made one mistake she will give you the credit anyway. Don't buy the book because she never use it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTcwMzE4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH0098","date_posted":"2009-01-09 10:25:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"She can make you feel dumb if you ask questions during class, but she is more than happy to discuss questions and/or problems after class. This can be good if there is a real dullard in your class, and you have to wait 15 minutes to move to the next problem when 95% of the class understands it already. Book not necessary, all on My Math Lab.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzQ1NjYx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH098","date_posted":"2008-06-05 23:05:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you have any trouble in Math at all this is the wrong TEACHER!

You can tell her to slow down and she normally will. Like many other professors here, she has a full-time job so availability is limited but you can use the math lab for help.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzODM2NDI5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH097","date_posted":"2006-06-13 16:02:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher!
