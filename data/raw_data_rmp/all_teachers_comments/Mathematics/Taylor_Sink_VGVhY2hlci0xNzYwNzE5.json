She gives ONE example per concept and then you have another example for homework. For all the variances that come up under a single concept, it's not enough. She also is pretty bad about explaining connections between concepts, and so it's all rather choppy.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTIxMDM2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2012-12-12 21:20:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Greatest math teacher I ever had.

She provides chapter walkthroughs that you must print out online and has tests on each chapter. If you struggle with math, you will get lost when she teaches. USE THE MATH LAB FOR HELP.
