Her class can be long and boring at times, but she is a very involved and makes the class worth attending. Class is mandatory and u get 5 free days to miss, but I recommend going. Do the hw, the class is fast paced. She gives out extra credit and drops 3 out of 6 of the lowest quiz grades. She's super awesome.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODA1Mzk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2010-05-09 21:50:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great professor!

If she's teaching...take her.  She's also a HS math teacher so not on campus alot but she does respond to email.  Give good example and quizes often.  I cracked the textbook one time but I understand math pretty well.  Got an easy A and went on to 1106 with the knowledge from her and managed a solid A there as well.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMTgxNzI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1106","date_posted":"2006-11-18 16:24:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"great prof...im really bad in math and she made it easier to understand...she is real nice too...i totally recommend her","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNDQ1MzE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COLLEGEALGEBRA","date_posted":"2006-01-03 12:23:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Scar is awesome!!  She makes it very easy to understand what could potentially be really confusing math problems.  She does a daily quiz every day, so you don't want to miss class at all!  She's tedious, but very helpful and very nice!  I would definitely recommend her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExMjkzMjUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2005-11-17 16:47:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love her! She is so organized, it's amazing. I wish all teachers were as clear and prepared as she is. She emails you the outlines and examples for each class, all you have to do is print them out and show up with a pencil and a calculator!  She also gives chances for extra credit on each test and throughout the semester.  Fantastic teacher!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEwOTM3NzYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2005-08-16 18:13:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"great teacher","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEwMTMwMzU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2005-06-15 19:01:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"SHE IS AWESOME!!!
