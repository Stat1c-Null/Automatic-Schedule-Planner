I didn't find his teaching methods efficient or useful. Homework must always be turned in, and while attendance isn't mandantory, it is hard to catch up after missing just one class. He skims over the material very quickly. He's a very nice man but not a very helpful professor.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MjAyNjI3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2008-06-10 00:48:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a nice guy.  Not necessarily easy, but he goes the extra length to be fair while still making sure you comprehend the material.
