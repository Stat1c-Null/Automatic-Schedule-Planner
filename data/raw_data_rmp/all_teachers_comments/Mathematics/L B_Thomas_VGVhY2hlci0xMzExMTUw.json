He will go over problems in class but skip steps that he can do in his head. He also is extremely insulting when you ask questions - calling people dyslexic, and asking how they passed the previous classes, etc. Makes you embarrassed to ask questions. Classes are pointless.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODU5NTc3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2011-12-14 20:10:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not sure why everyone is upset here, he was a really nice guy and his class was fairly simple. im not a math guy, but he helped me improve for sure. always there to help. takes attendance but you dont really NEED to be there. tests are straight forward. online homework is SO easy, basically gives you the answers in class. plenty of time to do also.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTExOTIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1106","date_posted":"2010-07-15 00:58:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"What to say about Professor Thomas.  Well, his lectures were not very clear most of the time.  His idea of reviewing for a test was going over the study guide.  What he should have done was show the students step - by step how to go over the problems.  He tried to incorperate Math xl into the lectures way more than was necessary.

Alot of homework online that is mandatory. Practice test are replicals of his exact test. And He goes over the homework in class if u ask questions.
