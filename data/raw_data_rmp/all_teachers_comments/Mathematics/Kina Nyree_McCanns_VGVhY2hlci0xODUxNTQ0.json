However, Professor McCanns makes it very easy to learn. She's also very kind and will answer every single person's question even if it consumes twenty minutes of class time. Make sure to stay on top of everything and you'll do fine.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTY2NzA3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1117","date_posted":"2014-01-08 00:40:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very helpful friendly and nice.
