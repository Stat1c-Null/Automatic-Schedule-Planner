She is super helpful and understanding, and does what she can to make you understand. Do not buy the book. Her study guides are not helpful.

She provided multiple examples and made sure to appeal to each learning style. She is also a very fair grader. Drops two lowest homework grades, lowest quiz grade, and replaces your lowest test grade with that section of the final.
