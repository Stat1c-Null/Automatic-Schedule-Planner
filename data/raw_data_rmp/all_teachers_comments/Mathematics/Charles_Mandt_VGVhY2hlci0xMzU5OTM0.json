He is a little hard to understand due  to his pneumonia, but he answers all questions thoroughly and doesn't teach too fast. The only setback would have to be the amount of homework assigned.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzQ0NTIx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
