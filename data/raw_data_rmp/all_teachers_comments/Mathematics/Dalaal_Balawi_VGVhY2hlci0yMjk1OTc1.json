She makes sure you know the information. Yes she teaches a little fast but she does a great job of explaining. Easy A if you go to class and pay attention. The my math lab HW has never helped me personally but study before the test and quizzes . She drops the lowest quiz and replaces lowest test with the final grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU3NTYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2017-11-08 11:02:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"she will always be there to answer any question you have","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU3Mzgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Lots of homework/quizzes/tests but information is clear and easy to understand. Lectures move at a fast pace but she is always there to answer questions. Reviews for every test; do them, they help A TON. Not too difficult to earn an A if you pay attention in class. Don't skip, you'll be confused in class if you do.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODQ2MTk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--TEST HEAVY--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
