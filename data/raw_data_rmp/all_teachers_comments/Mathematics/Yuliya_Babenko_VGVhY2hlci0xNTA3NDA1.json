She encourages students to ask questions, yet looks down on you and acts frustrated when you do so. She seems to not like the guys in her class for some reason. I always did homework, yet finished with a D in the class and had to retake calc 2. Quiz every other day, and only 5-8 minutes for 2 hard quiz questions...frustrating!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDEyNTA1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2302","date_posted":"2014-04-06 13:08:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Such a hard class. Had a quiz every other class based purely on the book, so homework was mandatory if you wanted to pass. She sometimes looks down on you if you have questions, but she's improving. Goes over homework at the start of every class, quiz or not. She offers a good bit of extra credit. Okay class, her attitude can be lacking though.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTk1ODE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CALCIIMWF","date_posted":"2013-11-03 17:36:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class is tough. About 50% dropped. The quizzes are really short (5-8 minutes for 2 questions) so you have to be on top of your homework. The tests are tough but not impossible. She hates questions in class, but if you go to her office hours she is very helpful. If you pass, you will be very good at calculus.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjQ4NTk1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2202","date_posted":"2013-03-05 07:36:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take her at your own risk!

Awesome grading system. I took her MWF, so we had a quiz everyday over material from the previous class date and have HW presentations.
