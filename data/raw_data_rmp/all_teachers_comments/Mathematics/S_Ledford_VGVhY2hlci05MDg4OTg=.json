Even though it was her first time teaching precalc, she was very knowledgable of the material and extremely helpful. She was very understanding and, overall, a very nice person. I strongly recommend her to everyone, even if you do not like math. I did not buy a book for this class, just MML.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDQwNTI5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1110","date_posted":"2012-05-08 21:47:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Teacher@!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjMzMTEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2012-04-18 16:25:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great teacher. take her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDczOTAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2012-03-19 09:29:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is an amazing teacher!

Quizzes were always an easy 100.. If you study for tests you will do well. Do homework, show up for class, make an effort and you'll get an A. Tests are pretty easy if you do your homework.
