Its math so of course its not interesting. He works lots of problems in class, but the tests have lots of word problems, so they are hard. Lots of extra credit, they can hurt you though if you do not use them. I can understand him  clearly and I'm American.

He is a jerk, and will mock you and make fun of you if you ask a question.  Gives plenty of extra credit, but it is a chore to go to his class.  He has a strong Indian accent.
