She just is not a good teacher, plain and simple. She spent class time letting students do problems on the board (which I thought was extremely elementary) and then she spend minimal time going over those problems herself..","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTA4NjIy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2011-12-06 21:16:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Even if you know pre calculus from high school, you still going to have problem doing her test?

Good thing I had taken precalc before I came to college. Her teaching is very strange. She doesnt teach you what is going to be on the tests. As well her tests dont come from my math lab either.
