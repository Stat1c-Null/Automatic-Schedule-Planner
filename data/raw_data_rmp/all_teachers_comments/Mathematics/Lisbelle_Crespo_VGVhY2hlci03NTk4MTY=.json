I think she has her own way to teach but she need to be flexible on her material. You are only right when you math is correct but for her you must follow her math. It is easy to make an A and pass  if you put little efforts.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MzgyMDU0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2240","date_posted":"2010-03-19 15:55:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is probably the best Math Professor I've had.

Is always in a rush to cut class early. Very willing to help in office hrs. Mult. choice test on 1111 class only. I will not take her again due to she teaches wayyy too fast.

I took College Algebra with her my first semester and achieved a perfect score. Given that the class is not hard at all, she was an effective teacher.
