She is the complete opposite of what your high school teachers try to terrify you of about college professors. She truly cares and enjoys seeing the sucess of her students individually and the class as a whole. She gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit and also allows you to meet with her personally if you have any questions. She takes things step by step and has no problem going back over things. Take her class!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Mjg0NjEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2010-05-21 18:02:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I LOVE DR.JOYNER.

She teaches quickly and can be hard to keep up with and also has pretty hard tests but she gives plenty of opportunities to improve your grade and is extremely helpful outside of class.

She gives you plenty of opportunities to improve your grade. Do Online HW helps at end of class, Quizzes are usually problems from the book or very close to them. She doesn't curve tests, and they are pretty hard. Review days offer chance at bonus pts. 8 SI sessions = bonus pts.

She was more than willing to answer any questions and explained things in a straightforward manner. She assigns homework from the book, which is not graded but is recommended for understanding. She gives partial credit on tests very generously.

She doesn't like leaving anyone behind though, and is always open to quesitons. Luckily, our class also had an SI. 4 tests, replace lowest with the final. Tests were fairly easy and the review covers material.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTE4Nzcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2009-10-25 14:12:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely awesome!

She always gives a review sheet, which is identical to the test. All tests are out of 104 pts. your basically given 4 pnts for error. Class uses Math XL,the book is for personal use(for extra practice). If ur grade is boarderline, then that is when attendence will matter. Lowest grade is replaced with the final grade.No extra credit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTU3MTkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
