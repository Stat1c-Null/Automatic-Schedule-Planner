You have to use ALEKS for this class and be careful because the due dates will sneak up on you. Dr. Kwan even helps you with questions you have during test. He is there to help you earn the A. Take if you are a incoming freshman.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTEyMzY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2020-07-30 15:33:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was an easy A, but there was a lot of work to do on ALEKS that you have to keep up with. He is a very nice man and the tests are plenty easy. He allows you to redo a test if you're not happy with your first grade. If you are already comfortable with math, class will be boring.

I am not good at teaching myself. Grade comes from four tests, the final, and HW that is done in ALEKS. He drops the lowest HW grade and allows you to retake one test (and when you do, he makes you fix it until you get it all right, so easy A).","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjIzODYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2020-05-04 09:17:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"4 test and final, with2 tests in class provided with study guides and allows a FULL PAGE cheat sheet. He allows you to retake the in class ones. Other tests and homework were online on ALEKS and its annoying but its bc of our math department. Gives many chances to make up late quizzes, tests, work.

Homework isn't really that hard either. The main problem I had in his class was that his lectures are absolutely terrible. His strong accent can be a problem and he constantly messes up examples and creates confusion. It's pretty safe to say he wasn't my professor, rather Youtube was.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDk2NzE4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2020-04-07 23:46:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Have to do ALEKS almost once a week.
