That quiz will hurt you the rest of the semester so study for that (review section) quiz. Review section is the hardest section.  Study it. has thick accent. MyMathlab is a pain to work with. If offered online tests DECLINE!!!!!! I repeat DONOT take tests online.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzIzMzYx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1111","date_posted":"2015-08-19 08:18:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"her lectures are crystal clear and easy to follow, Her explanation is thorough and understandable.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MTMzMTAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
