Do all the homework: it's extra credit, the only thing that saved my grade. Keep your tests and study them for the final, which is all taken straight from the tests.

She speaks in broken english and is hard to understand. The worst part on the tests are that you dont explain the answer enough. It can be a multiple choice answer and you get it right but she will count it wrong because you didnt explain.

Tests suck. Not because you have the answers wrong, but because she KILLS your grade by taking off 4 pts here and 3 pts there for random things.
