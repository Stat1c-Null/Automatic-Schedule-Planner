She wants us to succeed so if she sees that we are struggling, she offers extra credit. The book SUCKS and even she acknowledges that. The problems she gives on tests are easier than the book/online homework.

She gives out great notes & extra credit, which made this class a lot easier. Also, study groups are offered in case you don't fully understand the material. She does require a good amount of work that is hard to keep track of, but otherwise, this class is great for students who aren't great at math.

I'm not a fan of her teaching style. She just does examples the whole time and the problems we do are nothing like the ones on the test.
