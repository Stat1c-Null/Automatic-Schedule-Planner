She was so caring about every student and all her notes were so easy to follow. She lets you use notecards written with whatever you want on all tests and there is a lot of time to do the homework. She answers emails very quickly and wants all students to succeed. I would 100% recommend her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjkwMDM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2022-05-07 03:40:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"You can truly tell she cares about her student succeeding. I never went to class as she uploaded everything online, and she still knew my name and face. The quizzes are not like the homework (on ALEXS) a lot of the time, so that is a con of not going to class, but the tests are always exactly like the study guides. And you get a cheat sheet.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjcwOTE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2022-04-26 22:06:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy course overall but Professor Womack makes it even easier with clear teaching and expectations.

I was skeptical when I signed up for her as she didn't have any reviews, but she understands her students as she's a grad instructor. She is relatable, quick at answering emails, and helps you prepare for the class. I really think she is a great choice for a stats teacher. Take her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDYzNDEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2022-03-25 01:13:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is SUPER kind. The notes look like a lot but not that much really, it's more so just practice. notes easy to understand. I definitely recommend her class is you are taking statistics.
