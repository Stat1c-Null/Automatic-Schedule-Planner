He is accessible outside of class easily. Has a few tests and quizzes along with online homework. Gives good extra credit. I was struggling early on, but once you get the flow you'll be fine and I ended with a good A and aced final","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTU0MDA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2021-12-15 19:42:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's good at teaching other math material but just not educ math. He made us learn the base of 6 math, which is difficult if there aren't many resources. He never really gave us a straight answer to simple questions we asked. No study guide so you just had to take the chance. His test and material shown in class don't add up. I don't recommend him","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTQxNDc5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2021-09-23 17:01:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"From the first day of class until now, he has been nothing but a great professor.

He would be relating to the students and doing his best to help. He asked us to show work for test only but it ended up being helpful bc it really does help to get points back on a test. We even got some points back on quizzes too. Really nice prof. 5/5","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzQxMTc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2021-03-31 06:42:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had a rocky start, but once I figured out where I needed the most help he was there. Attend his office hours even if you don't feel as if you need them!! It's a great way to let him know you care about your grade ( from personal experience he's more inclined to help when he sees this). I wouldn't say the textbook was necessary, but it could help.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDkxODk3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1190","date_posted":"2020-12-16 03:33:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"There are weekly homework assignments, three tests, and six quizzes.

If you had a question, he would answer it. There is weekly homework, which is usual. 3 tests and a final exam with 6 quizzes. He will ALWAYS go back and check your work just in case the online grading messes up, which saved a lot of people in this class. Gave extra credit at the end too!

He tries to make the class funny with dad jokes, but his lectures can sometimes be all over the place. We weren't allowed to use technology so all notes are handwritten and he uses the whiteboard.

Homework every class, and 3 tests and the final.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzI4MjIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Beware of pop quizzes--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2019-04-18 19:24:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"He can be a little frustrating, but overall teaches pretty well and is easy to get along with.
