She is a decent teacher, my only knock is how slow she teaches, the class is absurdly easy and could and should be taught significantly faster. That being said tests and quizzes are in-person, but are absolute cake walks. Overall solid teacher, just did not enjoy her teaching style. Not my cup of tea, but could be yours.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjA4ODA1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2021-10-27 23:13:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very nice and will tell you everything important. She reminds about due dates and take attendance randomly. Would definitely take again if I was able to. She explains things multiple ways if need be.

Only complaint is shes a little soft spoken (not too bad tho), the way she explains stuff sometimes is a lil confusing, and ALEKS (but I think all math teachers have to use this) She really cares abt her students, and puts out study guides very similar to tests, and reminds us about due dates. Its a bit of a tough course so study","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTYxNzM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

She takes attendance for a grade but the class is actually kind of fun. She teaches really well and her lecture slides are available any time on D2L. She is easy to work with and explains topics in multiple ways to give everyone the chance to understand. I'd take her again if I could.
