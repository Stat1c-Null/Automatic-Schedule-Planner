Our course was a mastering course, so we got to retake our tests/homework as many times as necessary and would give feedback on topics. Fantastic and deserving of all the praise she has received.

Her grading system rewards students who learn the material since you can retake previous assignments. Also, she gives tons of feedback on past assignments and she is great at answering questions.

Has a deep understanding and passion for the topic. She is merciful. Allows you to reassess any exam topic on which you perform poorly. This can completely recover bad grades.

You are able to reassess the tests as many times as you want. You can only redo one question at a time though. She was a great professor who really cared.

I did the whole class online with no problem. The homework is not graded and is only used as a benefit for you. The tests weren't that bad and you were able to make corrections or reassess if needed.
