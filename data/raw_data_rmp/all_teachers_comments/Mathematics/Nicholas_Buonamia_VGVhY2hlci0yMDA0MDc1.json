He obviously knows the subject though, and he's very smart, but I don't think teaching is his strength. I really struggled to get an A in this class, one of the hardest things I've ever done.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MzY5NjQw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Tests are tough--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECON2300","date_posted":"2017-12-04 08:32:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was an easy A for me. His quizzes were straight forward and the answers were easily accessible. I would take him again. You just need to pay attention to when he opens and closes quizzes.

Statistics is already hard, but he makes it even more difficult.

He is a nice guy, and very capable statistician, but an awful professor. He can't read the class. He lectures like he's reading computer code. Students regularly are confused and he thinks 2 minutes after class is enough. He's an awful professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDQ5NTc0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
