He was so helpful. He always stayed after class to clear up anything I didn't understand. He provides the formulas, so no worries about memorizing them. Plus he doesn't require that $100+ calulator. He even gives you awesome reviews exactly like his tests.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTg2NTg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2016-02-02 01:08:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Chang is the best for this course.

All you  need know going in how add, subtract, multiply, divide, and PEMDAS, simple arithmetic. He makes it really easy because he gives you the formula AND you don't have to calculate everything.
