Her syllabus does not specify how she grades and she adds things to it without warning or explanation.  The book is not as useful as the PowerPoint presentations, however; you won't receive them until after the chapter homework is completed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDQ5MDUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2013-12-05 21:20:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"She isn't a horrible teacher, but she is really slow with emails. You HAVE to do the homework before class otherwise you'll wind up being confused. Her exams were lengthy but if you did the homework and reviewed you'll be fine.

If you need to learn statistics in depth, maybe not. She is sweet and patient, but often makes mistakes that end up confusing the class. If you read the chapters and do quizzes before class(it was apparent from the questions asked in class that a lot of students DID NOT), you'll do fine.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMzA0NTYw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2012-12-11 11:49:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"PLEASE! Don't take her, whoever you are. I got A in her class, but I didn't know anything about statistic. The worst professor I ever met.

You basically had to teach yourself in order to turn in homework and quizes, then she would teach the material once it was turned in. Randomly decides when homework and quizes are due. And was never really clear when explaining the chapters.

First of all, she is still a student herself.  She is stressed with her own classes and assigns work around her schedule.  She will assign homework 3 days before it's due and it's possible she will change the due date.  If you like having assignments due on Friday or Saturday, go ahead.
