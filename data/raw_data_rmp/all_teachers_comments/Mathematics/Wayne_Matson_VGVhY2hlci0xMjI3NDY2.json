He may not make a lot of sense the first time he explains something, but its a REALLYYY easy class to get an A in. He grades tests starting over 100 points so even if you get some wrong you can still get a 100. He also drops your lowest test score. He's nice too. Really really easy to get a good grade!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzUzNTg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2010-01-06 17:14:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great teacher. He is so funny. I absolutely loved his class. I found it frustrating at first, but then once I understood his sense of humor, it made it tons easier. He lets you make a cheat sheet for every test, and retake a test, AND drop the lowest one.

ALL HE TALKS ABOUT IS SPACE AND PHYSICS. He does not teach the material at all. He also   calls a student to board each to write all the problems on the board and do the work to them.

Easiest Math class I have ever taken in my life. He's kinda funny and extremely easy. He lets your drop your lowest test grade. You can retake any test you want to get a better grade.

Obviously bitter about having to teach such a low lvl class & can at times make bright students feel dumb. Gives 5 exams, allows 1 to be retaken & drops lowest test grade. Final is cumulative.
