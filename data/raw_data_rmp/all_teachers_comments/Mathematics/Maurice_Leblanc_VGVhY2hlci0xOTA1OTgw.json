Loves math and his job, and you can really feel his enthusiasm through his lectures. Extremely fair grader, lectures well and does a great job making sure everybody understands the material.

His lectures will hold your attention, even through the boring stuff.  He handles his students(especially disruptive ones) with class and respect.

He doesn't assign much homework(3 problems/week), so you're on your own to do extra problems to learn the material.  Always around for office hours, and if you show up he'll work even the assigned problems with you.  Tests are hard, but he gives lots of partial credit.
