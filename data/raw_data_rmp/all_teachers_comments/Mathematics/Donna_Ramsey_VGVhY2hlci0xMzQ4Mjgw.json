Laid back and extremely helpful. Holds help sessions on Fridays if you are struggling. Attendance not mandatory and HW was not graded, but I would recommend showing up and doing the HW to earn a good grade.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzMwMDM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MH1111","date_posted":"2009-12-28 15:13:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"No Comments","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NjQ5ODQz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2009-12-11 23:31:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"She assigns things that go along with the test, and answers all questions.

She knows her stuff, but she does not know how to teach her stuff. However she is VERY nice and easy going, and if you ask her for help she will be glad to give it. She holds an extra help session on Fridays, which basically serve as an extra class period. Suggestions: Go to class, do your homework!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mzg3NTg5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
