She's young, but she's the polar opposite of those young moody high school teachers who haven't yet matured. She makes the class relaxed and lighthearted. Her bonus questions on tests are usually &quot;What is your favorite ice cream flavor?&quot; or &quot;What are your Thanksgiving plans?&quot; She let us donate money to charity as bonus pts.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTQyOTM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2332","date_posted":"2018-02-23 16:09:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Literally attend her class and study the in-class notes and you're guaranteed an A.
