Prof. Orsini made it easy, not because his class was slack-off easy (it's not), but because he made statistics easy to understand and work with. Suddenly this chore of a subject became my favorite class, thanks to him. Take his class, trust me.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDQ2NTM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2013-07-26 09:51:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Orsini is the best professor I've had yet! He is so helpful and always available. There are 3 tests and a final, but your final replaces your lowest test grade. He is the nicest professor I have ever been around and treats students with respect. I ended up with an A. I HIGHLY reccomend him!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTk5Mjkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2013-07-25 19:02:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Excellent professor! Took him for the 8 week summer session of STAT 1107 and got an A! He is very nice and helpful and even welcomes questions. He makes himself available for students when they need him. He even worked with me over an emergency medical issue I had that caused me to miss the final exam. Great professor! I recommend him 100%!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTk3Nzc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2012-07-30 16:38:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"THE BEST PROFESSOR I'VE HAD YET!  He is clear about his expectations, extremely helpful, and tests are pretty easy. Don't worry about reading the book because he doesn't really teach from it. Attend all classes because he tells you things that will be on tests especially for the final. I would highly recommend this professor!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTI5NTEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2012-07-16 16:54:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Orsini is an excellent teacher.
