Every time she tried to explain something, it was as if she had never explained it before.  Tests were fair, but I mostly used the book to study because Dr. Garner only served to confuse me more...that is, when I could get her to understand what I was asking.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NjUyMTUx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH4495","date_posted":"2007-12-06 13:46:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing teacher! She wants you to get the material before the end of the semester, so if you fail a test, she has retakes (different test but same stuff) on a Friday afternoon. I've had her for 2 classes and I would take her again if I could. She doesn't want to spoon feed you, but she'll guide you and tell you the answer if you just don't get it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNzYxMTAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3495","date_posted":"2007-05-20 01:11:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. G is a great teacher.  She really cares about you learning and getting the most out of the class.  Sure there is a lot of work and she may not answer your questions directly, but that's because she wants you to figure it out.  She will nudge you into the right direction, and she is always available outside of class to help.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMTkwMzE2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH4495","date_posted":"2006-12-26 14:14:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"She can be nice but can be very rude too.  She never really seems to answer the question you ask; she has a round about way of answering it.  She gives a lot of work for you to do and doesn't seem to like to give help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNjgzOTI4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
