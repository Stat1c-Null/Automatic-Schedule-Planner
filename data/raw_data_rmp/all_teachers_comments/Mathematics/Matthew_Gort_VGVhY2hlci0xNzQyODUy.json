He writes problems on the board, gives you the answer with little to no explanation as to why. If you ask he writes it again. He doesn't break it down for you at all. I met up with a tutor and understood more in an hour than I did his class the entire semester.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjg2NDc4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2013-01-09 12:54:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's nice and funny. Doesn't really know how to teach. If you ask for help he will work with you for hours but he'll still play his video games.
