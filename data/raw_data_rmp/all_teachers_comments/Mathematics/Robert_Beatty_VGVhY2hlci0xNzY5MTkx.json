B/c of this I actually saw the bigger picture & understand trig. He grades TOO fairly anyway, so you can still make an excellent grade even if its difficult. PS trig is a difficult class no matter who you take.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzA2MDg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TRIG1112","date_posted":"2013-04-14 22:58:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a super nice guy and a really thoughtful and thorough teacher. you can receive bonus points for catching his mistakes. if you simply pay attention you will learn a lot and pass with an A!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTM0OTE0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1112","date_posted":"2013-04-11 15:06:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is fair. If you ask questions he will answer, come to class. He notices when people are here and will give you bonus points. He wants you to pass. He doesn't give a lot of homework. His second test, no one passes, so he gave us our tests back to take home and redo. We always got out of class early.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTIwMTMx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATHQASD","date_posted":"2012-12-02 21:30:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very hard class and doesnt explain anything. if you are not good at math then do NOT take this class, its his first year teaching and you can definitely tell. he thinks that everyone has the same IQ as him. he is understanding about your grades and will usually reopen quizzes for you to take again. quizzes, homework are online thats only advantage.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTMyOTc0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2012-11-19 12:37:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Because this was his first year being an actual professor he didn't really make an impression on me. He was very unclear and not helpful. He didn't respond to emails. He isn't great at teaching either. AVOID THIS CALSS! Also when I signed up for math the class' professor said Nancy Burney, but nope he must be working with her.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODYxODU2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
