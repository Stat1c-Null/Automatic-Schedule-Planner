Every email was responded to within 24 hours with solutions and follow ups. The only downside is that the tests have more weight than most classes but she allows 2 attempts and the use of a notecard Front and Back. Definitely would recomend her!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTMxODQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Math1111","date_posted":"2025-07-27 04:35:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Okay so I have Ms. Kang for Pre calculus, the accent is pretty hard to understand especially while learning math. If you get this professor then just actually put in the work and study, don't just use ai for it, you will be fine!!! \nShe does allow a 3x5 notebook card front and back for tests (except final) so that was a huge help.

Random attendance checks, and ALEKS (online practice) as homework every unit, which can be long and boring. No one talks, even though she tries to foster a communicative environment.
