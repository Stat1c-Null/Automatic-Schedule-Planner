I called her at the time she told me to and she didn't answer. Responded a week later and rescheduled. When I did get her on the phone she was driving. By that point it was too late for her to even help me. Refused to bump me from a 69.47 to a 70.

She is really bad at responding to emails and she is really rude. Plus, I'm 99% sure that she pretended to not get emails after I had to call the department chair to get her to respond (not saying that's what happened, but it was sketchy). Overall she is a bad person.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTc2NDIw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2016-11-16 19:59:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly, I would be okay with all of the work if she would realize that this is a lower level course. Her grading criteria is ridiculous and even if you give her what she wants she always has something to comment on. Seriously, this is not a physics class lady, we're getting credit for basically having a pulse so calm down with the assignments.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjA1MTU2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2016-05-11 20:22:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was super easy. Would totally recommend taking Wellness online. However, it is the professor I have an issue with. She wasn't understanding whatsoever with any kind of issue that conflicted with turning something in. Made in A in every module, except one where she would NOT help me with solving an issue. Not very personable, kind of rude.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTQ2MTA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2016-01-07 20:31:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Almost all of the work is done online with an awful and confusing website but Burleson is a pretty entertaining prof who rarely ever held class which is great if you're into that.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODk5MjU4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"81192","date_posted":"2015-09-10 02:29:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"It's mainly an online class and she hates the software as much as the students.
