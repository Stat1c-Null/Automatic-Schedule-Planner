I've made A's and B's in all my other math classes and I'm struggling just to get a C in Miller's class.  She takes off points for the littlest things on tests and if you don't work out a problem her way, expect to get points off.

Two tests & a final. Homework but not too much, do it because she'll check it every once in a while. Gave a free 100 to people who did the hw. Ask for help, she's very willing. 2 projects, easy 100 if you turn it in early for her to check. Wouldn't take again, confusing.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzOTc4ODEw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2008","date_posted":"2014-11-07 10:04:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am taking this class right now and it is by far the best Math course I have taken at University.

She is not clear during her lectures. I often felt that she was incapable of understanding her students and teaching them. There is also no structure in her class, which makes the tests really hard to complete!

For someone who struggles in math, TAKE ANYONE but her. If you're good with definitions (that really don't help) and Venn diagrams for HER learning style, then take her! She is a complainer and flat out shouldn't be a teacher.
