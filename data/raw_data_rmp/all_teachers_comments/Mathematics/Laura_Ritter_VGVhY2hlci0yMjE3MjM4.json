Gives partial credit on tests, and many opportunities for extra credit. Also not just tests, there were group assignments, and in class quizzes. No mandatory homework. I am taking him again next semester, definitely worth it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Nzc2MDk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
