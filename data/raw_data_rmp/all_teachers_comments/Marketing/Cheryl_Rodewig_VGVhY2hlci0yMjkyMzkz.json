The most unprofessional, incredibly rude, and disorganized professor I have ever encountered. The class is a writing class. She grades are based on her feelings. Rodewig contradicts herself and is dishonest. I didn't learn anything.

She was a straight forward, helpful professor. The assignments were easy to understand and any time I had questions she would answer right away. I recommend her as an online class, the class was easy to follow through the semester as well. She offers so so so SO much extra credit.
