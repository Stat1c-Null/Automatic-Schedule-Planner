She pretty much requires the same amount of work as a 16-week class and is an ridiculously tough grader. She does not seem to care about her students success unless you complete the assignments SUPER in-depth. She requires way too much overall.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTQ1MDY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4820","date_posted":"2022-06-14 08:49:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lots of work (disc. posts and quizzes weekly, midterm, final, some papers, and a group project).Strict grading, however, if you put work into the class, it is an easy A. Assignments seem like a lot at first, but they help you understand the concepts better. Attendance is mandatory, but it only accounts for 2% of your grade. Also very understanding.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NDYyNDg3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4820","date_posted":"2022-05-08 21:59:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Martha was one of the worst professors I have had while attending KSU. Students could really tell how unprepared each lecture was. From a student paying for the class felt like I missed out due to her not ever being prepared or debriefed by students on all the assignments she forgot was assigned during the week (which she herself assigned).
