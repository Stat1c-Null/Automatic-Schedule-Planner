You will NOT get an A in group presentation or paper. His exams are confusing and tricky. 3 exams, 1 group presentation, 1 group report. Attendance is optional. Take a dif professor if you want an A in this class. I ended with a C.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxODk2NDgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
