Gave everyone in my group but me an A when I did just as much as anyone else in the group. I was bullied by my group, they wanted me to fail from the beginning and when I let her know this she didn't care. I asked why she gave me a C and she couldn't tell me the specific reason. She is pro cyber bullying.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Nzg1MjQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MKTG4820","date_posted":"2021-01-26 19:25:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Im sure if I met her she would be a fine person. However as a professor she is a bit condescending &amp; calls on people regardless if you know the answer. If you miss a class, she will take points directly off your final grade. Also even 1 minute late she ridicules you in front of the class saying this is America / you are creating a disturbance.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MzE3OTI2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?
