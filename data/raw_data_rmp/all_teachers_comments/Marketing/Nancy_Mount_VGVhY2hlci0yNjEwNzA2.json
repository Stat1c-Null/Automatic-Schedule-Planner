Prof. Mount is a tough grader (and gives no details) and this class had 2 field experience reports (event and interview) that accounted for most of your grade. TONS OF WORK DUE! I would NOT take her again, take Tyra Burton if you get the option!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTQwMTY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MKT380","date_posted":"2020-07-20 17:09:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Beware! Do not take her! She grades so harshly with absolutely no feedback. All tests and quizzes are open answer, and she will give you a C on every test and quiz. Grades discussions and papers extremely harsh as well. She didn't put any grades in until the last week of class, and didn't answer any emails throughout the semester.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTE5OTA4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
