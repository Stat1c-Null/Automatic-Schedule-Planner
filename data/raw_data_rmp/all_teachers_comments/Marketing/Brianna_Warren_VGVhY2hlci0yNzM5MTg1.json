The group project was 50% of the grade, and the directions for the project were terrible and confusing. The directions didn't line up with what the professor said she wanted in the assignment submission feedback. She contradicted what her ow directions said. Tough grader too.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzI0NzUz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4880","date_posted":"2024-01-17 17:26:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Warren is incredible and so kind!

I would recommend Professor Warren a million times over. With an already stressful semester due to graduation, she made this class enjoyable which really made the content more digestible. She is always available if you need help or have questions.

Definitely my favorite teacher at KSU. She makes the class interesting . the quizzes and test are open note and not hard.

She was very responsive & lets you text her which is so much easier and faster. She is a very fair grader and was genuinely so nice. She even let you opt out of the final if you were content with your grade. 10/10 professor and 2/10 difficulty level. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjM3NDMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Inspirational","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4880","date_posted":"2021-12-07 21:30:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor!! I enjoyed learning about this class especially because hospitality and tourism industry is the field I want to pursue. 3 discussion posts, 4 experimental exercise papers, quizzes are not hard. All of the information can be found in the book. And one project that you can work on throughout the semester. Only exam is the final","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDA0NzUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
