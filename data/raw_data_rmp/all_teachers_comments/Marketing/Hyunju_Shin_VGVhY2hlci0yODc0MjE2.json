In person, online, AND lockdown browser tests are over the top and unnecessary. Large group project and paper you work on throughout the semester and she is a harsh grader. If you are hoping to get an easy A with this entry level class think again. Pick someone else.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTk1OTQ0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4100","date_posted":"2024-07-19 22:42:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"The worst professor I have had at KSU so far.

She is caring, provides good feedback and is engaging with the class, and gives clear guidelines on what is due. She is willing to adapt to student needs, although her tests are a bit more difficult and requires you to go to class (video heavy).","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDIyOTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4990","date_posted":"2023-11-18 14:57:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice & definitely cares about her students. Pretty basic KSU class. Smartbooks for hw, but they're only due right before each test. There is a semester group project and presentation. She grades attendance, but only a few times and it's random. Tests are online with lock down browser and webcam. Easily accessible outside of class.

The first half of the semester is based on lectures and quizzes. Two total group projects and presentations. One is a simulation for the second half of the semester. Her grading is subjective and doesn't make a lot of sense.

She explains things fully and really likes to get interaction from the class to ensure student comprehension. She utilizes quizzes in class that you have to be in attendance for so attendance is very important which some students may not like.
