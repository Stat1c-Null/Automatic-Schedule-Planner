He's highly educated and well-versed in his field. He's the most effective and knowledgeable professor I've ever had. TAKE THE AI CLASS! It's cutting edge and you WILL have an advantage in the real world. I wish I could take his classes post-graduation. Guest speakers are renowned and genius.

There is a simulation that is a large portion of your grade and is difficult to perform well on. Overall, he's not a bad professor and it's not difficult to pass, but there's just too much work for what the class entails.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDY2Mjc2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Hilarious--Graded by few things","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4650","date_posted":"2022-12-02 21:04:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very hands-on to ensure we would be 'job-ready'. The HubSpot/Google certificates were great. A caring Professor who is always available/willing to help his students. The Simulation gives a dashboard of strengths/weaknesses, used it to answer the 'what are my weaknesses' question during a job interview. Definitely recommend this Course/Professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTUwNjgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4650","date_posted":"2022-11-16 18:39:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I did not learn anything in this class because he doesn't like to teach. He is not willing to help or answer any questions you have. You have to read the textbook and teach yourself. This elective has more busy work than your actual classes. He is the worst professor I've had at KSU, and I would advise anyone to not take this class.

You have to do quizzes, HubSpot certifications and work on a simulation each week. The simulation you do isn't even focused on advertising and he will give you advice that is wrong. He doesn't teach the material that is on the quizzes, and you get 10 minutes to answer 10 questions. Horrible class.

If you ask him questions you will get a rude response and he does not care if you do bad in his class. He is rude and likes to watch students suffer.

Class was based on a simulation that is not even mainly about advertising. He only taught for first 3 weeks then did the simulation the rest of semester. He didn't even know how the simulation worked (he led my group wrong a lot). Quiz every week(worth 48%) that's 10min-10questions and difficult. I learned nothing from him.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzYxNTk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework--Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4650","date_posted":"2021-12-08 15:43:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is an EASY A! No tests, only quizzes with no camera just lockdown. Also have a HubSpot certificate due every week, but those are easy and take an hour at most to complete. It is an interesting elective, that I highly recommend if you want to help your GPA!
