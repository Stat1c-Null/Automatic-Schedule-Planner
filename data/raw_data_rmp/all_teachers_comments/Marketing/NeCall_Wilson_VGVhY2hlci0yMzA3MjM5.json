She was unresponsive 90% of the semester and didnt grade anything until the last week of class. Its doable but its not worth the stress of not knowing your grade until very last minute.

She's really caring and wants you to do good. Practically sat there all semester and no tests unless you miss more than three classes. This class is great if you need a quick GPA booster.

Professor Wilson is so caring and gives a lot of extra credit throughout the semester. If you miss more than 3 classes you have to take the final but you will seriously want to go to class. Such an amazing class and teacher.

She's a really good person and sweet and works with the class, you just have to voice out your opinion. 2. She's the worst professor ever, as far as being a teacher. She does not teach. I never for once opened my book bag. 3. That is why there are no exams in her class except a final when you skip more than 3 classes 4.

She is smart but does not know how to stick to her own deadlines. We have had more guest speakers than engaging class periods. She gets mad when you question her, even if it is just to clarify her ever changing directions. No tests and you don't have to take the final if you miss 3 or less classes which is cool.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjg5OTM3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":7,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MKT3100","date_posted":"2018-05-09 17:52:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"I enjoyed her class! The class mainly consist of group projects back to back but it wasn't too bad. Attendance was MANDATORY. miss more than 2 classes than you will have to take the final. She had us get up &amp; present something every class but it helped at the end to get comfortable with presentation skills.

Although there was some struggle keeping up with the schedule on the syllabus, Prof. Wilson altered the syllabus to fit what we were able to accomplish. I'd consider her a very fair prof. and with more experience her classes should become more productive.

This was her first semester teaching and it shows. Schedule/syllabus changes every day. If you email her, she emails you that she doesn't have time get to your email and that you should talk to her after class. Instructions are unclear. If you miss more than once class, the final is mandatory.
