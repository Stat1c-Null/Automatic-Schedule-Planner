She has been very successful at such a young age, and truly cares about the success of her students. She tries to make the class more applicable to life, rather than just regurgitating text book information. You can miss up to 3 classes without penalty, which I found was plenty. VERY easy, just put in effort","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODcxOTgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3150","date_posted":"2018-03-27 13:05:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love professor Jackson and the semesters not even over with! You can tell that she loves helping young adults and doesn't always make her lectures about course materials. Sometimes she lectures about what you actually need to succeed for life after college which was really helpful.
