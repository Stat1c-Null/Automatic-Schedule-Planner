The coursework itself isn't too hard, but the final project was 100 survey responses + you had to analyze it and write a paper. I had awful groupmates, but thankfully the professor was serious about participation and I still got a good grade for my portion. Lectures + notes are very helpful!

Attendance is mandatory. Overall, Dr. Fennell is very caring and wants you to succeed.

Very intelligent, willing to help kindly. Tests are kind of tough, probably need study guides is only complaint. One semester-long group project, one group paper. Takes time to learn about all of his students.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mjc5MTY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
