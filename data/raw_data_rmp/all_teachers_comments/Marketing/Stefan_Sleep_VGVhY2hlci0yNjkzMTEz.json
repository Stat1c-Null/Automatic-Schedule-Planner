He uses humor and personal stories to help teach you all the basics of the sales world. His in-class activities are fun and make you want to participate. The exams aren't too bad, the final is 3 short essay questions about a book we had to read during the semester.

Don't buy the textbook, he gives you everything you'll need for the class in person. Tests are simple and straightforward; the final is based on a book that you'll need to read but it's not bad. There are many selling activities; I wish the class was a bit more focused more on marketing but it wasn't bad.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDEyOTg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3140","date_posted":"2022-07-21 04:01:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very funny and great at teaching sales","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTMyOTg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3410","date_posted":"2022-04-29 17:10:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the best professors Ive ever had","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTkzNjcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3410","date_posted":"2021-12-14 21:20:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"There were a lot of role-play/presentation-type assignments and those were pretty annoying &amp; challenging, however other than that the class was great and I would definitely recommend taking Stefan Sleep. It'd be nice if the class was geared a little more towards marketing majors or included options for introverts, but in general, it was good.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTIzNDg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3410","date_posted":"2021-12-11 01:54:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gives exam review guides and don't buy the textbook (you won't need it).
