You have an online quiz about once a week, he assigns a discussion post about every two weeks, 2 tests online and he assigns a group project case study. It was a decent amount of work however easy to do! If I could take him again I would!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTUzMDIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
