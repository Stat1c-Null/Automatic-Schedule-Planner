Like in the beginning of the semester he sent us 6 different syllabus and they were each equally as confusing and terribly formatted as the next. I think he teaches multiple classes because the titles were weird.

You can get an A, but you'll go through hell to get it. His test questions are often very deceiving to trick you into choosing the *almost* right answer, but it's not quite right.
