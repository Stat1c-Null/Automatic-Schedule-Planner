He always made sure we understood the material, often checking if his examples made sense or if we preferred ones from industries we related to. Super thoughtful & engaging, made the class genuinely enjoyable! By far one of the nicest teachers I've had & I would absolutely recommend anyone take him!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzUzNDkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3100","date_posted":"2025-05-08 01:54:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Iyer is a great teacher. He has a great personality, though he seems reserved at first. He wants to have conversations with you not just talk at you. Good sense of humor. Easy grader. Took him for MGT 7010 for MBA. I think there were 3-4 group projects (including two cases).

Make sure to get started on the group project early, it's not super hard, but there's a lot to do. Dr. Iyer was very responsive to emails and encouraged students to send him their projects to receive feedback before turning it in. Overall, I would take him again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mjc1ODAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
