He is an excellent professor; you will learn a great deal that will be useful in the real world. Throughout the semester, there is a group project that simulates a real business, hubspot and google certificates, and simple weekly quizzes. Easy A. Make an effort. Not amndatory but worth going to class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NjUzNjA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4500","date_posted":"2023-04-18 15:26:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"He has a long track history dealing with marketing and that makes for great feedback on assignments. There is a lot of work to be done with this class, but it is relatively easy and there is ample time to do the assignments. Lots of certs with hubspot and google analytics, but nothing too strenuous.
