She has real world experience and is able to translate that into her teaching very well. She actually cares about your future and shows it. If you actually go to class, pay attention, and do your work you will get a good grade in her class. Definitely take her if possible.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjYxMjY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKGT8050","date_posted":"2021-01-29 00:19:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great proffesor with real life experience in the field of marketing.

A large percent of your grade is based off a group project, which involves sponsoring an actual sports team. It is very difficult to plan and coordinate.
