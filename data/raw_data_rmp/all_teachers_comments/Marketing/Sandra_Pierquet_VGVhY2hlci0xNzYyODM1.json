She is very unorganized and will throw all work on you at the very end of the semester. The entire class was surrounded around a Brain Lab activity verses learning how to advertise. Oh yea, she is always right...you're always wrong!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjA2ODIz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3100","date_posted":"2014-04-01 09:39:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"She expects alot from her students-expecting them to be adults and do the work that is assigned. Considering the volume of material to be covered she did a great job. I enjoyed the current examples she had in class. If you talk to her, you understand she does care and will help you succeed in class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTczNDQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4870","date_posted":"2013-12-03 20:15:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am a good student and have been at two different colleges. She is by far the worst teacher I have ever taken. What she has to say in class does not even relate to the tests. She doesn't know how to manage people or communicate topics. Not a very tough class, but she makes you not want to attend. I would not advise taking her class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDI1NDcz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4650","date_posted":"2013-05-09 18:30:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"A ton of busy work. The group project was ridiculous, but I heard that if you schedule an appointment with her for help she will explain everything you need to do. Make friends with her and participate and you should do fine. You have 5 minutes to take a 10MC quiz every week online and she started doing open book tests towards the end.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzIxODcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4870","date_posted":"2013-05-07 15:12:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was literally the worst teacher I have ever had. She didn't teach us anything and just gave us busy work. The group project was all semester and we worked really hard on it and barely got a C. The tests were ridiculously hard especially since she didn't teach us anything. Also, she was extremely unorganized.

She grades all assignments really hard and it's impossible to keep up w/ her system and ignorance on D2L. Worst of all, she's rude and runs her class like a drill sergeant. If you take her class prepare to drown in busy work.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjM5NDI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4820","date_posted":"2012-11-07 13:34:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor was one of the worst I ever had. Expectations were not clear. Class time is devoted to reading articles out of the Wall Street Journal. The test were impossible, 1st test, literally the entire class failed. Test are administered in class on Vista and are extremely difficult. Group project is also intense.Save your money!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzkyMTc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
