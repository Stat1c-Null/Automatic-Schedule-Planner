Saying she is amazing is an understatement.  She is extremely knowledgable and you will learn things that are actually useful in real life! I would take her class any day and every day.  I wish more professors were like her because I would actually enjoy going to those classes then.

She really intellectual but knows how to simplify it just enough for you to understand. Gives great feedback and  outlines test material.

Very helpful and puts up videos of her teaching to help students understand better. The subject is difficult to learn but she makes it more interesting. I would suggest taking her for this course. There are 4 tests and online quizzes. Also a team project that is easy, and paired assignments which are relatively easy as well.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTA0NTk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON4520","date_posted":"2013-12-12 08:39:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tyra has been one of my favorite professors at Kennesaw in the last 4 years. I have never met someone who loved what they do as much as she does. There is no tricking when it comes to tests (which are all essay) but she makes it clear what she wants.

Overall a fun class with interesting lectures and very minimal workload.
