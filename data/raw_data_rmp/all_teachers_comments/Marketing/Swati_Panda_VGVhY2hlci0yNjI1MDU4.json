The mid-term and end-term (final) take a hot minute to do and she does grade them a bit more 'strictly' than other coursework so make sure you start them at the beginning of the module and don't procrastinate.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDA5NzE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3100","date_posted":"2021-05-13 21:01:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easiest A ever.
