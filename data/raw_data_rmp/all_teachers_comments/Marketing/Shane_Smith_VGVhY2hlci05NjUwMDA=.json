I'm a straight-A student and this class is testing me. Freshman seminar in general has way too many assignments and projects, but her class is ridiculous. Don't take this professor.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODEzNDI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4870","date_posted":"2012-07-30 00:16:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shane is a cool guy. He remembers the strategies to \"get by\" in college, and makes it more difficult. During the summer semester, we had quizzes almost every day to ensure students read the chapter prior to the lecture. No final, just a business proposal at the end of the semester. But this was his last class at KSU. He is moving to a new school...","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTI3OTEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4490","date_posted":"2009-12-17 20:41:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"I also took him for a Decembermester class and he made the experience SO SIMPLE AND ENJOYABLE! He's definitely one of THE BEST professors I've ever had in my college career. You can tell that he's passionate about what he's teaching and that really makes a difference. I would highly recommend taking him, because he is just absolutely fantastic!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTg4NzQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4490","date_posted":"2009-12-16 21:34:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome Professor!!

He always connects class with current events and encourages class participation.  There are no tests and the quizzes are very simple.  the class focuses big time on the project but this one is enjoyable and allows you to use your skills. I def recommend him.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTM2Mjcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MRKT4870","date_posted":"2008-02-25 13:15:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"He helps you through the class.

I took his B2B class, which he apparantly will no longer be teaching, and got a B with little effort.  He gives random quizzes every now and then, along with about 12 HW assignments and 4 Tests.  I heard his Sports Marketing class is very interesting, so take him if you can.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzODQxMTA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG4870","date_posted":"2007-03-12 12:24:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good fun Professor!  Interested in getting class involved and concerned with our understanding of the material.  Fair and straightforward with what he wants you to know.  I am taking his sports marketing course and unlike other professors we don't play stupid games or assigned stupid projects.
