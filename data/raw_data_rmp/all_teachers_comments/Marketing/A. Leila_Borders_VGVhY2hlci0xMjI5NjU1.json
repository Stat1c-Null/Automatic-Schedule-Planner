A good amount of busy work, in a pandemic, and the syllabus and the d2l instructions rarely matched. The instructions were VERY vague and then they give specific feedback for things they never stated in the instructions. Rude replies when asked for grade corrections.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njc4MTQx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MKTG4350","date_posted":"2021-04-24 13:33:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is an easy A, but your going to be doing homework weekly and at times more than one assignment.

At the beginning of the semester, she makes it clear her expectations of you. Lectures are more like discussions, so come to class I would skim the textbook and do the extra work she assigns (even though it is not graded) because it will help you tremendously on the final.
