Did not really explain concepts and let students answer other students questions. One time said Coca-Cola was a monopoly.

Simple information such as test dates and project due dates are near impossible to find due to her inability to use D2L. Lectures are absolutely pointless because the tests come 100% from the textbook. On top of this, she can be rude and disrespectful for no reason.

There is no point in emailing, she won't respond. The group project is easy but annoying. She is unbelievably confusing and isn't even remotely clear with grading.
