He has in-class assignments, out of class assignments, and a final project. His assignments work around your schedule and are seriously so EASY! The lectures are so interesting, it will make you want to come to class. Attendance is not mandatory and if you miss, he is so understanding. Take him!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTY1ODY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
