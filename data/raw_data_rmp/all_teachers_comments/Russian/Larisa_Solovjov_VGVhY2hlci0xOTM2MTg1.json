The Russian language has a lot of rules and factors to consider so it'd be in your best interest to attend class and take notes. She does give a good bit of homework but it is necessary in order to grasp all of the concepts. I will say that she is very generous in her grading if you show some effort.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njk5MTQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"RUS1002","date_posted":"2015-06-30 17:27:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Russian is difficult, but Professor Solovjov is there for you.

If you expect to just show up for lectures and pass, you probably won't. You have to learn a new alphabet and an entirely different language structure.

Keeps telling us that she knows we're just learning, but the assignments don't make it seem that way. Gives you 20 minutes to take a 3-4 page test WITH WRITING (and this was just the first test). I know Russian is hard, but she moves way too fast. Had to drop the course. Wouldn't recommend her.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzQ4Nzc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
