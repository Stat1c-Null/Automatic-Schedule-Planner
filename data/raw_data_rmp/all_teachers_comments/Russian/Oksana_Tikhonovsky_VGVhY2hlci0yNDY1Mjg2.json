I'm cros-reg at KSU for this class & I'm so glad I chose it over Tech or UGA. She cares so much & is very patient with you since she knows this is a hard language. Put in the work to watch the short lectures, show up to class & do the homework & you will be fine. The tutor is also a huge help & a native speaker!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDU1Mzk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"RUSS1001","date_posted":"2020-10-28 17:42:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is awesome, the lectures are not really mandatory, but participation is important. She walks you through everything you're having trouble with and you learn a lot! Russian is hard but she is very caring and easily accessible.

With that being said, OT is a wonderful professor and will push you hard during class so you can become a proficient speaker. I had her for two semesters and learned a lot.

Your grade is determined by what you do to be successful in the class. Tests were tough but there were study guides. 1-2 assignments due each week. Lots of in class participation which was practical for a foreign language class. Would def. recommend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODA0ODQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Lots of homework--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
