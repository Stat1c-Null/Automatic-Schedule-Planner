Confusing instructions, slow communication, and vague feedback. Major project changes were told last minute. Easy A if you follow directions, but you won't actually learn how to do research.

A (non-lockdown) quiz for each chapter, 3 (non-lockdown) exams and 1 experiment and discussion post ever other week.

Gave me 100% on all but one assignment. No tests or quizzes just discussion posts, two papers, and an oral presentation. Would definitely recommend taking her because she's an easy grader as long as you do the work and follow the rubrics.
