Lectures are not too heavy and that's because you will have to do most of the reading on your own. However, the materials were organized into chapters. TESTS are straightforward; she even provides study guides and reviews. You can earn extra credit for most exams.

Since I had a bigger class, it was impossible to talk one-on-one with her. Achieve assignments due every week and they're fairly easy. No pop or mini quizzes. She does give a lot of extra credit on exams. Just pay attention and put in some effort.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTI0MjQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Inspirational--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2022-04-25 16:34:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"PSYCH 2103!!!!! SHE IS GREAT!! Easy class, just do the work! She uses the Learning pad like some psych 1101 teachers. Attendance is not mandatory, all the work is online anyway! You only need to go to class if you want to hear the lectures and work with new people. Lots of group assignments (they don't count! so don't worry!)","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTQ2MjQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2022-04-22 14:14:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"The textbook is available in her online homework system, so you don't have to buy it from the bookstore. She posts the PowerPoint lecture slides for students to review, and spends most of class going over real-world / film examples of the chapter's topic. Super funny, willing to work with students, extra credit available for every test. 10/10!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTI5NTUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2021-11-03 17:41:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! She is amazing. I had her for &quot;Intro to General Psychology&quot; the class was hybrid and class was one week in-person and the next week online. All the quizzes and test were done online.
