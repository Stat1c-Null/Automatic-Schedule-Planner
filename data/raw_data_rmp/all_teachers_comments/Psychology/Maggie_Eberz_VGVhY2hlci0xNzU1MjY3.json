She was very helpful and easy grading, and wanted you to do well. She counted attendance, but also gave extra credit for coming. She gave extra credit sporadically. Her tests weren't overly hard. I had her for a hybrid and all i had to do outside of class was an online quit. I highly recommend her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzg5NTAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
