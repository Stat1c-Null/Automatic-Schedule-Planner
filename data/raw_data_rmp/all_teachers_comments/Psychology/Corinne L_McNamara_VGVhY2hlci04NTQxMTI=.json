Some students may not agree with her style because she's expects alot out her students, but it's worth it in the end. You will learn alot from her if your willing to put the time in. Her tests are tricky, but she will talk you through confusing questions.  Asking for help on her office hours helps. She's very nice and fair.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMzk2MjU1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2007-05-06 12:10:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"very strict, organized and kind of funny.She is very fair and will answer questions that you have.Pay attention in class and you will make it.This is an interesting but hard class.I would take her again anytime.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMTE2NzAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH2201","date_posted":"2007-04-27 14:02:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a great teacher.
