It's clear that he is passionate about what he teaches. He gave tons of life examples to illustrate the material and made the class fun. He does have a midterm and a final, but there are many other ways to boost your grade in the class. I never felt like I didn't have a chance for a good grade.

I am currently in his class and all he does is read off the powerpoint. Also he does not prepare you for the 2 exam's at all! He gave us a study guide with definitions for the textbook and practically none of it was on the exam's.
