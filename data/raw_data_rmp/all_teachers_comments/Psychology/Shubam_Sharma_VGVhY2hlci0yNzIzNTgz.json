The course content is also super interesting and causes you to self-reflect.  Attendance isn't mandatory, but try to attend because she gives random in-class assignments that go towards your grade! Also, take good notes so you can do well on the quizzes. Take her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzE3MDY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Amazing lectures --Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2103","date_posted":"2022-05-06 19:43:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ive never made a review for a professor until now, Dr. Shubam is easily one of the nicest and caring professors you will EVER have.
