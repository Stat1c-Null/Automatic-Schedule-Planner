Lots of extra credit, tests are fair and reflect reviews, he gives great reviews, he's a little quiet and monotone but opens up, he will do whatever it takes to help you, sets up sessions whenever, good lectures, great guy!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNDM2MzIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2025-05-01 21:59:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I struggle with math but Dr Rheem made everything easy to understand! Everything we learn is posted to D2L and he often records videos explaining how to do things. You get 2 full page cheat sheets, front and back, for tests. He is always willing to go back and explain concepts the class doesn't understand. 10/10 professor would highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTI1NDY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2025-04-22 19:06:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Rheem was one of my favourite professors because he genuinely wanted his students to pass with flying colours and explained things so we would fully understand. He was also invaluable and motivated us to fully learn in class. I recommend downloading all the PowerPoint presentations and adding to them during the lecture. He's also funny.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDA2MTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2024-12-13 03:25:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was my third time taking Psych 3000, and it's definitely the hardest college course I've ever taken. I am glad that I chose Dr. Rheem. He is a brand-new professor this semester and was very kind. He makes himself widely available outside of class and definitely wants you to succeed.

It was a bit of struggles at the beginning because he is new. Once we told him our concerns everything went great ! He doesn't want anyone to fail he will help you if you ask .

He will go out of his way to help get your grade up. Gives 2 front/back full size pages for cheat sheet on exams - turn in at the end of class for extra credit. Extra credit for attending SI sessions. Gives extra credit assignments. Lectures didn't start off great, but getting better every week. Would take again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODIwNjk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
