Point system grading. 3 modules no tests but papers which are very short. Final paper is all 3 papers put together. She is very nice. 10 question quiz, online, and reading assignment every week which are very easy and do not take a lot of time.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTcyODg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2210","date_posted":"2025-05-06 03:44:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is nice and class is not difficult","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTcyNjkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2210","date_posted":"2025-05-05 20:50:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Horan is so sweet. She wants you to love Psychology. Although attendance is graded, her class is fun and very engaging. There are no exams, but she does make you write 4 papers, and if you have an A by the end of the semester, you don't have to write the last paper. I highly recommend her if you really want to know what the field is about.

Super personable and always willing to help you out. There are between 2-4 assignments due per week but they're not hard at all. Her class is unique because you have to write a paper instead of taking a test, but the rubric is clear and none of the topics are too challenging.
