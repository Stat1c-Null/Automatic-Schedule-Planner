Long lectures that can sometimes seem like rambling, but with lots of good info. He really enjoys the subject and teaching it. Talks super fast but doesn't mind if you ask him to repeat or slow down.

His lectures were interesting, gives good feedback, answers questions before you even have them, and he is super helpful to any students interested in the field of ABA.  He sets the class up to help students stay focused throughout the semester.  Weekly discussion posts, tests, and a paper are your grade!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDAwNjU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH4345","date_posted":"2016-11-04 14:27:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy is the killer of GPA's. Be ready to take tests (which are online but still hard). He grades objective answers very harshly.  (This is coming from someone with a 3.7 GPA). For someone that preaches conditioning and works in that setting, his constant negative reinforcement thwarts a desire to put forth much effort.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTMwNzIz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

Online exams that aren't too hard if you know the concepts. This was a hybrid so 1 article to read per week and a discussion post. He's easy going and nice.

I wouldn't take this class as a hybrid b/c it is easy to forget what you learned from week to week. Lectures tend to go over time. He is a behavior data analyst, so he constantly talks about his job & seems to expect you to write  like one in your final paper.

Behavior is everything - it's not just for taming autistic kids; look deeper.  Discriminative stimulus has 8 syllables - Prof. Clark pronounces it with 4, because he rushes his words. Rent the Cooper, Heron and Heward text - it's heavily referenced, and will help.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0OTIyODIx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4345","date_posted":"2015-03-25 22:48:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"I like him! There are 4 online tests that are really quite easy. Big paper due at the end of the semester, but he has you submit it in increments and gives great feedback! Honestly, it's kind of hard to get a hold of the guy, but he eventually gets back to you. Lots of bonus opportunities.

Unless you are obsessed with Skinner, because that is all this professor refers too. He's a nice enough guy but his grading is bias, all tests are tough. Zero help with the final papers.

I am an A student and this class was DECEIVING! Prof Clark is nice, but what good is that if the tests are open ended and he grades your responses HARSHLY? Don't get excited about open book tests, its hopeless with his grading. Lectures put you to sleep.

Seth is OK. He is kind of cool but I honestly feels as if he makes the material far harder than it has to be. You have to pay attention in class and he makes you sign in everyday.
