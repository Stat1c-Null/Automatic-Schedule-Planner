When I needed her the most at the end, She didn't even respond to me. If you take her, please make sure you already know how statistics and SPSS works. She won't help you at all.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTMwMzc0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"F","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2024-12-16 16:40:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"She provides the information for each week, so the textbook wasn't really needed. The HW isn't hard once you get used to SPSS. Tests are somewhat hard but doesn't really involve much math. The first two tests were lockdown but the final wasn't. She takes forever to grade though so you won't really know how you're doing in the class until the end.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMzIzMTcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2024-12-09 01:01:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Drohan was so understanding and a great professor there has been multiple times where I turned in late assignments even a month after and she still gave me full credit. I think once you get the hang of things and how to use SPSS the class isn't half bad. I would 100% take her again especially with how understanding she was.

She is very unorganized, namely in terms of due dates and the links to things on the exams are broken. no she doesnt fix this if you tell her. Light workload relatively, but not present as a professor.

However, she does not teach you AT ALL, I spent a lot of hours over working myself, googling, and youtubing stuff that she could easily have taught us in a video. This course is entirely self-taught and she takes forever to grade.
