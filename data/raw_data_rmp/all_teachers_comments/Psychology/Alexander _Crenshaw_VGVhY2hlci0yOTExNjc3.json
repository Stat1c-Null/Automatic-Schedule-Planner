Quizzes were lockdown browser, exams with webcam with odd request like showing your entire room. The grading is straight forward so no hidden secrets but there is a lot of busy work to do. This class isn't difficult, just annoying.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTExMjA2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2025-06-18 17:44:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is extremely tough grader. All quizzes are taken with lockdown and exams taken with web-cam with really weird requests such as SHOW YOUR CEILING???

Though the tests were over 3 chapters with no quiz for each chapter, making it a little difficult. However, if you study good enough, you'll be fine. Beware of Dates.

Not a extremely hard lecture and exams were lecture and text book heavy. He did random in-class assignments so showing up was necessary. As long as you did the homework, attended class and read the textbook you'll be good.

The work is easy and straightforward and the only way you could fail this class is if you don't apply yourself. There are 1-2 random in class activities each week and there are 4 test grades; he drops the lowest one. You can tell overall that he genuinely enjoys his job and cares about his students.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTMzNjM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2025-04-08 18:24:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ok, he isn't racist, don't know what last post was talking about. He is kind of strict when it comes to certain things, but not awful. The biggest peeve I have with this class is the in-class assignments he uses to take attendance, they're just really annoying to deal with, and he randomizes when you have them. Overall, class is ok, but that's it.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODk0ODIy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2025-02-09 05:27:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's new to ksu, so he was rasist. Hides behind and preferred whiteboyz or whitegals. When it should be based on QUALIFICATION, he intentionally used the mainstream language to confuse a person from another culture. Basically, he doesn't even know his own bs and prejudic. Regret staying up late just to battle for \"equal rights institution\". No!

Good at helping you and making sure you understand the material. Not a lot of interactive work, mostly just lecturing. Mildly difficult tests and they consist of a written part, computation, and multiple choice. Final is cumulative.

I think he made a hard course pretty easy, and he was always very knowledgeable about the class material. While his lectures were sometimes dry, I enjoyed coming to class. Take him for stat! He was funny at the most random times too so yeah.
