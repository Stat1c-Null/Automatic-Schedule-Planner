She allows the class to vote on issues such as hw, tests, or anything else. Her tests are very difficult but if she gives you the option of writing a paper instead of a test take it. She is willing to go over it and give you feed back until its due.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTIyNDk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3031","date_posted":"2014-07-16 12:34:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Sharma explains concepts well and grades fairly. Follow her rubrics, do your homework, ask for help and clarification early, and you'll do well.
