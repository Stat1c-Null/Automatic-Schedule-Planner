Attendance is not mandatory but he does throw out pop assignments randomly throughout the semester. They are super easy and often do not take long to do. Make sure to not forget about the job fair or workshops as they count a lot towards your grade! Overall easy class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzcxMTc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2210","date_posted":"2025-04-29 14:47:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"The professor is pretty cool. He will take the time to have a conversation with you if you are interested in anything that was mentioned in class. He gives pretty insightful advice for interviews and careers.

He is very understanding if you cannot make it to class and assignments are simple (gives great feedback too). His lectures are also great! As long as you communicate and do your work... this should be an easy A. If I could take his class again i would. Anybody saying otherwise is lying!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzU1MTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2210","date_posted":"2023-11-15 02:25:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a solid lecturer who cares about his students and can be very flexible if need be. He really wants to prepare you for the real world and is super nice, although class can get a little awkward if no one responds to his questions. No tests or quizzes, only the occasional writing or research assignment on your career interests. Super chill class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzkzNjI5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
