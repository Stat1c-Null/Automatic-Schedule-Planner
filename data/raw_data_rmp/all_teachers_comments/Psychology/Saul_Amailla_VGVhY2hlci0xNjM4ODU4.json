He gives a lot of pop quizzes so if you don't attend class you will miss all of them. Easy grader on final group project. Tests were VERY hard and I never did well on them, I am usually a straight A student. He is an extremely nice person, but his class is not worth it, avoid it!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMjIwMDMy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--TEST HEAVY--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PSYC3385","date_posted":"2018-05-03 08:01:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"He seems to be a nice person just a very hard professor. He lectures extensively and requires a lot of articles to be remembered as well. The group project wasnt bad and he seemed to grade this the easiest. But test and quizzes are very hard also he doesnt allow the TAs to be much help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTcwMjM5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--GROUP PROJECTS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PSYC2110","date_posted":"2012-07-17 16:32:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Attendance is mandatory! if you miss more than 3 classes, it drops a letter grade. He teaches a LOT of information and you just have to figure out what will be on the test (which are very long and dont relate to the material in class). Veryy nice guy, but difficult class","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDk4OTk5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2300","date_posted":"2012-05-12 13:15:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr A is very respectful and polite. He is not good at making the material crystal clear. I would recommend taking him if you want a challenge. His standards are high but not unattainable. I got B, though I could have gotten an A. The textbooks are a MUST! You MUST read chapters for clarity!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjY2MzQ0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3385","date_posted":"2011-11-08 09:30:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Stay Away from this professor in any class! His tests are impossible, quizzes are just as hard, and impossible to write for this guy. In my class 80% of the class is failing because he gave the midterm after the withdraw date (yea, he's like that). You have to memorize EVERY single statistic for the tests. If you get those the rest is still to come","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTg0NTY2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
