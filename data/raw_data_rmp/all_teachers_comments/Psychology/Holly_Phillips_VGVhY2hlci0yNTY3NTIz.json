She tells students what to study for the exam. She does not put grades in D2L, but is a really easy grader. She wants her students to pass!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTc1NjQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH2500","date_posted":"2020-05-22 00:36:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Holly is amazing, caring, and makes the material of methods easy to understand. I took this class in tangent with Statistics and I was a little worried but it worked in my favor. She helped break down the parallel material to a form that humans can understand LOL. Her assignments are used to help buffer ur grade. Three tests and a final.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMzUxMzAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2500","date_posted":"2020-05-13 01:25:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Phillips is one of my favorite professors. Her PowerPoints take all of 10 mins to go over and summarizes the chapter. You should have a copy of the book but you can find a free PDF online. She works with you if you need help. She didn't post grades on D2L but if you emailed her she would let you know. Super essay grades. Minimal homework.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjgwMDc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1101","date_posted":"2020-04-07 01:08:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"You dont have to read much in her class and she is very cool and laid back.
