Only 4 papers and 3 tests which she reviews the tests before the exam day. She knows a lot about clinical psychology and is passionate about it!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzU4ODU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4440","date_posted":"2022-12-12 20:50:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Casey was such a sweet professor. She is a practicing therapist and is able to give a lot of great advice and information about counseling psychology. There are 4 small papers and 3 exams. She grades very liberally and she goes through the test on review day and gives the questions and their answers. Wish I could take this class again.
