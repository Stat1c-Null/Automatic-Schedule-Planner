She was clear in expectations and in notes.  She made the class interesting.  You can make an A in this class, but you must read the book and study!!  She gives studyguides, but suggests you do notecards from the beginning...it helped!  I would definately recommend her and I wish she taught other psych classes!

I'll take it! She is fun to listen to, definately knows what she's talking about. As long as you write down what she tells you to study, you will do good on the test. Easy class - four tests, a few assignments, and a few quizzes. I'd take her again","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzOTA3NjQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2007-10-11 12:09:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very intelligent and congenial.
