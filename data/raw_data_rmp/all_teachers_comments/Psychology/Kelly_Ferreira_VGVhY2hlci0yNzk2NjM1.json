She offers several readings that can help you perform well on the tests! She had quizzes, which really improved my grade! She provides several extra credit chances to help you improve your grade. She is sympathetic, constantly responding to your emails as quickly as possible.

WAY too many assignments and modules a week. I can barely keep up, let alone complete the readings. One 5 minute lecture a week along with 7 assignments is NOT worth the money I spent OUT OF POCKET on this course. AVOID IF POSSIBLE.

The textbook is online and easy to understand, and although the tests are a little bit long (50 questions), if you read the material you'll do fine.

She is so kind and understanding. Also answers emails and any questions very quickly. Get ready to do a lot of work tho. Multiple modules and assignments each week. But because of that workload, it was a lot easier for me to study and learn the content. Tests are proctored and hard, but she gave us curves and lots of extra credit!
