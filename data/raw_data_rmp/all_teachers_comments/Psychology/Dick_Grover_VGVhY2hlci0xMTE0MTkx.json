All tests and quizzes are straight from the book and the practice questions in the book. Attendance not mandatory but having less than 3 absences boosts your grade by 1 point. 4 tests, drops the lowest one. Two 2-page papers. 4 quizzes. And 3 hour research experience. He's alright I guess.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjgxMTUy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1101","date_posted":"2013-04-30 10:44:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor. Book used to review and complete study guides. Information can be very vague. Talks about his motorcycles and his crazy wife a lot. Gives four exams, drops one. Has quizzes but they aren't bad.
