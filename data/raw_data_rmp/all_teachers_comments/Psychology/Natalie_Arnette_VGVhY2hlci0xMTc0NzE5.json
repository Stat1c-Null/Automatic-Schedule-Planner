She is VERY entertaining and has talent for making the subject interesting...do the extra credit!!! Its worth it and she grades with compassion.

Dr. Arnette is pretty funny if you do decide to show up for class though. As long as you read the book you will be fine. The Midterm and Final are sort of hard but she gives you some easy points along the way.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDM3OTMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3305","date_posted":"2009-04-21 14:21:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loved this class! I had her for the 3-hr Lifespan Developmental Psychology. She is totally sweet, really cares about her students, and makes a 3 hour class bearable! Only two tests, midterm & final, with a term paper that can take place of the grade of either test. Take her class if you can!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NjgyNjYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4425","date_posted":"2009-04-12 20:07:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is awesome!

There were only about 5 guys in that class and the women did not complain about men. The topic was about differences between the genders not about men or women in general. Dr. Arnette was a great instructor and it was an easy class. Got an A without much effort. She is really sweet too.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MjQyMzY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4425","date_posted":"2008-12-09 07:35:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you are a guy do NOT take this class.

She has a fairly clear syllabus and provides much of her lecture material online. Interesting subject taught nearly straight from the textbook. The textbook by Brannon is a liberal feminist work with significant misrepresentations. Few men in class. Should be Pscyh of Women.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTU4OTMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH2105","date_posted":"2008-11-05 23:16:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I throughly enjoyed this class.
