Grading was mostly fair. Dr. Marsil was extremely strict regarding grammar and proper APA use. But, don't rely on her APA examples b/c some are wrong. Then, she counted off when I modeled after her's. Grades took 3 weeks instead of the 1 week cited in the syllabus. Some of her e-mail replies were very slow!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4OTY4NDE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3305","date_posted":"2011-08-15 08:41:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took online course over the summer.
