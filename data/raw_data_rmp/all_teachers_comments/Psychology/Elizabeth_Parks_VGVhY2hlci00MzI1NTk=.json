So an easy grader. Her lectures were long and mostly boring. But she gave us study guides every test and as long as you did them you would get an A on the test. Very easy A. And you could tell she really loves what she does.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTg3MDAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCHOLOGY","date_posted":"2005-09-18 22:30:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fantastic teacher!
