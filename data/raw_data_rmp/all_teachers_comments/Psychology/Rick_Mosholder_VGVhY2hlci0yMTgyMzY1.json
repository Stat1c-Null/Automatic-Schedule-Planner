Basically all of the work is busy work and an easy A, just annoying. There were like 13 online quizzes based on the ready (again easy- just skim it). He likes using technology but sucks at it, he screwed up online assignments so many times. A few group projects.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTk4OTIz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
