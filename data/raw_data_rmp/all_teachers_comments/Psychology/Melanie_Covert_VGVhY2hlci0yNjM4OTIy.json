There are some tests and a paper you have to write but overall if you put in the effort its a really easy class and she is a great professor.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDM1MjAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2103","date_posted":"2020-12-23 05:09:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Covert is amazing! Very easy A class. 2 exams. 2 papers. 1 presentation. Lots of extra credit opportunities. No lockdown browser on the exams. Very straightforward class and she tries to make each chapter interesting by doing interactive activities in class.

Quizzes from chapters, 2 tests, annotated bib, 1 presentation, 1 big paper, and some other small assignments with that. Taking her next semester for Cross Cultural!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTA1NjQy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3355","date_posted":"2020-12-16 16:50:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"There is a lot of reading, however, the quizzes are open note, so make sure you take good notes. There is a weekly group meeting and a reading reflection, which is very easy. The two big group projects are challenging, but not too difficult if you follow the directions. However, the professor is strict about grading the projects.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTAwNTMy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH2103","date_posted":"2020-12-15 20:15:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's very caring and understanding about anything you just have to email or talk to her. She has her own practice so she is really busy which I liked because she is straight to the point and doesn't pile on busy work which is great if you work full time or have other responsibilities outside of school.

She's really sweet and nice, and seems to genuinely care about her students, but I think she is a little bit disorganized. The class itself wasn't too difficult, but sometimes her instructions could be pretty unclear.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDMxNjc4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2103","date_posted":"2020-11-17 03:47:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Covert was one of the most understanding and helpful professors. Two exams and a final. Two papers. And one presentation. I would highly recommend.
