I still remember his enthusiasm for psychology which showed in his dynamic teaching style and his interest in teaching the students. His research classes were the best! Though very challenging, I definitely knew what I was doing by the end!

He used a new teaching method that was of no use to me and confused me more. He never answered a question clearly and his essays were dreadful to write--I love to write but his unclear and unrealistic expectations didn't make me want to write anything in his class! I'm an A-average student and I struggled to maintain a B!

You have to do your homework, come to class, read your textbook and be actively learning to do well.
