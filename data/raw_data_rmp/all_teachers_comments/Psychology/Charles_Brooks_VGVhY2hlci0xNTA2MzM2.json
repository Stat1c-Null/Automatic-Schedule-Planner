Gets distracted VERY easily & takes forever to grade assignments. Unclear about what you will be tested on and is confusing. He says one thing in class while the book says  another, making it hard to understand what is right and wrong. If he doesn't know the answer to a ?, he ignores you. Not Recommended.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzEwMzAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH4430","date_posted":"2012-05-10 18:20:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Brooks is a good teacher just distracted. Four tests graded on a curve and a few other simple assignments but it takes FOREVER for him to grade stuff and post the grades. Heâ??s a cool guy and a good professor.

Ignores you if you raise your hand. He said attendance is mandatory, but has only taken it 3 times since August. Tests come straight from PPs, which are posted on Vista, and he gives a study guide. Easy class is you just do the work.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjIyOTQ2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH3305","date_posted":"2011-11-06 11:24:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have not purchased the textbook for this class. Almost everything on the tests are on his power points. He rarely takes attendance, curves his tests, gives extra credit, you dont need a textbook, and there are no papers.

Classmates prove him wrong all of the time, and he ignores when people have their hands up for questions, I'm assuming since most of the time he can't answer them.
