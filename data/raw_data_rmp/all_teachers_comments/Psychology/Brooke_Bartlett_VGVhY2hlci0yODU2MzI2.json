I was skeptical at first because of the negative reviews, but she was my only option, and I do not regret taking her. I took her for a 7-week II session, and it was a lot of reading. She is very test-heavy, so prepare to study hard. She drops a lot of grades, which makes it easy to get an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjEwNTkw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1101","date_posted":"2023-07-24 22:32:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"*PSYC 2500*\n\nActually surprised by the low rating for Dr. B. I found her to be pretty straightforward, but there is a lot of work and it is a difficult class. Stay on top of your deadlines and do all of your assignments: they help you with the final paper.
