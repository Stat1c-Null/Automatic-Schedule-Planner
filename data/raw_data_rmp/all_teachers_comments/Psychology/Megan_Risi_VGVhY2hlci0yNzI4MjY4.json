Only 3 tests, including the final, but all are very strait forward. All assignments are easily doable as long as you read the notes or listen to lecture.

She makes her lectures engaging and interesting. She is also very kind and understanding of any problems you might have.

I loved her lectures. As long as you paid attention in class you really could get by without reading the textbook. She gives study guides for all 3 exams and the final was non cumulative.

Tests are easy and the homework assignments due one a week were pretty easy. My only complaint is that she takes FOREVER to grade exams. Aside from that, she a pretty solid choice. Just show up to class and take half decent notes, study the study guide a couple days before the exam and you got it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDg2NjU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

Take her if you are considering it. Attendance is not mandatory but she does use lecture questions on exams. Her lectures are not boring and class is not a drag.

She's honest with us when it comes to her own issues with mental health and jokes around a lot. Definitely take her, especially as a Psych minor.
