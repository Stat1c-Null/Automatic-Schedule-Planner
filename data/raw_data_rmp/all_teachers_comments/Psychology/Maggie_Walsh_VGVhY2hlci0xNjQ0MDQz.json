If you need an easy A,don't need to learn subject, go ahead.Pros:encourage you to study by conducting regular quiz. CONS: she may skips 2 or 3 chapter, but will include those in exam. You need to study by yourself. Boring lecture.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDE4NjA2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3305","date_posted":"2012-11-21 01:12:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr.Walsh is so fun and full of life! I took her class as a hybrid. There are 3 test & a final, lots of quizzes, one easy  television assignment, and attendance grades. She also gives a lot of extra credit, so do not be afraid to answer questions in class! Test are extensive, but she gives you a study guide that really helps. Take her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODcxNzcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2012-11-20 10:38:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love her!
