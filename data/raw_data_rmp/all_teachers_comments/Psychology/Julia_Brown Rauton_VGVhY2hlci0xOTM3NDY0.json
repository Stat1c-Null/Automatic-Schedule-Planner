She gives you a study guide & goes over all the answers to it. The tests are an exact replica of the study guides. She marks on the syllabus the days she takes a participation grade, so basically when you're required to show up. Her lectures are long and  you don't learn much  she just tells stories.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTgwMTQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2015-08-17 13:26:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing professor.

The tests are just like the study guides, I would look at them 15 minutes before class and still pull a mid B on the tests. Put in 10% effort and you'll make an A.  Unfortunately I only put in 8%, oh well.

Long, long lectures that last the whole hour and 15 minutes. Has guest speakers throughout the semester. Study guides exactly like the tests. Not worth taking notes because of the study guides.
