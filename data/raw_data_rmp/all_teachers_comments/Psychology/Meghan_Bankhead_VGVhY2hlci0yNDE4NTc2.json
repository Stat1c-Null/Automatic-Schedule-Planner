She was very responsive and work was always straighforward. One thing I wish she did was be more hands on, which may be a plus to many people.

The work load isn't bad as long as you plan it out throughout the week. You have weekly LaunchPad assignments to complete, Quizzes in D2L over the chapters every few weeks, and there are three tests.
