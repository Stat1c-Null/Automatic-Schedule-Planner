Yes, you have to read, however the books you are required to read were written for the general public and are not text books, therefore I found them to be very interesting.

She grades really hard on the experimental research paper and is sometimes unclear about what she's telling you. Watch out if she's having a bad day because it might be a bad day for you too.
