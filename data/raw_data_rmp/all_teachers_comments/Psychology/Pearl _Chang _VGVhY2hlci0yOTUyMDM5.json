Her tests are difficult and so different from the class material in the textbook and the short robotic lectures.

Don't take her. The class itself isn't that hard, but she's really bad at lecturing, her powerpoints never make sense, she's rarely accessible outside of class because she never answers emails. I wish I could write more but there's a character limit.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTQ5OTk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"86224","date_posted":"2024-05-02 11:28:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Chang is a nice person, but the course is very unorganized and does not have any sort of studying material for the tests that are super hard.
