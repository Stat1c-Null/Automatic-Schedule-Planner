Consisted of a semester long group project, along with 2 online quizzes every week, and 3 tests. Attendance is MANDATORY. The class is definitely passable, but you have to work for it. Dr. Garefino is a sweet lady but not my favorite course.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTQwOTEw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
