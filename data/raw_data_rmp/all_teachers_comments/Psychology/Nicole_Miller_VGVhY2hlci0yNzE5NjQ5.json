I have to say her lectures are infuriating to listen to so far. The amount of mispronunciation of words, using the completely wrong words, words slurring together, and constant use of \"umm\" going on in such a short lecture is like nails on a chalkboard for me.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NzE4NzI4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3205","date_posted":"2024-07-22 16:56:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"if anyone had her for psyc 3205 can someone like this if her exams were lockdown with webcam pleaseeee","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjM2MzU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4460","date_posted":"2024-05-05 17:25:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"There was a lot of reading and weekly discussion posts, but they were not awful. There are four exams plus a cumulative final, but if you did the first four exams and are happy with your grade, the final is not required. There's a project at the end but it was not bad. The only thing is her exams can be tricky but she does give you a study guide.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzY4OTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4460","date_posted":"2024-05-02 20:24:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is my second Class with Dr. Miller after also taking Psyc 3205 with her.

She has a lot of work on MacMillan that at the end of the day doesn't count toward much of your grade but is required.  If you work hard, you can definitely pull off an A, but you need to study well as there is a LOT of information. I plan on taking her again in the Spring for Psyc4460.
