But she is very kowledgable, wonderful person, cares about students and is always looking to help students when she knows they need it. Wonderful in lectures, and gives projects that actually have something to do with the topic. Her tests are difficult, but I loved her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDk0Mzgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4440","date_posted":"2015-11-03 20:56:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Coyne is an amazing professor and I would take her again. She breaks things down perfectly and if you raise your hand and express that you are still lost she will make sure that she doesn't move on until you understand the topic. You need the book in her class but not so much, she post her powerpoints online. Her tests are TOUGH though :(","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzM2NDEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
