He uses a point system instead of a traditional scale and gives a ton of extra credit. Attendance is not mandatory but his lectures are very interesting, so I would recommend still going for that reason. Easy tests, online quizzes. Not a lot of work.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzUwOTA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Hilarious--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2017-05-19 14:29:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"The textbook will help you with the tests, but it isn't really necessary if you take good notes.
