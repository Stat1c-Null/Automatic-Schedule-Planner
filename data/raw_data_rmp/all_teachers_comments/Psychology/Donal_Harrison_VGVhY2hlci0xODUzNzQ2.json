The notes are straight from the book so attendance isn't mandatory but it was helpful because he will answer questions and class discussions were interesting.

He is funny and sarcastic, which is great. If you ever need help with anything he is more than happy to help you and will actually make sure you understand the material. He is definitely one of my favorite professors! I dreaded research methods before his class but he made the class enjoyable. Oh and he is adorable!
