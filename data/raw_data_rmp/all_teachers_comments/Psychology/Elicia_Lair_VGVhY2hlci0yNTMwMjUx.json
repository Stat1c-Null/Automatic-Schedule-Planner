She can easily be contacted via email, and is a wonderful grader who offers great feedback. I have two main issues: the exams/quizzes and the due dates. There is some confusion of when certain assignments are due. The exams were difficult and she uses a Lockdown webcam browser.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDkyNzQ2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PSYCH2500","date_posted":"2019-11-11 03:51:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love her, her class is so worth taking !","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzkwNjk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2019-11-10 20:11:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"I take her online psychology class and it is a lot of work. The assignments are spread out and you can use notes on test and quizzes. There are 3 test and 8 or 9 quizzes I believe all using a lockdown browser. There's also discussions and Sona that you have to participate in but it's super easy. Kinda easy class with LOTS OF READING AND NOTES!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzg5MTg2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PSYC3325","date_posted":"2019-11-05 19:45:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is Professor Lair's first semester at KSU. I currently am taking her social psychology course and enjoy every minute of it! She is very clear about her expectations. In my opinion, the weekly quizzes are more difficult than her tests. But when I say the only downside of her course is mandatory attendance, I mean it. Not too much work!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzYyMTMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2500","date_posted":"2019-10-30 20:36:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is awesome!!
