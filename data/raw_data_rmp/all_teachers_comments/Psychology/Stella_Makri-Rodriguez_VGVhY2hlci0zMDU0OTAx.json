She is very knowledgeable about her field and genuinely lets the class be an open discussion so that you can hear different perspectives. There are 2 essays and weekly quizzes. The rest of the work is a semester-long project that talks about a mental health topic of your choice.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDYzMzE4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4440","date_posted":"2025-04-14 22:30:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. M is a great professor for Clinical/Counseling psych. She is super knowledgeable about the field and is very experienced in the content matter itself. The material of the course is not too difficult, only two papers, and 1 easy quiz every week. Make sure to read the textbook. Attendance is mandatory, but she also grades based on participation.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTM4OTk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3335","date_posted":"2025-04-01 17:01:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"does not teach well, nor does she give clear instructions. teacher is poop. she also does not give second chances, even when it was her grading criteria that caused half the class to mess up. Plus she doesn't have a math rate my professor.

Lots of quizzes that are very easy and open note. Answers can be found in the book. I think that her midterm and finals are very heavy in how you have 3 different paragraph questions that are based on films and videos plus about 40 MCQs. 2hrs for each.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTI3OTUz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
