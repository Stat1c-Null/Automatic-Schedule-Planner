There's a discussion post and quiz each week, and we had 4 exams (lock down browser) but lowest got dropped. If you do the work and study the lecture slides, you'll do ok though. The tests are hard but DP and extra credit help w/ your grade.

Her lectures and assignments was interesting. We had 5-6 labs throughout the course, alongside 3 speaker reflections. We had 3 test which we could use 2 notecards on, and the Final had a take home portion with it. She is very understanding towards situations with her students, and overall a great person.

She gives us enjoyable activities and takes attendance by daily participation. I really enjoyed her class and even looked into if there was any I could take in the future as well.

I went through some personal issues and let her know ahead of time that I wouldn't be able to make some classes, and she was VERY easy to work with. She is very personable and funny, I love her . Seems like a lot of grades in the gradebook but so easy to get an A if you just do them.

The class itself was very informational. Be prepared to work for the grade. There's a lot of coursework, but they aren't extensive or boring. Exams are in person but she always helps you prepare!
