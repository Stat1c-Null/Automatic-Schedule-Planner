He's vague, but it's  just because he's not particular. More than willing to help and answer any questions!

He is a little vague, but he's also really nice and tries to help. A lot of students major in Psych thinking it's all about counseling or Freud. There's a reason the degree is a b.s., not a b.a.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MjkwNTMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSY4499","date_posted":"2010-11-11 14:49:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Firment is great! His teaching methods are  effective & he manages to encorporate humor. At the end of the semester he was very open to suggestions about the course. If he seems vague it's because he has faith in the intelligence of his students. If something seems unclear, just ask.He'll be more than willing to help, he wants you to do well.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzU0NTcx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2300","date_posted":"2010-02-10 10:31:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Delights in making others feel inferior.

He is not always crystal clear, but he works very hard to ensure that his students learn the material well. He is always available for help and is remarkably tolerant of poor students because he WANTS them to learn.  He's highly entertaining and kind, as well as brilliant. He isn't easy, but he's good.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MjA4NDI5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2301","date_posted":"2009-04-07 09:55:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"A lot of people hate on Dr. Firment saying hes hard and tries to make it hard on students, not true. I took him for 2300 & 2301 and loved him. I've learned so much in these two classes. He is also funny but sometimes unclear.

He seems to take pleasure when his explanations confuse. He smiles when students become frustrated with material. Firment sometimes teaches backwards, the last concept first and the intro concept last. He takes joy in creating stress in students.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTgwOTMz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4415","date_posted":"2009-03-16 17:43:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the most arcane and obtuse teachers I have ever met. He is quite unable to see the inadequcy of the materials he uses. His answers to straighforward questions make the answer even more unclear.
