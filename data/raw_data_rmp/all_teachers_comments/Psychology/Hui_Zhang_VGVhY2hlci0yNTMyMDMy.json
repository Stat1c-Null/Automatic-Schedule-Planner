I worked for her as UTA for the online version, and she doesn't assign that much work. All students really had to do were discussions and an easy, semester-long assignment. The material is already incredibly dry, but she does her best to teach you in person.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzI0MDE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2500","date_posted":"2020-05-06 17:52:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"You have to do work. It is not an easy A, but she is the best professor I have ever had. Gives great opportunities for extra credit. She cares about each individual and wants you to succeed.

She avoids putting any form of trick questions on assessments and offers any help to try and help students succeed. Although having the textbook is helpful, I managed fine without it, and her activities were always incredibly easy to do.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODE3Nzc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2500","date_posted":"2019-12-18 05:26:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Material is straightforward. Her power points are very vague so you HAVE to read the book. One chapter per week. 12 quizzes (2 dropped), 4 exams, and a guided research project. Her grading was more than fair.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzAxNTMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
