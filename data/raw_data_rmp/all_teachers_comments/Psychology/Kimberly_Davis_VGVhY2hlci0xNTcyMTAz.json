I rarely used my textbook, but if you're looking for an A, I suggest reading the chapters. She does have some small in-class assignments and a few bigger writing assignments. She does challenge you to think AND learn APA citing. Overall, LOVED the teacher and the class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTA1NDA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
