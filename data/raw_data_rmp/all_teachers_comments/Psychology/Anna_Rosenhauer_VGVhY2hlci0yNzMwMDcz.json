Shes also very funny and keeps me entertained. She has a lot of assignments and extra credit to get your grade up because the tests are hard. Good teacher if you want to do psych careers.

The material in lectures is very pointless and she gives way too many tests, to not teach a thing. I do not recommend.

Amount of content present in class is three classes worth of material. Professor zooms through said content leaving no time for students to comprehend material, and expects students to dedicate majority of their time to her class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDIxOTc4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC-1101","date_posted":"2022-03-24 14:31:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take a different Professor. She goes too fast through lecturers and the tests count more than anything. Tests have 5 essay questions all worth 10 points.
