He is the toughest grader I have ever had. For example, I usually get A's on every essay, but with this class, I cannot even pass one. You only get 1 minute per question for quizzes and offers no extra credit no matter how much you beg.

You basically have to read the textbook and learn the material in your own time. The \"practice questions\" in the slides are way easier than the actual quiz questions.
