Lectures and exams could be a little confusing, but overall, she was an awesome professor and I always enjoyed attending classes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjUwMzgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4345","date_posted":"2011-05-17 21:16:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Parks is awesome and so cool.  This class was worth every penny.  It's not an easy class and some information is hard to understand.  The exams are some what hard but they don't count for much of your grade.  Most of your grade comes from the experiment & presentation you have to do...do everything she tells you to do and you will get an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjIyMjUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3345","date_posted":"2010-04-24 16:50:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"I'm so glad that I took this class with Dr. Parks. She is an expert in the field of behavioral analysis and really knows her stuff! She is kind, understanding, and very helpful. Sometimes class tends to be a bit long-winded as she likes to talk. But she is a very fair grader and a wonderful person!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDUyOTc5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSY3300","date_posted":"2009-08-24 09:46:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"dont need to attend class.  she reads straight off the overhead.  gives you a study guide that is exactly like the exam. you have to write a paper, but it's about yourself, so kinda cool!  she doens't teach much outside of the book and you NEED the book.  everything comes from it!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MTQ2MDc4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3305","date_posted":"2009-06-23 18:37:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"I didn't enjoy the class that much. But I loved the teacher, she was great. Had one paper due and most people got 100's. So an easy grader. Her lectures were long and mostly boring. But she gave us study guides every test and as long as you did them you would get an A on the test. Very easy A. And you could tell she really loves what she does.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTg3MDQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
