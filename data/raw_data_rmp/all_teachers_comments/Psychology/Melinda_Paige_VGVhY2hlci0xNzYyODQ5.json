She teaches in a way that helps students to know how to APPLY a concept (instead of only knowing the definition). I would definitely recommend her!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDU2MjE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH2105","date_posted":"2012-11-12 11:40:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"All you have to do in this class is discuss issues with the class, do a service project (could be small), a group project, and a reflection paper. It is all very easy and Mrs. Paige is one of the best teachers ever! Great facilitator and super nice!
