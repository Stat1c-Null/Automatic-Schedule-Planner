Absolutely the most attentive professor I've ever had in my college career.  Willing to go above & beyond for students and makes the material fun and entertaining. Wonderful sense of humor! On the first day of class he mentioned that his &quot;HOT&quot; rating on here wasn't so high, I'm helping Ace out! :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzMzMDAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCDEV","date_posted":"2009-01-12 03:19:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hagebak is a great professor, he goes out of his way to help his students. He always treated us with the utmost respect. He is a great life-span teacher because he himself has lived through many of the life stages (He is in his mid 70s). I highly recommend him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzU3MTk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSY2000","date_posted":"2006-12-07 10:19:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"good professor, good skills and experience.  a welath of good info and experience.  an &quot;ACE&quot;","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNTQwNjQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LEADERSHIPPSY","date_posted":"2006-03-29 23:05:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hagebak is the BEST teacher at the college. I took leadership b/c I first had him in phsycology and I loved him and his class. He is very witty, knowledgable, and really feels empathy for his students. He tells stories which are entertaining, and he is able to incorporate creative learning techniques. Above all he cares about the STUDENTS!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExNjMyMDQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LEADERSHIP","date_posted":"2005-05-05 08:27:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"I LOVE Dr. Hagebak. He's nice and funny and very organized. He gives out a class syllabus and actually sticks to it, so as long as you have that you'll be set for knowing when things are due and such.
