She is probably the worst professor I have ever had. Quizzes are nothing like what we learn in class and there are three huge assignments all due during finals week. She acts so nice in class, but communication outside of class is terrible.

Class consists of going over PowerPoints which have NOTHING to do with the quizzes or any other assignments we have in the class. At the end of the semester three large assignments are all due within a week of each other (a research paper, presentation, and the final exam) avoid her at all cost","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mzc5MDk4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2500","date_posted":"2024-04-13 23:53:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"I don't recommend Professor Griner. Attendance is taken for a grade, but going to class did nothing for my learning in this class. Everything I learned was on my own through the textbook, and she was no help with the paper we had throughout the semester. Big paper due at the end, and a final exam. She also provided no study guides. -2/10.
