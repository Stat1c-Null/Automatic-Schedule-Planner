What an incredible twit. 0% teaching, 100% memorizing powerpoints for easy multiple choice tests. Class is pretty easy if you don't mind wearing cotton in your ears. He is probably the most worthless professor in the psychology department.

He tests off his powerpoints and out of the book. He uses personal experience and stories to explain concepts, gives u something to relate them to.

He is very knowledgeable in I/O field, and gives lots of exmaples, but nothing related to test really. Talks way too much about personal life, and will spend 45 min on 1 slide. Pushes back tests several weeks, and tries to cram info in at last min bc he talks too much to cover all of material.
