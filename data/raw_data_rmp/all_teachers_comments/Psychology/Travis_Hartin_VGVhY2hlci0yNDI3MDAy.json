Don't buy the book because his tests are from the slides. Has very dry humor, like Dr, House, that you'll miss if you don't pay attention. Encourages class discussion even in huge lecture hall. Easy and clear syllabus. Follow it, study for tests, and you'll get an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTgyODg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Hilarious--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3205","date_posted":"2019-12-15 20:12:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easiest &amp; best professor I've had.. while he was here. He was unfortunately ill &amp; could not lecture the last 2 months of the semester, but he was very easygoing &amp; graded fairly. Super easy A. My 1 complaint is that even without lecture at the end, we were given a very difficult cumulative final from the sub that he made from home w/o a study guide.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjY4MDk5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Graded by few things--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3205","date_posted":"2019-05-01 15:07:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Favorite prof. at KSU. His classes are always laid back and his lectures are really interesting. The tests are easy--its usually a mixture of multiple choice, vocab&amp; free response. If you study the PP's and show up on review day you will do well. class participation grades is just answering review questions from the previous class, take him!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzMxMjEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Hilarious--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3205","date_posted":"2019-03-18 21:42:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Travis was such a great professor! He made sure to change up his lectures from time to time and showed videos in class. He's a cool guy and easy to listen to. Very entertaining and funny without trying to be. 3 article critiques, 3 exams, and in class participation grades make for a very fair grade. Take him!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDQ5MjIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3205","date_posted":"2018-12-07 11:26:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I wish this professor had more reviews because he really is such a cool guy! The class is not mandatory and it is fairly easy. He is also just super genuine and is always willing to help. I feel like he goes over and beyond to help everyone understand the material/pass the class. He enjoys what he teaches and it's exciting to watch him teach.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTA4ODYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3205","date_posted":"2018-11-28 21:51:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"His class is really easy and he's a very cool professor. The powerpoints are basically the exams so the textbook isn't really needed. The class has three very small papers (minimum 1 page). Attendance isn't mandatory but it is helpful to listen to his lectures instead of teaching yourself.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODA4Nzc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2300","date_posted":"2018-11-17 09:21:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Hartin is amazing.
