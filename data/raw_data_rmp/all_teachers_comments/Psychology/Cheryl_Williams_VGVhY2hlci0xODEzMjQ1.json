The entire class was discussion based, but this is not AT ALL what you are tested on. You will have to read the textbook  and teach yourself. Not a friendly person and I haven't learned anything from the class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjYyMzUw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3385","date_posted":"2013-07-17 13:01:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"I left the class with an A, but that was because the class was a joke. She was rude and condescending to any student with differing opinions. She had unfair expectations given the lack of instruction. The grade felt given but still not worth it because of how stressful the disorganization was in the first place.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTc1NTM3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3385","date_posted":"2013-05-31 22:33:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"This course offers you to engage and you need to participate in group/ class discussions. This course includes 3 quizzes, one final, and several assignments. The quizzes later became substitutions for other assignments because the quizzes were difficult. The professor is highly intellectual and she is lenient.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxODUxMzQy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSY3385","date_posted":"2013-05-17 17:42:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"WORST Professor I have ever had. She had students converse the entire class about topics not on the test. There was NO direction with homework, projects, or tests. She was snarky and rude when asked questions. She never input grades, and she assigned material a day before it was due. She didn't create one test question herself. Completely horrible.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzg0MzY2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3385","date_posted":"2013-05-10 11:00:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class was easy however, the professor was very unorganized. She is a new professor and it shows. I didn't learn anything, and she does not lecture. She does not give study guides and her class discussions have nothing to do with the actual class material. She does not generate her own test, so she cant help you with the test. Proceed with caution.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzI3NDg0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH3385","date_posted":"2013-04-28 17:53:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"No.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjIyNjk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
