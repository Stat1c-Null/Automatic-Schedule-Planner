If you work full time, then this is not it for you. She'll have assignments due on a Wednesday, and tests on Friday. Does not make sense since online is to support those who need to be flexible with their schedule. Anyway, do not take her. I'm giving you a warning.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTc3MTQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2011-11-28 16:25:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took her online class. It was awful. She does not understand how to use the software and communicate with students. She is very late with emails and does not communicate assignments. When the system goes down, or if she forgets to post an assignment she will still make it out to be your fault. She takes shortcuts with discussions. do not take her","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzIyMjA4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2010-10-29 17:48:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy.  She offers up to 5 points to be added onto your final average in the class if you get some papers signed at info tables.  Tests are ridiculously easy.  She is super laid back on the group project. She brags about how she has a doctorate from ga tech, but she isn't smart.....she just reads straight off of the slides. It's sad.  Take her","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzA5MDc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1101","date_posted":"2010-05-12 19:20:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ditto to the previous poster. She does, however, give many opportunities to make an A with extra credit items and with credit for attendance. But there is a test every 2 weeks covering 4 chapters with many terms to learn/memorize.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTg2ODA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1101","date_posted":"2010-02-05 22:08:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hickman just reads off the power point slides and expects you to remember 30+ terms for each test (most of them run together). Not very helpful at all. All you do here is memorize, and memorize, and memorize... annoying class and teacher if your schedule is busy already. Not recommended.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Nzg2OTk1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
