You get to pick your own group and you guys decide on a research topic. This is a semester long project and you will be doing multiple drafts of your paper, building the experiment, and working on SPSS with your data. She lets the class decide on a lot of things and asks for feedback.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTI2MzMz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3395","date_posted":"2025-04-28 12:52:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took professor Kulibert for psych of prejudice + privilege and LOVED it. be aware that this class requires group in-class activities weekly, and independent critical thinking skills. Some of my peers felt the instructions for in class activities were vague, but that's for good reason. the professor wants to prompt, but not control, discussions!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDY3MDg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4100","date_posted":"2024-08-15 13:30:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Kulibert is a fantastic professor. They are a literal superhero. They are very passionate about what they do and in and out of the classroom, they want you to succeed. They're insanely friendly and personable and I always felt prepared for the assignments. I genuinely would take them for every class if I could.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Njg0MjIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH2500","date_posted":"2024-04-27 16:32:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Kulibert is a decent enough professor. I won't lie, there are better professors for this course, Kulibert sometimes comes off as inexperienced and a bit unorganized. However, Kulibert is fiercely kind and was helpful and understanding towards both me and my group project members. There were a lot of assignments, but they weren't too hard.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mjg1Mjgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4100","date_posted":"2024-03-22 23:07:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall has been understanding and organized from the start. There are a lot of assignments but they give a lot of guidance and is willing to answer questions or move around deadlines if students need. They allow the students to decide/bote on course changes, which is nice. treats students as adults and with respect. I appreciate that about them.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDc4MDU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4100","date_posted":"2024-03-21 14:37:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"RUN! She is so unorganized and tries to come off as relatable, but she's the exact opposite. She doesnt offer any extensions, and barely responds to emails. She randomly cancels class right before it starts, and is very confusing when it comes to assignment information. She is absolutely terrible, and she never takes accountability for mistakes.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDcyMjkz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
