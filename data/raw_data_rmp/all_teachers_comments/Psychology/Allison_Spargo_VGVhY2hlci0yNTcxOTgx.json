If you email her, politely, and explain a situation she will work with you. I'm a C student and I got an A in her class. When we told her the 150 question test was too much, she curved it, and fixed her mistake for the next test. Just communicate.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTMyOTA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH4430","date_posted":"2020-02-08 18:52:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take her! She is unorganized and does absolutely nothing to help her students prepare for her 150 question exams PLUS a short essay. Her syllabus dates are off, she copied and pasted a different professors syllabus, so she barely know whats going on. No study guide is given for a 150 question tests!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODk4MTUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
