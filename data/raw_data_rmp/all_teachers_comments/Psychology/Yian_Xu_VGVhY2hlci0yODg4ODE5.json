Her laid back vibe is an absolute nightmare. You won't know til the last minute if something needs redo. Xu forced teammates for TIMED phonecall when SOME were at a 9am through 5pm job. Not doable at all 10 slides project in FINAL EXAM week?

Accent can't be understood, overbearing to wait forever for EACH FOUR writing grades. Maybe she should drop some of teaching loads cos she always seems stressed. Plus she's new (2022), totally rubs interest in psych.

It's not really feedback when she has NO rubric whatsoever whats right answer. By the end of the course, everyone is more confused LEARNED NOTHING.

She took a class that I had been told would be super difficult and made it super manageable. She gives great feedback and allows you to resubmit your papers once for better grades. There is one group project which covers 2 assignments which is 30% of your grade, so be strategic in picking partners.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjEwMzY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":16,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4100","date_posted":"2023-10-25 04:21:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"I thought she was very nice and if you ask her any questions she gives very concise feedback to help you. very fun class and easy","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzA2ODAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":16,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
