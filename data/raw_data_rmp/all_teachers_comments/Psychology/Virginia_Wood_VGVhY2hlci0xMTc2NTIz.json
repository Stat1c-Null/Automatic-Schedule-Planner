She was not organized, and was very scatter-brained. She also made inappropriate jokes about her clients often, it made me uncomfortable. She was unclear about what she expected on papers. I made an A, but I would not recommend her due to her teaching style.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzU3MTg0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH4420","date_posted":"2009-01-06 09:16:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was down to earth,the material was alittle redundant;however she was more concern with us learning &knowing the material.Attendance is a must!
