You do not need a textbook because we read actual articles that are all online. There is 300 word article analysis due twice a week but honestly they are not hard to do. Love him and would take him again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTkyNzYx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Skip class?

He was an amazing lecturer and offered inspirational insight into psychology's darkest of theories. He is a tough grader on test and essays, but in the end you'll be glad you took him! Comments are time consuming, but are well worth the inside knowledge. Be prepared to work (but you'll enjoy every second of it)!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTYzNzkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3335","date_posted":"2013-11-12 09:05:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a pretty cool professor.  Loves what he teaches and it shows.  He wants you to succeed and will do what he can to help you do so.  Go to class and don't be late! If you're late you will only get 1 point.  Do the extra credit work, it's easy and will help you.  Study the essay questions and you will have no problem with the exam. He's funny","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjk3NjI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSY4440","date_posted":"2012-01-09 13:28:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I might not have gotten the best grade, but is was not from lack of this teaching.
