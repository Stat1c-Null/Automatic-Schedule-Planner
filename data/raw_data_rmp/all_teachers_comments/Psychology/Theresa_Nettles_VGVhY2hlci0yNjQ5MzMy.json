She is very sweet and understanding in any situation and always makes sure you are able to do your absolute best. The tests nor the quizzes are extremely hard and she is a very fair grader. I will miss having her as my professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDk1NTk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PYSC2103","date_posted":"2021-05-12 07:50:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"very unorganized professor, did not abide by syllabus. impossible to reach outside school or via email, and give attitude when asked questions. quiz and homework heavy though no clear grading criteria as she again doesnt abide by syllabus","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzcyODEx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Get ready to read","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PSYC2103","date_posted":"2020-12-26 22:32:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Nettles was probably one of the best professors I have had at KSU. From the first day I could tell she really cared about her students and I loved her class so much I decided to switch my major to psychology! She's very accessible outside of class and wants to help you in your circumstances. I genuinely loved her online lectures.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjAxMzU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2103","date_posted":"2020-12-08 02:19:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"all work was through online textbook site. super easy. just complete the online work and youll get an A. is a lot of busy work though. classes were actually interesting and she's cute.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTc4OTk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
