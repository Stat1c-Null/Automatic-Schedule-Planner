Buy the book and study the power points.  Must attend the study groups because all you need to know on the test will be discussed. We had 1 group project and other small assignments(fun).  Easy A-just be on time for pop quizzes.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDU0Njgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
