She Lectures from slides which are posted online. You should attend class for better clarification of slides. Over all she is a good teacher. 5 question quizzes, which are randomly picked from notes, so you must study entire chapter. 3 papers 4 quizzes, 2 test and final.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzI4MjA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
