She stood behind the computer the entire lecture everyday, and read verbatim from her power points. Random class participation was given. She reviewed the previous class for 20 minutes at the beginning of class, but wouldn't discuss topics because of a \"lack of time.\" Textbook is a must","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDQyNzg1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-12-11 01:39:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was the worst professor I took this semester. The class average was a 68 & I had not even heard of a person who made above a C on her exams. She does nothing but lecture & give tests. It is completely up to you to learn the material and she gives no homework or study guides to help you with the tests.

All she does in class is read powerpoints verbatim and is so boring you'll want to cry. Her tests are heavily based on the book (which is an INSANE amount of reading) but she has stuff thrown in that isn't anywhere to be found. She will do nothing to help you pass.
