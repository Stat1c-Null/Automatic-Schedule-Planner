Pretty unorganized and hard to get in contact with since he is a neuropsychologist (never responds to email) and has a family, but it all works out in the end. He realizes his actions and will make a test open-note or what not to make up for it. He is amazing in lecture.I found a new love for psychology thanks to him","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTU5OTcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2105","date_posted":"2014-10-29 07:48:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"GREAT TEACHER!!! he KNOWS and LOVES the material.

I studied a few hours before each test and got an A on all of them. He is extremely unorganized, but he keeps class interesting and gives all kinds of extra points. If you really want to learn material, then this class may not be for you, but if you want an easy A, then take this class!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjM1OTQ5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4410","date_posted":"2014-03-07 17:02:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Funny guy.

Very easygoing, funny, willing to help. Sometimes hard to get in touch with quickly, but that is understandable as he is also a practicing Neuropsychologist.
