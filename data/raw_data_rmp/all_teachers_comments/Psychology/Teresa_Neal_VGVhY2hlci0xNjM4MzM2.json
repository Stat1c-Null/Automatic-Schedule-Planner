She is hilarious and really understands college-aged kids. I took the hybrid course and we met once a week just to discuss different topics. Tests are online, where you can find most of the answers. Very smart lady. Take this course!!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTA5MDk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2013-04-07 01:24:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"My first Hybrid ever and I love it. Class is easy, not mandatory, but it helps since there are in class assignments. TA grades our work. Work consists of Journals and Discussions (Easy!). Tests are not too hard, review and know vocab/concepts. Very nice. I signed up for her Developmental Psych class in Fall as a Hybrid too.

She is a very easy grader and gives fun lectures. Attendance is kinda mandatory in that she will randomly take it and it will affect your grade so go to class. She is very sweet and understanding. There are weekly discussions and a journal every other week and 5 quizes all online. Book is used some. Take Her","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDkxNjY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3305","date_posted":"2013-04-05 13:45:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful teacher! Make sure you attend class, it's a big pat of your grade. Her class is fun, organized, and keeps you interested. Make sure you read,it's important.

I really wanted to learn something, but I feel that I walked out of class knowing just as much as I did going in. 6 papers, 4 online tests. Lecture will not help for the tests or the papers because she doesn't really teach. it's just Youtube and group work.
