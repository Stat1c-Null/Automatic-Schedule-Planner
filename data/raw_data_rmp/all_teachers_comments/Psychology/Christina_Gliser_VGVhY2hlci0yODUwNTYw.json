Her test are based on her notes some could be from the powerpoint some could be from a 50 page reading. She knows what she is talking about and very interesting but be prepared to read a lot.

Took her for Abnormal Psyc. She is so caring, smart, and knowledgeable! Test can be detailed and you need to read the book and attend lecture but honestly she makes it interesting so you want to participate. If I had the space for the credits I would take her for a different class. Highly recommend!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTAyNzI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Amazing lectures --Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
