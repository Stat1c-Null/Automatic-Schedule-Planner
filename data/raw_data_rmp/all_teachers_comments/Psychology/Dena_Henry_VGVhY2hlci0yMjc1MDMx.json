If you don't do this, class will be very unenjoyable and she will refuse to elaborate on material for not putting the work in that you should be. Her class is easy enough if you read, show up, do the quizzes, and study for the tests. Not my favorite, but she's fine.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODYwMTA2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--Skip class?

She isn't good at explaining concepts and uses bad examples. She does have group work, online quizzes.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDE5MDQ1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
