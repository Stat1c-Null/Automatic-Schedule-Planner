She comes into the room on the first day and informs us she has a day job that her grades might be delayed. (That was an understatement) You HAVE to read the book. What she covers in class is nothing like thew book and the test are on the BOOK!

That being said, I feel that the professor done a lousy job of doing this. She was unorganized, pretty bad at facilitating healthy discussions & graded work at a snail's pace.

Gives pop quizzes, midterm & final are over readings. She doesn't give a study guide, but instead gives you a very vague idea of what is on the test. Two reflection papers & requires a reflection journal for each class. Wouldn't recommend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzAwODkz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3395","date_posted":"2015-05-27 15:33:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had a 4.0 before I took this classs, not anymore.
