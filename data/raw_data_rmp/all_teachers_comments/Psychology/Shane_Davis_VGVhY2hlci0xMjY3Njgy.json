Make sure you read and take good notes from EVERY chapter because the pop quizzes and tests come straight from there. I agree with others that she can be a little unclear on instructions for tasks as well as what is going to be on the tests.  Overall though I would recommend taking her class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Njk3OTY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC3325","date_posted":"2010-01-08 12:27:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall, Dr. Davis was a good professor.

Very upbeat and fun. She keeps me interested, not to mention she's a fox. Class is challenging and you do learn. Beware of her deadly almost-daily quizzes, though. They're rough. The tests are multiple choice and straight-forward.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mzc5NjYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4430","date_posted":"2009-07-31 23:19:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Davis was not a good teacher. Her expectations are extremely unclear. You have to basically teach yourself in this course. All she does is read straight from her slides. Her tests were extremely difficult. She gave very little direction on the paper and then graded it very harshly.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDgyNzEz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4430","date_posted":"2009-04-07 09:52:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a nice teacher however she is very unclear on what she expects in her assignments. There was only one grade recieved before midpoint and 8 (2 test, 1 case analysis & 5 journals) due at the end of the semester.

She knows a lot about disorders and the abnormal world, but she doesn't teach it well. She reads off powerpoints, and expectations are unclear.
