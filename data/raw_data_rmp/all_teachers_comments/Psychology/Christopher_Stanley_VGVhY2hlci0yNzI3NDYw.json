He gives detailed feedback and makes it impossible not to pass this class as long as you submit everything. I received a 100 on every assignment I turned in. He is very organized and gives one assignment a week. So easy. Also, fun to learn this material!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzE3ODAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2103","date_posted":"2022-05-03 01:15:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Professor Stanley's statistics course, and it was way more straightforward than I expected from a math course. The textbook was helpful, the assignments had clear instructions and actually understandable. I had to write this review because 10/10, recommend to anyone taking stats to take this course and it helped me understand stats better.

His weekly assignments are fairly easy, however they do include a bit of writing, but the assignment is easy. The test are usually five essay questions, which are also easy and straight forward. Great online class experience, strongly advise taking him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTUwOTk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC2103","date_posted":"2021-11-23 01:50:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class asynchronous and it was easy.
