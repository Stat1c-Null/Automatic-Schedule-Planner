You have to practically memorize the text book in order to do well on the tests - get a paper copy of the textbook. No electronics allowed in class. Two big papers to complete, overall not horrible and very insightful. Tells a lot of personal stories in class. Reads directly from ppt slides.

She laughs after every sentence she says and takes it personally if you leave class early. Wont send attendance sheet (10% of your grade) around until the end of class. No room to miss a day.
