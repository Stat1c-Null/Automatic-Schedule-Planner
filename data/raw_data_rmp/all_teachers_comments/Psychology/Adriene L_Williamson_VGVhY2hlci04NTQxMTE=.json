She is very good at dumbing things down for everyone to understand. She does count attendance, but you wouldn't want to miss anyway, there are a lot of notes, and you'll do much better on tests if you go.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MjA3MDIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSCYSECT","date_posted":"2007-11-07 01:21:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took her Psychopharmacology class...her exams are hard, but she is very helpful.
