Attendance isn't mandatory but he does do \"Concept Checks\" at the end of each class. He drops your lowest four so you can afford to miss at least 4 days. He spends time trying to help understand the concepts rather than just memorize.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTAyMzk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
