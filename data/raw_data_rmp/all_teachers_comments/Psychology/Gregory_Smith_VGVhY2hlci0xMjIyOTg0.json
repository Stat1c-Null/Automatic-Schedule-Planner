He never showed up for class, didn't answer any of my emails, forgot to meet with me when I requested to discuss class material, and just read from the power points, that most of the time he would forget to post. I would advise anyone to never take him. He doesn't care about his job teaching and it shows.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTE3MDQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2010-08-02 15:30:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Smith is a working psychologist teaching for an extra pay check. Don't expect any help from him at all, he truelly doesn't know how  to give it. More than half our class was struggling and we all went to him to find out what we could do to get better grades. He said we were his worst class ever and that we needed to study harder 20+hrs wasnt enough","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDcyNDM1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1101","date_posted":"2010-04-21 13:27:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is super hard.

He missed classes and to &quot;make it up to us&quot; scheduled 4 tests during the last month of classes...all tests ended up being online.

He missed almost half the semester's classes, read directly from book's powerpoints, could not remember what we did in the classes previous, wastes time, does not have a firm grasp of the material, and he DOES NOT RESPOND TO E-MAILS. He does not treat the class like it is his job.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDQ1Mjg4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2009-05-17 14:05:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Everyone keeps saying how hard he is, but if you pay attention and study, it's not hard.  I barely missed getting an A in his class.  Granted, I did study, but it's not supposed to be a slacker class.  The bottom line is, if you study, you will get a good grade. If you don't, you won't.  It's not his fault.  It's yours.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODU0MTEy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2009-01-08 13:39:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"DONT TAKE HIM!!! his tests are awful, i studied for hours on end and still failed. he didnt help me when i i asked to meet in his office when i was having major trouble.  also, he will refuse to return the tests to you for studying purposes.  the grade is composed of only tests, and SONA research grade which amoungs to 5%.  comprehensive final.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzQwNDUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC1101","date_posted":"2009-01-08 12:57:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely hard class even though its intro!
