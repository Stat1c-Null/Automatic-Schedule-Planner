But it really feels disingenuous when she does things such as gives 0's on assignments I entirely did and followed instructions to a T. It's the fourth week right now and I have had multiple problems with this class each week.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NjMwNDg0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYCH1101","date_posted":"2021-12-16 17:58:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"She replaced my prof in the middle of the semester.

I took her class online, and I was surprised at how much I was able to learn from an online class. She grades everything promptly, is understanding of late work, and actually gives feedback. Shes honestly the dream professor to have. If you can manage a spot in one of her classes, take it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTUwOTI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PSYC4410","date_posted":"2021-10-06 19:03:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is amazing!! The class itself is pretty easy. It consists of a few discussion posts a week, Mindtap, and a few papers. Nothing too crazy whatsoever. She genuinely wants her students to succeed and overall I really enjoyed this class.

She really goes above &amp; beyond for her students. For example, I am in the process of landing an internship with a Clinical Psychologist. Not only did she offer to be my reference, but she actually called the establishment while she was out of the country!

If you put effort into it then you should definitely pass. Grades consisted mostly of discussion/reflection posts and MindTap activities. The discussions arent difficult and the professor isnt a tough grader at all. There was also a final project which wasnt too difficult.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzgxMjk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3700","date_posted":"2020-12-22 17:49:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wasn't a difficult class, mostly discussion posts and a few papers but overall a solid class.

She teaches online-only courses from her home in Montana, I believe. She truly cares for her students. She always provides great feedback and typically responds to emails/calls within 24 hours or less. She teaches both LDRS and PSYC courses. 10/10 will be taking her again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzc4OTE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
