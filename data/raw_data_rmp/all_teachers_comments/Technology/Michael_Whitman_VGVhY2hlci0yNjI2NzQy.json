But make sure you start on them early. The two tests are literally just key terms and definitions. Plus, in the discussions board, he answered questions we asked as a way to contact him. Not bad at all, but don't expect easy.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mzc3OTY4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR-3300","date_posted":"2024-05-04 15:36:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"I appreciated how organized Whitman made the class. There are no quizzes but he makes up for that with the brutal test i never had such a hard time studying for exams due to all the  terms to memorize. You`re graded on few things so you cant screw up and there no excuses or make up work it would have been nice to have a one time makeup assignment.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzYyNTYw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR7300","date_posted":"2023-12-07 18:12:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took CYBR 7300 online with Dr. Whitman. The class entailed 2-3 projects which were laid out clearly with explicit instructions. The 2 exams covered key terms. You have to study/read/watch lectures to succeed, but everything in the class was fair. Overall, I enjoyed the class and would take Dr. Whitman again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTU4MTgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR7300","date_posted":"2022-04-20 01:49:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class was difficult overall. Group projects were involved and exams tough. Please be aware that Michael aka Mike Whitman has most of his ratings now under a new alias on this website as M. Whitman. For any approvers reading this, professors should be held accountable and should not have multiple aliases. Mike aka M. Whitman are the same person.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTA4MzUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR7300","date_posted":"2022-04-20 01:43:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was a very tough grader, never available to connect via phone or in person. His exams were inconsistent in language, and length, and prepping for it was nearly impossible. His grading criteria were not clear and assignment grading was unnecessarily harsh, compared to other professors. Most importantly, his conduct was abrasive and rude.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTA4MzAx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR7300","date_posted":"2021-08-16 04:29:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor I've ever had. He's known for his tough talk. I'm surprised previous ratings for him have been taken down. He takes no excuses, is a tough grader and will let you know there is nothing you can do about it. He ought to stop teaching and concentrate on writing books to sell to students. You must buy his text book to pass his class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDI5MzAz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
