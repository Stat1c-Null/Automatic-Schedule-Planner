He'll make you think you're doing well and then give you a poor grade without even discussing the reason why. Even though you did all the work. Poor feedback.  Tough grader. But without justification.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NDMzNzQy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME1311","date_posted":"2016-05-20 15:22:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Well ... very professional and respectful guy, but the course is really tough. He does not require any book and motivates everyone to look up online for whatever needed (that is a great part).

His teaching style is flexible address different learning styles of the students. The course is a tough course, though, but he makes it to the simplest way possible. Although with high discipline, but always smile on his face. Very cool and  ice personality.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NjI0OTkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME1311","date_posted":"2016-03-21 13:27:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Where to begin. This professor knows his MATlab. However he is without doubt the biggest regret I have made in my entire college career. Bare in mind I am a 3.5 3rd year Engineering student. No one knows what is going on in this class and there has only been one grade turned in. And its almost april. DO NOT TAKE AT ANY COST. KSU is Embarrassing","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTY1MDkx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
