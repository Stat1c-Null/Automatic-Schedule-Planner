Her lectures were always directly applicable to the assignment that was due. I never felt unequiped, because she was thorough with how she demonstrated functions in Figma. If you're messy with your design and its organization, you will see LOTS of comments. She emphasizes this so don't slack!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzg1MjU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IAD4200","date_posted":"2025-01-13 06:57:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lupo is an awesome professor and ive learned SO much in Figma from this class. if your saying her grading or criteria is incredibly hard you rly need to lock in or just GO ask for help. Lupo does a great job of challenging us and if you're struggling ask questions (she always ask if we have questions) and you'll get the feedback or help you need!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTM2MTM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IAD4200","date_posted":"2024-12-03 20:04:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ms. Lupo is strict, clear, and sticks to her syllabus exactly. Attendance is crucial, and optional days are key for application. Missing assignments is risky, with only one redo allowed at semester's end. Her short classes pack vital info, and she's specific, concise, and question-ready. I'd take her again and take advantage of communication.

My main issue was that it was incredibly difficult to meet her criteria without clear examples of what she expected out of the assignments. Her rubrics were very vague, so the grade I'd get often felt like a coin toss. I also find her feedback a bit hard to follow. A tailored word document would be more efficient.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDUyNTE5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IAD4200","date_posted":"2024-11-20 03:51:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"this was her first year at ksu, so im sure she'll change some things but for me the class was very difficult, her grading criteria was clear but at the same time she graded super harshly and never showed us any examples of what things should look like. also she is STRICT on deadlines, so just keep that in mind. i think she's a good professor though","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTg4Mjgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IAD4200","date_posted":"2024-11-14 17:52:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ms. Lupo hands down was one of my favorite new professors. She is extremely helpful inside and outside of the clasroom. People complained about her grading and how she was unclear but these were the same people who would NOT ask her questions when she offred her help....make it make sense.

She's really helpful and accessible outside of class. Some other students complained that she's a bit monotone during her lectures, but that has never bothered me.
