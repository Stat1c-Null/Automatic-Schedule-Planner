As long as you do your work on time and review all of your work, it's almost impossible for you to fail. He really cares about your success inside &amp; outside of the class. He gives a lot of extra credit. You can only have 3 absences so don't skip. He's an older guy, but he's fun!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODQ5MjEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
