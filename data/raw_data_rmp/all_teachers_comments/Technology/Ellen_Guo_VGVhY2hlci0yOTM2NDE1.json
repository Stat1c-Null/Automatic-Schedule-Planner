In both classes she was well prepared and made the class participate voluntarily. The quizzes and tests are knowledge based and does not go over anything she has not thoroughly taught. She will provide you with constructive feedback, especially in Prototyping.

She can be  tough grader but she's not harsh and she offered feedback whenever I needed it. I took two of her classes in one semester (Prototyping and media culture) and passed both with an A. I recommend  taking her if you need those classes, she is great.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjY5NjQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IAD2100","date_posted":"2024-03-21 16:26:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's super caring and also very young which makes it easy to connect with her. When I took her class (fall 2023) I believe it was her first time ever teaching and she was an easy grader. she does take attendance every day but sometimes makes class optional when were working on projects. she also communicates great with deadlines and expectations","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDcyNzUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IAD2100","date_posted":"2024-02-27 15:38:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Guo is great! She is very knowledgeable and cares for her students. Her class is very hands-on which helped me a lot. You get to practice using prototyping tools in class so that you can get help if you are confused. Easy class and you will do well if you pay attention and do the work following the instructions closely.

As long as you do the labs/projects you will get a good grade in the class. Professor is available for feedback if you finish your projects early so you can improve it and get an A. Professor isn't great at lecturing, but you don't really need a lecture to learn how to use Figma.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzA2NDcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
