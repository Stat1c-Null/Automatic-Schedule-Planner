His personality makes the lab more enjoyable than expected. He could not have taught S&amp;C L any better as his first time. All students like him as he is funny but also well respected. If you do not get an A in this class, it's most likely because you skipped lab and quizzes.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Mzk2MTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Would take again","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
