He cares about his students doing well and is always available for questions. 4 tests and about 1 quiz every week to every other week in person. Material is straight from PowerPoints and there is a helpful review session for each exam. I will definitely take him again if I get the chance!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDI0Mjk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES2100","date_posted":"2024-07-31 19:52:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lectures are neat and straight to the point.

He made learning very interesting. My favorite teacher is the ES program. Quizzes in person, and 4 Exams but everything was straight from the powerpoint. If you study, you will get an A. He gives opportunity for extra credit. He is the absolutely amazing 10/10 recommend.
