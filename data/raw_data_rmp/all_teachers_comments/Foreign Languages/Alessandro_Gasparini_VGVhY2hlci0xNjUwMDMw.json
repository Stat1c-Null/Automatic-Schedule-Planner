It is hectic, crammed, and disorganized. Not necessarily his fault, but don't do it online. Lots of studying, lots of learning it on your own. This class resulted in overwhelming anxiety and stress, and it's my elective.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Njg4Mjc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"1001","date_posted":"2015-04-02 21:22:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Gasparini is an excellent teacher. He responds to emails and helps as much as he can. Working hard in the class will go a long way too. Stay on top of Discussion Board posts and read the book. Tests are easy. There's an oral exam too, but it's less than 15 mins and over skype. Great Professor. I highly recommend taking his class!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTM4OTE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITAL2001","date_posted":"2012-05-10 13:36:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor. As with any foreign language, a LOT of effort and memorization is required. However, Prof G was always helpful and just a really nice guy overall. Pretty lenient with grading.

I find his style of teaching to be really helpful. There are 4 required hours in the language lab but you can just work on Quia (online assignments). Does exercises in class, and sometimes he just talks about what Italy is like. I'd def. recommend him!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTMwNDYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITAL1001","date_posted":"2011-11-21 09:39:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a real nice teacher. He's very lenient on many things. Attendance is mandatory but it's really not that bad. You learn quite a lot and he's a very easy grader. As long as you do the quia, spend one hour in the language lab, pay attention in class, and study, you'll get an easy A in this class. Definitely recommend taking Prof. Gasparini.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5Mjg4Nzcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
