Teaches brasilian portugues instead of portugal portugues which I loved! The book is extremely helpful and he gives homework out of it also. He gives several great resources and is more than willing to help any way he can. Funny too :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDk4OTYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PORT1002","date_posted":"2012-05-03 10:33:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had him for both PORT 1001 and 1002. I wish he taught the next level. He challenges you, but don't get discouraged. It isn't hard to get a good grade if you go to class and take an interest in the language/culture. Extremely friendly and laid back guy. Keeps class fun and makes it enjoyable to learn a new language. Take these classes!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTg0OTgy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PORT1001","date_posted":"2012-05-02 22:07:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have never met a more friendly and helpful professor in my life. Dr. Braga is a language genius, and he genuinely wants to share his knowledge and help you learn. You can tell that he sincerely cares about every student and about the subject matter. He went ridiculously out of his way to accommodate me and my needs in his course. You'll love him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTgxMjQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
