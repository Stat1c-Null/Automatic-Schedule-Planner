German is a tricky language and she expects a lot of effort from her students, but is more than fair and always happy to help and explain things if you get confused. I would recommend her to anyone taking German!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjY4ODQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1002","date_posted":"2013-03-29 00:34:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome professor from Germany. Expects you to work hard, but doesn't have unrealistic expectations. I would highly recommend taking her if you really want to learn German. She is challenging, but very willing to help you until you get it. Brings food to the roleplays and had a lot of insight into German culture.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDYxNzc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
