She was extremely knowledgable about her subject material and she really worked with her students so that they gained confidence in their Spanish speaking abilities. I would undoubtedly take her class again and I recommend her class to everyone.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjY0MjEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1001SPAN102","date_posted":"2018-03-29 15:49:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have had her for SPAN1001 and SPAN1002 she is the best teacher ever!
