He is familiar with Latin as well. His lectures were always funny and insightful, and he'll understand if your attendance was lackluster due to work/other classes. He'll enhance your understanding in easy to remember ways.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjA5OTA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITAL1001","date_posted":"2023-07-10 17:04:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was so sweet and understanding that students have other classes and will extend due dates if you reach out to him. His material is so easy to understand and grasp if you just take the time to study. His quizzes are 5% and it's mostly about how you're progressing through the material; there are 3 main projects that make your grade and are great!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDk1NTg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITAL1001","date_posted":"2023-05-09 16:37:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"genuinely such a sweet man!!

He is like a high school teacher in a way. His class is very easy and he is very understanding and lenient when it comes to turning things in late. He gives 3/4 test, a couple oral exams (which you can record or preform live),a final, and gives several opportunities for extra credit.

He had moments where it is hard to understand him or the point he was trying to make, but overall he was wonderful.
