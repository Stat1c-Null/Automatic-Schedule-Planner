The class isn't easy, but that is expected when learning a new language. Plenty of quizzes throughout, she is always willing to let you make up testshw. 1010 teacher. Study and you'll do fine. I'll take any KOR class she teaches.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODM0NTcx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1001","date_posted":"2015-03-18 21:40:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really great teacher. Sends lots of emails for assignments, study guides, and in-class review. Gives students a voice in directing the class - as in, what to put emphasis on. Lots of homework, WB pages, vocab quizzes. You have to make a korean children's book. Also, you submit voice recordings of reading passages often. Overall, good class","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDc1MzE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
