Although there is a bit of a language barrier when trying to communicate with him, he is very adamant about helping his students pass. If you show an effort and at least try, it will not be difficult to make an A or B. He does not mind absences as long as you let him know ahead of time. I loved his class!

He can be a bit hard to understand at times but he tries his best and it leads to some fun discussions. He has you do all the homework assignments in class, as long as you follow along you will have your homework done. The French department forces Supersite so there is no avoiding it. All in all, he's very helpful.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTE0MTEx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FRNC1002","date_posted":"2012-10-31 00:10:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is extremely easy, however, you will fail without a textbook. All of the work is done out of the text book and the assignments are posted online. After each unite there is a simple test to take. Attendance is not necessary however he gets mad if you do not come to class. He has trouble explaining things and is very boring.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzU3MTgz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN2002","date_posted":"2012-10-18 23:32:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Definitely disorganized and could not really explain WHY certain grammar needed to be used.
