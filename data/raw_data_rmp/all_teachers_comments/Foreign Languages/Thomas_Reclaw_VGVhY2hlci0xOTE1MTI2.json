He values the students interest in the German language and will help you whenever he can. Class participation is a must with his class. If you come to class, talk often and generally try to communicate with him, he is very understanding if you have a hard time with the language.

He's super excited every class and is really focused on his students actually learning the language rather than just passing for the credit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTkwNDQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
