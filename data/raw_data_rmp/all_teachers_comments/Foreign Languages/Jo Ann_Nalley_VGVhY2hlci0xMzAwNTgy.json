Made Latin very very easy. You would have to be a huge screw up to not get an A in her class. I will absolutely take her again! I recommend her to anyone who wants to take Latin. You can't go wrong with her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzA2MTA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LATN1001","date_posted":"2009-07-06 20:01:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not the greatest class in the world. You are basically clueless as to what your grade is the entire duration of the course...until the end of the semester when your tests and workbook have been &quot;misplaced&quot; by the teacher. Really really nice and fun teacher...but not really organized. Don't take this professor if you actually want to learn Latin.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDE4NzE3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
