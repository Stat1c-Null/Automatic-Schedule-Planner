She takes time to help out her students, and is very lenient in grading. Gives second chances on many assignments and genuinely wants you to do well. You feel very comfortable in her class, as I got away with saying ridiculous things all the time (my accidental mixture of Spanish and German). Would happily take again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjYwNDY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"80693","date_posted":"2014-12-15 21:43:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Frau Crooks is a GREAT teacher! Her family is German so she knows a LOT about the language and culture. Very funny and one of the most helpful instructors I've ever had; she never hesitates to help you out when you are stuck. I have to take 5 language classes for my major and am sticking with her as long as possible.

Really. It was my favorite class and she made it so easy. She brings food as treats for us & the final was the best. I'm taking her again for 1102 & can't be more excited to have her again. She tells great stories & keeps class interesting. I suggest going to stay on top of things. She grades lightly & is understandable w/ things.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDY2MzY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1001","date_posted":"2011-11-29 15:01:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really good teacher, German is a hard language to learn so she makes it as easy as possible. Brings food in. Go to her class! People skipped a lot so we had only about 6 kids in class. She is very nice and always willing to help.

She told great stories and tried to make the language accessible. I've never taken German, and I was able to make an A in her class. The tests are from the department and can be tricky, but she gives you a good study guide for each one.
