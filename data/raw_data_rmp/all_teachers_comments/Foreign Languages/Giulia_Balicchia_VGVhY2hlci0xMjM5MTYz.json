It is a foreign lang. so its gonna be difficult for sum but if you do the work- she'll make sure you get the A- anyone who doesn't- didnt try!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NjE5NzMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITAL1002","date_posted":"2009-09-16 21:17:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"she is amazing...such a great teacher- if you want to learn italian- choose NO OTHER PROF. than her! and it doesnt hurt that she totally helps you with everything you need.

She does follow the book and the first test was extremely difficult because we did not know what to expect, but you do a lot of practice in class. Make sure you do everything and study hard and you should be fine.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTE0NTUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITAL1001","date_posted":"2009-01-07 13:43:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is an Italian native and is new to the U.S. She still needs to establish a teaching style and I found it hard to stay for the entire class b/c she just follows the book. I had to teach myself a lot but as long as you study the book the tests are easy. I made an A. Grade is based on tests and online h/w which can be done until you get a 100.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzMzNTgw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
