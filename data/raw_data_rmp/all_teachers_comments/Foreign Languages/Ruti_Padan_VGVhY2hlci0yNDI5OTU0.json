You will spend most of Biblical Hebrew reading Genesis 1 & 2 in Hebrew & will be surprised how you've learned by the end. She brings a special language and culture to KSU. Anyone with an interest should take her classes.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODQxNzI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HEBR1002","date_posted":"2019-04-23 13:16:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the literal best!

I had her for Hebrew 1101! A plus side is she actually knows the language unlike some  other foreign language professors! I love her and she treats all of her students like her own.
