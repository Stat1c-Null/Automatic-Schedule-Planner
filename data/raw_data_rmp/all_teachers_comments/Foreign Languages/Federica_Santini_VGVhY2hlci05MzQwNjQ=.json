I only interacted with her online, but she is easily one of the best professors I've had here. She's super accessible, and none of the work is too difficult, but so, so interesting.

About 5 books to read and movies to watch, but tbh you only have to read a few chapters to know enough for the discussion/analysis. Bonus points everywhere.
