She engages the class and really cares about teaching German.

I came into this class not knowing much, but left learning a lot. Didn't do well on a test or two, but if you study you'll be fine. Gives a lot of extra credit and work to help pad your grade. Made an A in the class and didn't work hard at all. Just do your work","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODYzMDE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GERM2001","date_posted":"2010-11-05 16:07:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's super sweet.
