She responds to emails very quickly (Literally responded to my email at 1 AM). She really cares for each student. The lecture may seem boring at times but the class is really easy and she gives a lot of extra credit. 2 group projects. Yes, you need to put a little effort in but easy A.

She's absolutely amazing and she really wants you to learn. She's always available for questions and is super caring. I've learned so much and I'm taking her again next semester.

She's really really friendly and patient. I took this class during the pandemic so we had synchronous online classes. A heads up, participation matters. She'll call on you in (virtual) class usually in alphabetical order but sometimes randomly so be prepared.

Workbook, exams, quizzes, and tests were most of the grade. The workbook was easy. Lessons 0,1,2 are exam 1 and Lessons 3 &amp; 4 are exam 2. Tests are after each lesson. Vocab quizzes happened on the first two days of that lesson but could be retaken the day before the test to get a better grade. 100% recommend.

She wants every one of her students to do well. Just do you assignments, show up to class, and study before tests and you'll do fine. The material is definitely harder then KOR 1001 &amp; 1002, but that is expected. There are two big group project assignments which are more annoying than helpful, but besides that, its fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTc1MTAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
