I hadn't paid attention in any of my high school Spanish classes so I didn't really remember anything. You are graded almost every day for participation so no skipping. Even though the class is difficult, Prof. Ana provides extra credit opportunities and is very patient.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Nzg0MTg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1001","date_posted":"2021-03-30 13:01:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Padial did a very good job with this online course. She expects you to submit assignments on time but the course was manageable and she responds quickly to emails and group me. Just reach out to her with any questions and she'll help you!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDg4NDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
