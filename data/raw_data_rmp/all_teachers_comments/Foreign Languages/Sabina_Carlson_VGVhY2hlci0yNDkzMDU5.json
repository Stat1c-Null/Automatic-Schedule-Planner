The assignments are clear most of the time. There is a weekly vocab quiz based off the vocab in the FREE textbook/website provided, then a test after every chapter of the vocab is done (3 chapters). There is group work which is done on teams but is super easy and repetitive, just communicate with your group members!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTQzOTE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1001","date_posted":"2025-04-01 02:31:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Carlson is very nice and caring! I have never attempted to learn German before, but she made the class as easy as possible. She gives great feedback and understands that this is our first time learning German. She always responds to emails in a friendly manner. The class itself is well organized as well. Definitely recommend her!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODQ4MTkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1001","date_posted":"2019-05-13 08:03:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof C is very sweet &amp; caring. I took as an online class &amp; though it was my 1st time learning German, she made it so easy. 3 exams, I got over 95s on all. There are about 8 discussion posts which is just speaking into a microphone. Then there are written things which are easy. She doesn't expect you to be perfect. She gives great feedback &amp; help.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODU1Nzk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
