If you work or take more than 12 hours be prepared to not make an A and maybe not  b. Also, if you miss one class automatic 1 point off final grade.

But that is because its chinese we are talking about. She is an amazing teacher! Really loves to teach! I would come to class very drained and discouraged, but she would fill me back up with encouragement and help me keep moving forward. I would love to take from her again! Fun, helpful and you leave with a great education.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDE1Nzk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
