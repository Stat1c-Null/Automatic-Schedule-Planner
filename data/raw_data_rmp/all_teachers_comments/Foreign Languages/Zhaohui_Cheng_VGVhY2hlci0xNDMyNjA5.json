She'll take the time to help you before or after class, she engages the students, and she really cares about her job and her students' development. Her accent is thick, but if you have the opportunity to take her do so. She's very good.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMDU5Nzk5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHNS2001","date_posted":"2013-04-30 10:24:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall, Cheng is a alright teacher. Had her for CHNS 1102 prior to taking this course- her previous class was MUCH easier. Student will be expected to learn +200 characters/words for EACH of the tests- she does spring POP QUIZZES in this class. Students will make two grueling class presentations. I like Cheng as a person, but not as a teacher.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjM1MDYx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHNS1001","date_posted":"2013-04-27 14:43:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very fair teacher! Take her if you're starting from scratch!

If you dont pass with a B or higher then its because you didnt go. Go to class!

She's the sweetest teacher in the world, and aside from that, she is a great teacher. She will help you in any way she possibly can. She's super lenient on homework and attendance.

Probably one of the easiest language classes I've ever taken. She is very lenient with grading, too. You use the book a LOT, so make sure you get it and come to class. Lots of easy quizzes and three tests, including the final, and one oral presentation.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjcxMTcz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
