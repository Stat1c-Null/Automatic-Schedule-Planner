I had her for only one semester but she was the best! She helped the class as much as she could when trying to explain things. She is going back to Germany for one year, then will  be back to teach for another year. If you are lucky enough to get the chance, definitely take her","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTMxNjYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
