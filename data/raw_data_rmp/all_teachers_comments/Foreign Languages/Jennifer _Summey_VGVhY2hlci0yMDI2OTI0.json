The assignments were unclear, the projects we were supposed to do had cryptic instructions, and up until the end of the year I only knew TWO of my grades. This being a test and a composition grade. Many projects were started and abandoned and the grading on participation was insanely unclear.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjQ3MzY5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SPAN2001","date_posted":"2017-01-05 18:00:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"I didn't need a Spanish, but I took it because I did really well in high school, and I loved it. Took this class, and I'm not taking Spanish ever again. She is nice, but so much homework (faculty assigned, doesn't give good feedback). She doesn't explain it, or teach much in the first place, so you are pretty much on your own. I wouldn't take this","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njc5NzU1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SPAN2001","date_posted":"2016-12-25 16:20:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super sweet and excellent professor! She loves to incorporate Spanish into real life events from todays news. Sometimes she's not very clear on some things so asks questions and voice concerns and she will definitely  address them and work with the class to help you succeed!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjIxMDUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3303","date_posted":"2015-08-11 21:19:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Excellent professor.

She is inspirational and wants to see every student succeed.  She alters the direction of the class depending on what is resonating with the class.  Her delivery of writing and grammar skills are top-notch.  She does expect you to work, and it will \"vale la pena.\"","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDI0MDgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
