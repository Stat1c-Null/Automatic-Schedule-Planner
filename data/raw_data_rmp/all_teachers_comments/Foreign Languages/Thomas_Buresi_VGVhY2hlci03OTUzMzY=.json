Uses D2L, Voicethread, and VHL, so stuff can be hard to locate but just refer to the weekly checklist and you'll get by. He answers emails pretty quickly and is generally helpful. This is not an easy course but it's also not super hard. I've signed up for his FREN2001.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mjg2OTE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1002","date_posted":"2021-05-04 22:57:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a good teacher and the class is pretty easy. The only trouble I had with it was the weekly dialogues where you'd have to practice French with another person for a grade. I hate talking to people and a lot of the time everyone was busy/ already has a partner by the time I could log on. Not his fault, just something to keep in mind.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzA0NzU4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1001","date_posted":"2020-12-17 09:50:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"The only reason I'm giving him three stars is because he didn't teach all semester. It was all based on the expensive textbook. He seems to be a better in-person teacher. I took French in high school so it was easy but if this is your first french class I don't recommend it. Lots of partner speaking activities. He seems nice, just not good online.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTE4NTI5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"FREN1001","date_posted":"2019-11-04 18:54:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took this class for a good foundation. Not even sure why he says he teaches this class when everything is self-taught and all you can do is read the textbook ($250). I asked for outside sources for assistance and was repeatedly told to read the textbook. Very advanced, true beginner class and another shining example of a &quot;teacher&quot; who doesn't teach","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzU0NzQy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"FREN1001","date_posted":"2015-11-05 16:26:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great teacher. He usually only speaks in French, but you catch on quickly. Participation is mandatory, and he makes you have conversations in class to practice. He is also very personable and there if you need anything or have questions. Tests are easy if you study a little and participate.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzUyNTA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FRENC1102","date_posted":"2010-06-30 21:46:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Love him.
