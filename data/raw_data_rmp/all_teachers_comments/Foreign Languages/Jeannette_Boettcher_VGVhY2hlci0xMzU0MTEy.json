She teaches the subject very well- she fully understands what she's talking about (because it's her native language, but still- can't say that all professors know what they're saying).

Self-teaching and studyng are pretty important when you have her. She glosses over vocab so unless you're studying on your own you'll get lost. Tests were easy and there are plenty of chances for extra credit. Besides the tests and final, 3 roleplays and one composition.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTcxMTgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1001","date_posted":"2011-09-21 14:24:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love this teacher! Very fun to talk to about Germany/German, etc. I will admit, things can get a bit difficult if you can't keep up. I have some exposure to German so I am doing just fine.

Knows her stuff but can be kind of standoffish with students. Taught from online book, which got boring quickly, but discussions were lively and humorous. Tests were long and difficult.

By the second class we were already supposed to be able to introduce ourselves, ask for names, say colors, about 20 objects, and speak several sentences.

Test are harder because they are pre-made by the dept head. Mrs. Boettcher tries very hard to answer questions and make the work understandable.
