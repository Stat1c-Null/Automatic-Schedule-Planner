Her methods are group based which I hate! She lost 2 of my character writings, counted me absent for a day I came, and randomly comes up with assignments last minute. I 100% would never take her again. She seems sweet at first but in then end she doesn't care about you.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODM1MjU3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

There is heavy usage of power points and videos, interesting presenters come in when she's not available. Be weary though, Asian culture is mostly focused on Chinese culture.

She truly helps her students to feel comfortable. Some language teachers quickly and roughly correct their students, which discourages them to speak up. But Ao laoshi helps to gently steer her students towards the correct grammar, pronunciation and vocab, therefore encouraging students to SPEAK CHINESE.
