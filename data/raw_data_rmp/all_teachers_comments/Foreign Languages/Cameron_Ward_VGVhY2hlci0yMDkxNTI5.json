His lectures are very helpful and as long as you pay attention you'll be able to understand the material. The only drawback is that he does take quite a while to grade things but honestly he made this semester a lot easier for me.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODcxNDE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LATN2001","date_posted":"2018-04-29 10:08:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Spends most of his time playing on his phone or talking about anything but Latin. Doesnt grade anything until the end of the semester, so you dont know what your grade is going into the final. If you really want to learn, you have to teach yourself outside of class. But then everyone gets an A because he doesnt feel like grading stuff.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTI0NzA4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"LATN1002","date_posted":"2017-12-11 16:49:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Takes a really long time to grade papers. I just did my final and don't know my grade. I only know like 2 out of at least 12 quiz grades and none of my test grades. He's funny but he gets off track so much. I don't recommend taking him if you don't have to, even though he is cute.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTM0NzI1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"LATN1001","date_posted":"2016-05-01 15:36:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is helpful if you ask questions, and gets annoyed when you don't participate. You can learn if you want, or, if you don't, you can still pass. Frequent online quizzes. He takes a really long time to grade papers. My final is in 2 days, and I still don't have the test grade from a month ago. He goes off topic often, but fits the information in.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDI4ODA1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LATIN1101","date_posted":"2015-12-19 18:25:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is hilarious and cool. Very easily distracted, but it is interesting. He teaches the subject with great knowledge, but if you are a serious and very studious person you may not like his teaching style.
