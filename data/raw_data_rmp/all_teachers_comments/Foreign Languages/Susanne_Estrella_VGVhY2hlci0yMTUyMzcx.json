After a while we all just because used to it and it actually started to be kind of fun to guess what she was saying. She was also very friendly, and it was fun to get to know her more.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzAxNjQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lots of homework--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1001","date_posted":"2022-01-03 00:03:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing teacher, but if you think because you have previous german knowledge this will be easy. You're mistaken. There are about 4 different assignments per week which can be a lot to keep up with but its all to keep you on top of the new words and language. All grades in the book are final, so if you miss homework or discussion, 0. Go to class!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1Njg4NDAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

She was so welcoming and patient from day one to the day of the final. She makes class so much fun with little games for every test and snacks to go along with it. I'm so fortunate to have had such a lovely instructor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjQwMzI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1001","date_posted":"2016-08-31 12:53:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Definitely a participation dependent class, but Professor Estrella is really great with giving constructive feedback in a positive manner. As long as you participate, do the reading/homework, and try, you should do fine. Show up to class! After three absences she will deduct points off your final grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2OTQ1OTg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1001","date_posted":"2016-07-25 11:59:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved Professor Estrella!
