Nothing she put out was clear at all. If it werent for people in the groupme constantly emailing her and updating the rest of the class, nobody would have a clue what was going on. The powerpoints and homework were so much easier than the tests. I truly do not feel as if I learned anything from this class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTQxNjAw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SPAN2034","date_posted":"2020-11-20 22:27:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is by far the worst one I've ever had at KSU. She isn't clear in her instructions for homework and oral presentations. She doesn't email students back in a timely manner or at all sometimes and she doesn't read emails in its entirety. The homework is for completion only so you don't really learn anything unless you read the book.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODYxMjY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SPAN2034","date_posted":"2019-11-25 20:51:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not everything was discussed as to what would be on each test, which ended up giving the majority of the class low grades. Even the few Spanish speaking students had problems. She grades very hard, expects you to not pause during oral group presentations and doesn't offer extra credit. She doesn't post lectures on D2L, so write FAST or take pics!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDc2Mjk0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
