There are vocab quizzes, but we always spend pretty much the whole class going over the vocab that's gonna be on the quiz anyway. The tests are a little harder but if you do the workbook pages then it shouldn't be too confusing. Plus she offers make-up tests!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU1MTU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
