Most of the grades in this class come from participation and presentations. There are also some vocab quizzes, but we hardly review the vocab in class so be sure to study those on your own.

Dr. Kelley doesn't usually teach straight from the textbook. Instead she explains grammar rules and vocab and then gives the students a chance to learn by speaking and listening.
