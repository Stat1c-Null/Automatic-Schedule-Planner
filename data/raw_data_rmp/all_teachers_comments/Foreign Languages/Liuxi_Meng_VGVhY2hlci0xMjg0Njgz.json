He provides positive feedback, is incredibly kind, and jovial. I took this course over the summer and although it was labor-intensive, he's not a picky grader.

It's an easy A if you do the work. If you don't turn in your papers, he emails you and gives you an extension. He even accepted my paper two weeks late and still gave me a 90. He is very forgiving and understanding. Wish I could take him again.
