She is impossible to reach by email, shuts down the materials making it impossible to review, has unclear grading material, and assigns so many papers. I have so many more negative things I could say but unfortunately the word limit won't let me. Take someone else for your own good","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzgxNzUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FL1002","date_posted":"2022-10-11 21:41:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was okay when I met her over a video call but on email, it was an entirely different story.  She also randomly expects full-length papers out of the blue. This was my first introduction to learning ASL formally and it left a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe she'd be better in person but online is a no go -1/10 would not do again","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NjkyODE1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FL1002","date_posted":"2022-05-23 10:00:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dropped this course halfway thru. It was so hard to get in touch with her as she would not respond to emails. Also, almost weekly, you would have to write a 1-2 page paper, single spaced and cited, about a video about deaf news which I found overkill as there was not that much to talk about. Uploaded ASL vids with no context. Don't take her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzkzMzQ5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
