Online discussions due dates were never discussed in class or on the calendar so they closed before anyone even knew they were there. All work is busy work. My french has not improved at all in this class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTU2MTI3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN3302","date_posted":"2014-04-21 23:46:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am obsessed with French, but I hated this class. Lot's of projects and participation points. She's nice and will try to help you, but she won't really correct your French. My French didn't improve, even though I got an A.

Although she's extremely nice, her directions aren't always clear. In addition, when she gives assignments, she doesn't immediately tell you the due date. It could be weeks later before you know when something is due.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjM3NzE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN3302","date_posted":"2013-12-06 16:49:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"I'm a French major and was excited about taking a French Conversation class. She's a nice woman, but I don't feel like I learned much. I'm more comfortable speaking and making mistakes, but that's due to the work I did outside of class, practicing with French club. A ridiculous amount of homework, very little of it related to conversation skills.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDU2NDk3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1001","date_posted":"2012-12-04 15:06:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the best French 1001 professor at KSU if you really want to learn. Her teaching style is the best and makes you confident. Class conducted in a circle so you get to know your classmates and Dr. Hoyt very well. She is a really nice lady and very helpful. Take this class.

I'm nearing the final week of the semester, and I have learned RIEN. She is a nice woman, but this class is boring. She doesn't correct your spoken french during class. She just gives a sympathetic nod. No more purple sheep. Fruit should be eaten, not worn on the head.

Nice woman and means to have her students succeed but does not host the class as such. Extremely disorganized and just generally an awful class. I dreaded going and her grading system just sucks.  You'll have oui/non, 9 out of 10 and things like that so you have no idea what your true grade is.  BUt you can do well, i guess.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTY1Nzcw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN3302","date_posted":"2010-05-10 20:58:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really liked Dr. Hoyt. She was very fair. She won't compare you to the rest of the class but rather she just wanted to see that you were trying. She's very sweet and she's super helpful if you meet with her outside of class.

She makes us sit in a &quot;U&quot; shaped style and is involved 100%! She helps you understand the pronunciation and correct grammar use, hard on on her writing extremely, but easy on other assignments. Fun teacher, hard grader though!
