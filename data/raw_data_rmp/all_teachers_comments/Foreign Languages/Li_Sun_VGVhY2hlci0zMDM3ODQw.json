There are 2 exams, a few class assignments and discussions, and a group project. She lets you make up misses work with a small penalty. The only hard part are the 2 exams, which are open book, as she expects well crafted answers.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTk4OTUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ASIA1102","date_posted":"2024-12-03 16:41:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a pretty good professor, the lectures aren't hard and everything is posted online to check later. Barely any assignments, and she is a very generous grader. Gives good study guides for finals, but doesn't give much time for the major group project towards the end of the semester.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDc5NTA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ASIA1102","date_posted":"2024-11-25 20:17:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"You can pass her class only if u go to class and do all the discussions.

She's so sweet and genuinely cares. It is a very easy class. It's lecture heavy but tests are open note and fairly simple with no lockdown browser. She is very understanding and truly wants everyone to pass. Slight accent but nothing terrible, you can still understand her pretty clearly. I'd 100% take her again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODUyOTAz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
