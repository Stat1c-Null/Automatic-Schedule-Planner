We watched a movie and then read a book! We had 3 tests, homework, and papers. He is super helpful and always available if help is ever needed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MjI0NjQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN4402","date_posted":"2021-12-22 00:00:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love Dr. Peterson. He is very passionate about all of his classes. I have taken him before, but this class was by far my favorite. You create your own syllabus with the class, you choose what projects you want to do, and the atmosphere is very respected (even if there are proficiency differences). TAKE HIM FOR EVERYTHING IF YOU CAN!!!!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjI1NjQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1002","date_posted":"2021-12-17 00:22:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lots of homework, but seemed like a pretty easy grader and he was very responsive to email. You definitely have to put in effort and do the work, but if you do that, you should be fine. The online class is set up to where a lot of it is independent learning, but he's accessible if you need it. Not always a prompt grader, but gives helpful feedback.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTY2MjQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
