He provides resources for his students that help tremendously, that aren't required of him to give, and he PAYS FOR THEM himself. He goes above and beyond. Latin is hard, but he does a great job teaching it and is always available to help if you need it. Go to class, pay attention, and study the vocabulary words","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTM0NzI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITAL1001","date_posted":"2015-04-03 15:17:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very helpful, especially with the grammar. He has a pretty thick Italian accent and rarely deviates from the lessons in the book, he goes over the vocab and activities in class. If you need extra help, there is the FLRC, but he is willing to help. You need only ask and he will usually give you a time he is available.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTQxNDYz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
