There are a large number of assignments but I'm sure that's for all the Korean courses here at KSU. The assignments are very similar to what we had to do in KOR1001. LockDown Browser on all Lesson Tests and Midterm but not the quizzes. Strict with attendance.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDgxOTI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KOR1002","date_posted":"2020-06-03 05:25:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"The absolute best teacher I've ever had!! She's super caring and really wants the best for her students. During my online final, I was super nervous and at the end she told me I did well and she'd let me know if I needed to do extra credit for an A (but probably not). She's super accessible outside of class and will answer any questions!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNDAyNjY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KOR1002","date_posted":"2020-04-24 19:05:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great teacher! She's only been at KSU for a year now and she rocks! Only two group projects, some HW assignments, some quizzes here &amp; there &amp; 4 tests but they're easy if you study the material. A midterm and final exam but the study guide will help you immensely so use it.

Basically you'll have to memorize the 15-25 vocab words before each quiz which every time you'll have class. Plus you'll have three projects due. Two group and one by yourself. Other than the curriculum set up she's a wonderful professor","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTM1ODU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KOR1001","date_posted":"2019-11-12 19:27:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love Professor Cho, she is a good choice when starting learn Korean. Not only does she teach you based off of the textbook but she also teaches you everyday words. Professor Cho allows 2 absences, she takes attendance every class. She is very understanding and if you miss a day she'll allow you to retake the quizzes.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzk5NzMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
