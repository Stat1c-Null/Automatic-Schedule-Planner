Show up to her class, take good notes, and definitely practice your speaking! You have to learn how to be comfortable answering questions verbally naturally over the course of this class.

Final was a mess. 4 questions 3 had to be 45 seconds or more. All in one video. I understand she wanted us to improve our fluency, but was a little too harsh but I understand her intentions. Attendence and participation mandatory. 2 skits had to memorize script. overall decent and really nice","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDIxMjEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Accessible outside class--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KOR2002","date_posted":"2021-12-06 03:25:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Since it is a higher level course, there is more work/studying that goes into it. The lesson consisted of vocab quiz 1, vocab quiz 2, workbook/reading &amp; recording, and a test. So every class day something was &quot;due&quot;. You need to buy a whole new textbook &amp; pay for the online workbook. Mandatory attendance &amp; no late work accepted.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1Mzc3MjQz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
