She was smart, funny, easy to talk to.  She is an easier teacher than most, and does have sympathy for students with extenuating circumstances.

I love LOVE Ms. Clouse, she is the best teacher I have ever had in my life! No joke. Her class is much fun and she really knows Latin, she can pretty much speak it. She teaches so wonderfully, I took Latin in high school, but she easily taught me more than I knew. Take her class, even if just for the intellectual stimulation!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NTU2Mzcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
