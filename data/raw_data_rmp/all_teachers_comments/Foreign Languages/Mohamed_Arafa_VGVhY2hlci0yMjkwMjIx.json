He repeats himself a lot though. The use of the textbook is confusing, because he'll insist that you have it and bring it to class, but he'll only use it a few times during the semester.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMjkzMzY2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FL1001","date_posted":"2018-01-25 14:14:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loved his class! I would definitely take it over. The only complaint is we only had one quiz and no tests, so there was really no way to know if you were prepared for the final.

If you don't plan on coming, don't sign up for the class. Thick accent. Really likes when people participate and will occasionally call on you randomly. Homework every class, but he posts everything online and doesn't take much for a grade. Very tough class, but he tries to help every way he can. Pretty friendly.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NzgyOTc2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?
