He is very understanding and open. He grades very very leniently. He is funny and great to get along with.

The tests were fairly hard though and emphsized a lot of grammer concepts.  The Roleplays had to be done in the lab and with a partner.  My advice is to go in with a lot of questions, if you have any, on the review days before a test.  He is not very good with keeping his appointments in his office.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDIxMDcx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
