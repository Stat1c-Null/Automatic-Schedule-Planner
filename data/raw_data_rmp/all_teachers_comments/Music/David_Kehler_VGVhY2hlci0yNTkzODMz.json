The curriculum was broken into modules with video presentations, worksheets, discussion posts (focusing on our thoughts and opinions), and 2 quizzes. The professor provided genuine feedback and appreciated our music experiences and effort. This fast term was enjoyable!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzQ0NDg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2024-05-23 17:17:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"David Kehler is the professor to take!

I thought I'd be spending upwards of 3-4 hours a day on work, instead I got a whole days worth of work done in less then 2 hours. And if you mess up a discussion post, he leave feedback and allows redos.

I thought this class was going to be difficult, considering I know nothing about music and it was a may-mester. He was so easy to contact. The work was so easy, it probably took me an hour or 2 to finish it all, I made 100s on everything. The textbook was $60, but it was needed. Pick him if you get the chance you will not regret it","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3OTg5MTQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Accessible outside class--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2022-07-05 15:06:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class over the summer and was one of the easiest classes I have taken.

He gives very clear concise direction and his grading is straightforward and fair. You will need to purchase the book and you will have to do some writing in the class but it is not difficult.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMzIxMTUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
