It's a super easy class and he is so kind.

In fact, we had more classes canceled that actually in person. He also doesn't respond to his email and will post assignment submissions like right when they're do, so for those that work ahead it's not worth it. Great prof tho!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzkxNDQ0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2022-11-10 21:06:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Luke is AMAZING. Very chill. Only \"big\" assignments are 300-500 word concert reports. Covers modern (1890s and up) music history instead of older stuff, so it's fun. Does take attendance but it doesn't count for much of the grade. Honestly though, the lectures are so interesting that I'd recommend going to class anyway. Textbook isn't necessary.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODEzMjE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Hilarious--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
