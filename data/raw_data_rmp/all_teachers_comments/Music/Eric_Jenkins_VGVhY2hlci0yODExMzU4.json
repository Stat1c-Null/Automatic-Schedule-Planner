Lots of homework assignments and tests, and a few small papers and projects. A little more work than it should be as an elective for non music majors. However, Dr. Jenkins is very knowledgable and he cares about his students. If you really love music, his class is for you.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTUzMTQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lots of homework--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2022-12-06 05:00:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took the honors section of this class. there is a lot of homework but its not that hard. Dr. Jenkins is very passionate and knows a lot about the subject. If you do not know a lot about music you might struggle some but its very doable. Just annoying that its so much work for an elective class but thats unavoidable. Overall, its an easy A.

The textbook is very technical and the homework and quizzes are near impossible without a music background. Great prof tho!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzU5OTQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
