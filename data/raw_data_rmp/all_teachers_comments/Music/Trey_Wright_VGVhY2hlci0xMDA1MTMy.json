The reading is interesting - 14 weekly quizzes and discussions, three listening journals (2 albums each), a modern artist project, and two listening exams make up the grades. He grades quickly and pretty leniently. The listening exams were hard - I flunked both of them - but I made up for it with the extra credit.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDE5Nzc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI3314","date_posted":"2021-07-21 21:15:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is a great class and professor Wright is excellent. There were weekly quizzes based on the presentations, a few discussions and short papers, and a final project and exam. It sounds like a lot, but it really isnt that bad all assignments are quite straightfoward. Prof Wright will also respond to emails very quickly!

The workload could be a little heavy on some weeks, but most of the time it was okay. There were very few extra credit opportunities! We had 3 papers, 2 tests &amp; a project along with weekly assignments. Just don't procrastinate &amp; you should pass.

There's a group project. Listening homework is on Spotify and this is required! Several papers are assigned at a 3pg max on an album MLA. Tests are on material covered in class.

The lectures are boring but at least it is easy to catch up if you miss a day. You are allowed to miss 5 days.
