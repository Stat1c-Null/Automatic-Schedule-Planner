Gives out the right amount of work and nothing unnecessary. He plays trumpet and even shows us examples in person. I've never sat through a boring class. He also remembers the students individually/ if they know about music alr etc. Overall, great class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTU5NjAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
