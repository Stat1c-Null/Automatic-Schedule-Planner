He is very clearly passionate about what he does, but it almost seems like he doesn't respect that other people aren't as passionate about music than he is.

He does is grading so that it helps you in the end of the semester. He gives extra credit on tests and allows an extra credit concert. Only downside was the group project, make sure you pick good people. He is a great teacher.

He does not take into consideration that not everyone taking the class is interested in music. The tests and quizzes are super hard and the lectures are long and confusing.
