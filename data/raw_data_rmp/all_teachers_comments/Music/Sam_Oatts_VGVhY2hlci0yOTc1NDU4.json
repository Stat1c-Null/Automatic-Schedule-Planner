I would have questions and want to go to other teachers or students because of this. He was also not present for a chunk of the semester; he seemed to always be traveling to different schools or places to perform. Not too committed to the actual job.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODE3NjY5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
