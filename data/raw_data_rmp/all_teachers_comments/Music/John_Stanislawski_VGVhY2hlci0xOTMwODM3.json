You will have two papers to write but they are clearly laid out in the syllabus. There is some music listening that you will have to do. The songs  are on the tests. Overall, I really enjoyed the class and would definitely recommend it. If you have a chance, chat with Dr. S about music after class.

Over all he is a nice teacher and will try not to make the class boring, but this being his first class shows that he must listen to the students for feedback; and he does.  He takes the class quite seriously so this will not be an easy A. He is also VERY picky when it comes to discussions.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzOTQxMjM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
