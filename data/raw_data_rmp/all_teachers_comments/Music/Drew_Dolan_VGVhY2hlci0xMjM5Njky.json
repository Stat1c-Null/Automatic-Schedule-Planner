I took his course online and I was nervous about going into it. But, Mr. Dolan was great about any kind of help I may have needed. You will weekly quizzes online and 3 concerts you will have to go to, to write papers on. It is not a bird course, but the opportunity for an A is defintely there.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDY3OTQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2011-11-09 18:43:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took online.

Online and he is virtually a ghost, takes forever to grade. Worst part is for the online aspect is that it is VERY time restricting for an online course. Small window for online chat sessions and work due (if you work M-F/ 9-5 this is not the online class for you.
