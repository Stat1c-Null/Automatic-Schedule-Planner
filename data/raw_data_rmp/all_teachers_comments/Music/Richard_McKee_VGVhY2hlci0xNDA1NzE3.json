He seems to personally get the most out of the class when he believes that everybody is a beginner. He is very kind however and knowledgeable about the subject.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTg4NDQz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2020-04-30 14:11:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Music class is fun and you will learn a lot about the pedagogy as well as how to teach music lessons.

Great musician.  What other class can you sing children's songs, play the recorder, and teach kid dances?  So fun!  Not a ton of work, but you will learn a lot about music.

You will enjoy it!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzcxOTY2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2012-12-11 15:35:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice guy.
