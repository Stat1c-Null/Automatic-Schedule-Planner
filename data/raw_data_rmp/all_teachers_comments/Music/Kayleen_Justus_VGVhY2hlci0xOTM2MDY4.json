Her lectures are very dry and there isn't much discussion. I just sit there and rot while she talks and talks and talks. She's just really boring as a teacher. She reads off her powerpoint verbatim. I probably would't take her again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDI0OTYx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107","date_posted":"2014-12-08 21:42:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class to fulfill the art class requirement.

If not, she tells you exactly what you need to know (buy book for assignments). There are listening analysis for every unit and there is always one option she went over in class. Test are online. Lectures are dry and reads powerpoints word for word.
