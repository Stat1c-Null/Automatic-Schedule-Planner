One of the kindest, fairest, & encouraging teachers I've ever had the luck to make me work my tail off!  Never a dull moment, leads class thru various teaching methods & exercises.  She expects a lot, but in the end, you feel inspired. Class for future music teachers, so don't understand the rating comment of previous rater. &#63;&#63;&#63;","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNjM2NzQ=","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FAED","date_posted":"2004-06-20 20:40:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prepares you to teach, wonderful job","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjAyMzc=","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FAED","date_posted":"2004-06-19 10:49:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class as an Education course- she expects EVERYONE to be a music major.  Her expectations are very high, her work load is huge, and she makes you sing alone in front of your peers.
