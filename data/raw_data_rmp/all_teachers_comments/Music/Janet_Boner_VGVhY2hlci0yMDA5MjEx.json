Overall she's pretty cool. A little weird, but cool.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzI0NzIw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
