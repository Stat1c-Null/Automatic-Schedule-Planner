She is never rude or harsh and always professional and kind. She praises when praise is due and makes us feel very wanted. She gives helpful feedback so that we are always improving and able to put on an amazing performance.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDc4NzYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
