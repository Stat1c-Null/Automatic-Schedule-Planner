His attendance and grading policies are too aggressive.

He's so funny in class and picks exciting music for the group, though it's sometimes too hard for some musicians. I'm probably not going to take university band again just because of how late the class is, but I loved having his class and I'm excited to have him in marching band next semester!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTE2MDE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

Very funny and personable. Only thing I wish he would have done is cater the difficulty of the music a little better to the ability level of the class; some members of the band never seemed to get parts of the music.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzg1ODc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1141","date_posted":"2019-12-23 03:50:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"The key to getting an A is showing up. The music isn't difficult at all and it's just a really nice class in general. Dr. Scheivert is SO funny and is really understanding if you can't make it to a class.
