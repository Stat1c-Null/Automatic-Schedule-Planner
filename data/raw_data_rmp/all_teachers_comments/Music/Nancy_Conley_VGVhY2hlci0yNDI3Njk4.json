She is very last minute, unorganized, and we get nothing done at the end of the class. She wings every class and expect us to have assignments done that she posted last minute. She gets frustrated with the class when it is her fault from lack of planning.

She is so much fun and cares about each and one of her students. She makes class so much fun but at the same time pushes us to be a little bit each day. I would definitely take Dr. Conley again and again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzUyMDIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI3344","date_posted":"2021-01-08 01:46:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing instructor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjUxMjc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1144","date_posted":"2018-11-19 13:04:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor, very passionate and is a lot of fun.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzU1MTI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
