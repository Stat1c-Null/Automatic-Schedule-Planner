I came into this class with no piano experience and now I feel like I can continue on my own. The class itself is very straightforward, she's very lenient and more than happy to give you extra help.

WONDERFUL woman, and great teacher. I knew nothing about piano, and now I'm showing off to my friends my piano skills. Class is fun, but participation is mandatory so you MUST learn the homework she assigns. Lenient on attendance. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njk1ODAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1165","date_posted":"2020-12-18 15:39:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is an excellent pianist and an even better teacher.
