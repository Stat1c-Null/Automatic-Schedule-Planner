He goes over and beyond to make sure that you are a success in the class and he gives lots of chances! Honestly if you fail his class, your an idiot! Just go to class, participate whether it by email, class discussion and get a A!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDA0NjUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSIC1107","date_posted":"2012-11-15 14:00:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's an awesome teacher!:) Go to his class. You get 5 excused absences before you fail. He is very understanding and his tests are sooo easy! You don't really need the book but he occasionally refers to it in class. Awesome class, I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys music!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODQyNzMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1101","date_posted":"2012-10-11 22:48:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful teacher! He is very nice and passionate about what he is teaching. He is also very clear about what we need to do and what we need to know.
