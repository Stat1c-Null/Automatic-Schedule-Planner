He is efficient at the podium and makes good use of limited rehearsal time. He demands high standards without coming off as strict or scary. I have never seen him lose his cool. Great, open communication with section leaders and concertmaster. His replacement pales in comparison.

He is a great orchestra conductor who loves musical performance. Side note: MUSI 3344 and 1144 are Philharmonic Orchestra (for non-music majors). Main difference between 1144 & 3344: 3344 has 0 credit or 1 credit option (saves $ on tuition).","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDM2MjQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSIC1107","date_posted":"2009-04-27 22:57:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very very passionate about subject. You have to attend a ton of events though,some on your own dollar. Not the easiest professor to talk to either. I would still recommend him.

I found his lectures to be rather boring. He almost fell off the stage a few times and rambles. He takes attendance daily but allows you to miss up to five days. The 2nd & 3rd test cover a lot of material so it can be rather difficult to study.

He says he'll fail you if you miss or are late 5 classes, but if you ask he won't. Good class in & of itself, I suggest another professor - but he's not all bad, I think he bumped the last few points for me to get a B. Do the attendance things ASAP! He'll be more helpful then.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MTM0NDA4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSIC1107","date_posted":"2008-02-24 20:54:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"GREAT teacher.
