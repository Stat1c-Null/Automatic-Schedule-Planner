He explains things clearly in a way I can understand. The homework is normal, nothing too hard. He is clear about what is on the tests and what you need to study for. I highly recommend his class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODM2NDE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
