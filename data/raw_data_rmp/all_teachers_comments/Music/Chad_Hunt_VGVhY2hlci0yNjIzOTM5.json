He does have a lot of assignments, but from what Ive heard, no matter who you take the syllabus(I.e. the assignments) are the same. He is so caring and understanding and gives numerous opportunities to help improve your grade. He also offers tutoring outside of class!! Take him!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODQwMTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1112","date_posted":"2021-05-17 01:18:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was the best teacher ever.

Class grade depends on your own effort to study. Not helpful in class when teaching (he has tutoring on the side, though). Good person, but not the best music teacher.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njk1NzI4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MUSI1111","date_posted":"2020-12-18 15:35:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall I really enjoyed taking this course. He makes everything very clear and understandable and wants you to do well. He goes above and beyond and is happy to meet with you outside of class for extra help.
