Even after taking her class, she is still always there for me when I need her. Her class provided me with AMAZING ideas and activities that I have taken to the classroom. If I'm having a good or bad day teaching I can always call her for advice and I've been out of her class for a year!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDU5MTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3340","date_posted":"2015-06-30 08:50:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher is amazing. But please only go there if you're interested in music for your students. Too many came in without a care and it really hurt her since she's so passionate for bringing music in the classrooms. 1 test which was too easy and other assignments that were lesson plans but also easy and fun. She's amazing","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDA2NTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED","date_posted":"2015-05-06 09:00:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love Mrs. McKee!  Our class was always singing and moving.  She rarely lectures and teaches by having you experience music.  She always provides fast and positive feedback. As long as you pay attention and participate you'll succeed.

Let's you attempt lessons in class, which is fun. She does treat you as though you are about 10yrs old, but that's so you know what your students are going through.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzczODU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
