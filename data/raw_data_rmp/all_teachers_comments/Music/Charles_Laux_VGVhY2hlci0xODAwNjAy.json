He is very laid back, and if you email him ahead of time with a good excuse, he is very relaxed with attendance. But don't take advantage of that! You need to be in class to be prepared for concerts. He is a great conductor and is super nice and approachable! Take his class!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzIyODk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1144","date_posted":"2016-01-02 01:54:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"His class is pretty easy. He's a really cool dude and funny. As long as you show up for majority of the classes and all the performances you should be fine. It's impossible to fail unless you legit don't show up.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODU5MTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
