He doesn't discus the development or themes of a song. He also forgets what he's taught you already. The program is for concert composers, though he's trying to collab with other departments, but if you're into modern genres, KSU is not for you.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTYxMDk0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MUSI3316","date_posted":"2017-04-30 22:04:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was an easy A. I'm a com major and only took this course to fill In the gaps in my schedule. I wouldn't take this class again because he kind of comes off a bit racist. With a class of only 6, the majority being white and the other 2 being different races, he seemed to always have a non-related question about race. overall pretty decent","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTY4MDc4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MUSI3316","date_posted":"2012-11-14 14:55:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not the best professor.
