I took her for music 1107 and at the beginning of the year she said, \"this is a required course, so I'm making it as easy as possible.\" She's stayed true to her word - her tests are the same as the powerpoints and she gives a ton of extra credit that adds on to your tests and to your final grade in the class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzA4NzYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2014-12-10 22:57:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"The subject isn't that interesting, but she makes it entertaining.
