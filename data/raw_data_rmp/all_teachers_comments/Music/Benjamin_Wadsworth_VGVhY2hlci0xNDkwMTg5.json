He is not going to treat you unfairly, and you will succeed if you apply yourself. \nHe explains concepts in a concrete fashion primarily through verbalization, with small amounts of metaphors.

He is passionate about music, and knows how to work with students! Only two issues that are very minor: 1) He does not believe in 100's for homework (at the end of semester this can easily determine an A from a B) 2) Some of the COMP projects were advanced for an 1st year class . Other than that he is amazing!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODUxOTEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1121","date_posted":"2016-05-06 23:14:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is amazing.
