She has a lot of energy and expects you to give 100% effort, but she is never ugly about it. Had her for marching and concert band. In concert band she gets very annoyed when people use their phones, but I think that's fair.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NDA0MTE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1142","date_posted":"2021-12-09 08:34:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Ms Rudy for marching band, for her first year as an Assistant Band Director. Dr T and Ms Rudy are a great pair of teachers. I could tell they put in a lot of work to make our season great. Ms Rudy wrote our show drill and lead some of our practices. She is very approachable and kind.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDM1MjY4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
