The class was super easy if you do the work (which takes no time) and submit assignments on time. 95% of the battle was simply turning in the work on time. He was super understanding when difficult circumstances arose and helped me out big time when I needed it","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTYwNjA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IHS2100","date_posted":"2023-12-04 04:24:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice guy, but not a great professor. He doesn't put grades in during the semester (it is currently December and there is not a single grade in D2L). He also assigns a great deal of work towards the end of the semester, which isn't very beneficial for students. Attendance is mandatory.

He's has a lot of empathy and is willing to help out as much as he can due to grades. His class is very easy just stay on top of your work which you have about 2-3 weeks to finish each module.

Here is where Dr. Goldfine failed at being a teacher. He doesn't explain the material very well, and while I thought I was learning how to coach volleyball, I was learning how to play... again. He doesn't post grades, and he doesn't prep you for exams. Also, he doesn't care if his students are disruptive.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNDMxMzAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?
