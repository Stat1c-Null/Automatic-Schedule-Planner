I took her in the summer for 4 weeks, this class is super easy I made an high B and never studied. Didn't really use the text. Power points provide all you need.

There is some busy work, but it isn't much. You never use the textbook, so don't bother. The tests were all online. I got over a 100 in the class, because there is plenty of easy extra credit. She has an accent, but she is easy to understand.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTQwOTkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CUL2500","date_posted":"2014-04-08 11:17:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take this professor! This class is a breeze! Easy A! She's very sweet! She is very lenient as far as grading. A lot of busy work so make sure you do those.
