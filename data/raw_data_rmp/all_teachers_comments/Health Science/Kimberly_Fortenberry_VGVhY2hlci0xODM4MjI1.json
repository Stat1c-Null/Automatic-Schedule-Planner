I had a lot of questions going into the course, so I would email her. She would not respond for days, and it seemed like she had no idea what I was talking about, which made communication in this class horrible. Extra credit at the end is very misleading.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMTc0NDQx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2018-11-08 21:44:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"She not a good professor. The course itself wasn't hard, I would recommend taking this online, just pick a different instructor. She is not great about communication. The reason I got a B is because Bearface did not notify me that one of my assignments did not send. She was very rude when I asked about it, then just stopped replying to my emails.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjkwMzU1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2018-04-26 19:13:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Alooootttt of homework for an online wellness class. Everything is through the software BearFace. If you have a hard time managing your time, this might not be a class for you.
