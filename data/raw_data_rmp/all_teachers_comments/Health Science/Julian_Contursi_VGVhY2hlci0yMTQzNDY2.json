Not a lot of assignments & plenty of extra credit assignments. She's a very fair grader. She relates it to everyday life so its easier to understand. Go to class, pay attention, do the assignments and its an easy A. She's truly cares and is there to help. Textbook helps.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTUyMzY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
