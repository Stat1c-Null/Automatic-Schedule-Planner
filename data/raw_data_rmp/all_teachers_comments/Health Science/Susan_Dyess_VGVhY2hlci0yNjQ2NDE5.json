The lectures were a bit boring, but she is incredibly passionate about healthcare and helping to guide students in their career paths. Just make sure you read the text and the PowerPoints and youll do fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDY4MzYz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IHS2100","date_posted":"2020-12-02 21:02:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Four tests, answers were pretty much a give me. You will get an A if you attend classes, and probably a B if you dont. She did take attendance. Super easy resume assignment and website article assignment. Did use lockdown browser for tests taken outside of class, although most tests were inside of class. Boring lectures though.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTMwNDk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
