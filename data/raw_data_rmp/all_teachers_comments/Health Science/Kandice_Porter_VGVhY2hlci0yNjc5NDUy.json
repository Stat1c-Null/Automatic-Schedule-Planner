Idk weird situation but there were two professors and Porter was chill but other lady was strict on everything. The lectures were much better with Porter but the class should not have been an hour and fifteen minutes.

Her presence was definitely needed in this course, as it was taught by 4 professors and was very challenging in how the class was being conducted and structured. Lots of busy work, but thats more so because of the class structure, not Dr. Porter.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njc0OTI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
