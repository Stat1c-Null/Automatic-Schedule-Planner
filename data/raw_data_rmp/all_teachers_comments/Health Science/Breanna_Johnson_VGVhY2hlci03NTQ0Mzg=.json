You really don't need the professor but the times I did she never responded to emails and she never graded anything until weeks later. Other than that the class wasn't bad at all. Do all the assignments by the due date and you'll get an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjIxMDQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2018-12-12 18:29:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor was ok. She wasnt great at responding to emails, or giving feedback if you had questions. There are 6 modules that you must complete. You have about 2-3 weeks to complete each module. At the end of each module there is a quiz. My biggest advice to you is to have the chapter lessons open while taking the quizzes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTk0MzY4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2017-04-26 15:43:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great class to take online.

There are 3 or 4 assignments due each month that take maybe 10 minutes to complete tops. Very simple. Idk how she is in class, but online her class was a breeze. She was super understanding about late assignments too.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDg4MTAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2006-01-09 14:59:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Never ever take her.

It's pretty much everything you already know about health. No exercise= fat, etc. The tests are ridiculously complex,and it should be an easy &quot;A&quot; and for most people it is.
