Just simple assignments. Just kind of busy work, but it wont take more than an hour or so of your time every two weeks when everything for a module is due. You wont actually talk to professor at all. She wont answer emails anyway lol.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTMwMjk1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2019-05-25 19:24:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Would smash her textbook to the ground.

You get 2 free absences, and then it begins to count against you. She offers lots of extra credit. There are in-class participation activities that are generally not pre-announced, so try to attend.

The only thing I didn't like was that she took attendance when all of the assignments are online.
