The quizzes were tricky in my opinion, but the other assignments/activities are easy and help boost your grade. Can be an easy A if you just put in the work and don't slack off. Professor Liner was easily accessible by email for any questions I had.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODkzNjQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WEL1000","date_posted":"2019-05-02 20:35:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class has a lot of work, but it is divided by many different modules that give you more than enough time to complete it. I found the quizzes pretty hard, but my grade on those were balanced out with all the veryyyyy easy activities. Also there is no final!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzUwNjIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2019-04-17 19:29:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Participation alone will grant you an A. Pay attention to the guided readings because they directly relate to the quizzes, you only get one attempt and 60 minutes is not long enough to skim through several chapters for 30 questions. No final. The curriculum is very intriguing and great information for a realistic healthy lifestyle!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjE1MTQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2019-03-26 17:31:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"She uses Bearface not KSUD2L. This is alot of reading and you have to read the online modules to pass the quizzes which are sometimes slightly difficult. She responds to emails very quickly. No need to buy a textbook in this class it is online. It is a good amount of work, but it is by chunk. Alot of work due like three wks later versus everyday.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDgxNjc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Get ready to read","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2018-11-25 00:13:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best online class ever. All of the material was super easy to read and learn. The quizzes will be difficult to do if you don't read the chapters but you can use the textbook to help with quizzes. There's no final and the course ends earlier than normal in person classes. There's also an extra credit assignment at the end of the semester.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzc2MzA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2017-12-03 17:59:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easiest online class I've ever taken.
