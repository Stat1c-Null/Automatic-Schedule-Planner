He's interesting for the most part, but rarely smiles and can be hard to read at times. It's apparent he is incredibly passionate about cooking/eating/food. Good teacher. Easy class with only a midterm and a final exam.

The only huge problem I had with him is that he did not post any grades on d2l. I had no idea what I had in the class the entire semester. Even at the end I had no clue what I made on his assignments. There were also so many assignments. Journals, presentations, vocab. You really have to love culinary to enjoy him","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODkwNTIw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2200","date_posted":"2015-04-19 12:33:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Chef Costa is really nice, but.. I took this class because it was advertised as an elective... not the case at all! It's a major class for culinary students. You have to do group power point presentations almost every week, write food journals every week,  quizzes every week, two tests, and two long papers. In other words, don't take this for fun.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NjIzMDYw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2300","date_posted":"2014-07-17 23:48:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Passionate about what he teaches, and is always willing to seek out any answer he doesn't know off the top of his head. Excellent instructor, I really liked his teaching style. He occasionally moves quickly, but usually covers the important material more than once before the end of the semester. Overall I'd highly recommend taking him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDU0MTYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2300","date_posted":"2014-05-12 13:08:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Chef Costa is very passionate about what he does. As long as you attend class and practice the skills he teaches you outside of class, you will get a good grade. Attendance in mandatory as lab participation is 50% of your grade. Sometimes he moves a little fast through the material, so you always have to pay attention.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjI1OTU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
