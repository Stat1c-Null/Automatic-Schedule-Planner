She is incredibly caring and knows a lot about the subject she's teaching. She's always willing to help her students, you only struggle in the class if you don't do your work and don't pay attention. She is really late at grading stuff which sucks.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjczODQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHE2400","date_posted":"2020-05-03 06:47:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"WORST professor EVER! Dr. Ukuku wasn't specific in her instructions on assignments. She taught this course on a 4000+ level. She lectures HEAVY so be prepared to read. She's very disorganized. She's a last minute grader. She doesn't follow her syllabus. I would NOT recommend taking her if you care about your GPA.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTg3OTQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHE1101","date_posted":"2020-05-01 20:44:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"TERRIBLE! This class stressed me out with the overwhelming amount of work we had to do for LITTLE POINTS . Felt like I was taking a doctoral course. The class lacked structure and guidance. Her instructions were confusing and misleading. The test are hard to pass every question required an essay response.

She provides you with 2 pages of instructions and ends up changing the assignment right before its due. Her class was horrible, she is disorganized, late grader, and doesnt not provide feedback that is useful.
