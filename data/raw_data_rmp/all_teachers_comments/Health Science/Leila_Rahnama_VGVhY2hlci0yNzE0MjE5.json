After the first half, Dr. Rahnama adjusted the material to better reflect what her students would benefit from knowing as non-med students. She really appears to want her students to do well.

She rarely took constructive criticism on the course content either, which was extremely disheartening as I really did work hard in the class.

There are only 3 big assignments and her grading criteria is super confusing. She does not know how to use d2L and her syllabus does not line up with due dates on d2l. She does email back in a timely matter but she often ignores your questions.
