There was a total of 5 exams and quizzes along the way. Make sure to study and ask questions! She will ALWAYS help you. She is very understanding. When I was down in a slump she talked to me and encouraged me that everything is going to be okay","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDUxOTU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Test heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2222","date_posted":"2021-12-09 19:21:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Smith is the best. Her lectures are very informative and if you don't understand a certain topic, she doesn't hesitate to help. As long as you attend lectures, put in the work (study), and take advantage of given resources, you'll do great! Overall, 10/10 would recommend!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDQxOTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2222","date_posted":"2021-12-09 18:18:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely adored this teacher. She makes concepts so easy to understand, she takes the time to stop during lectures and fourth break things down. Test come straight from PowerPoint, no trick questions. She even adjusted the tests to what style of questions we like (like T o F, matching, ect). She really WANTs you to succeed.

If you are taking Anatomy, take her! She is a new grad, but it feels like she's been teaching for years! She is very caring, relatable, funny, ORGANIZED, and super quick to grade. She gives lots of extra credit as well. Exams come directly from her power points. Didn't read the textbook once (only for homework).","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDE4Mjc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
