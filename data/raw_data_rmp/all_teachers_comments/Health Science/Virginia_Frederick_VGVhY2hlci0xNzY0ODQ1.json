She is so clear, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable about this course. On top of that, she gives 100% everyday and has a bright and positive attitude.

She is so nice and has such a kind heart.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzA0Mzc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES2100","date_posted":"2017-04-27 20:50:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Frederick is pretty easy, she doesn't ask for much. But she does like to give random quizzes called retrieval practices. SHE DOESN'T LET YOU GO BACK TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS ON QUIZZES OR TESTS. That's the only major problem. The class is kinda boring and if you don't want to go just make sure to look over the powerpoints to catch up a little bit.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTQ4MjY4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ES2500","date_posted":"2016-05-08 14:10:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Let's be real here.  She has a deep passion for this course and goes into specific detail into every little fact.  Her lectures are super long because she talks the ENTIRE, and I mean ENTIRE time.  All of her students zone out. But she is helpful, nice and young.  Class is so easy if you do all your work and study for tests.  A lot of common sense.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTA0MTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2015-11-30 14:59:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"CLASS TAKEN: Wellness  LECTURES: Lots of reading on each chapter.

Lots of work but she gives about 2 weeks per chapter so...you have time. Does not take late work so, get it done! She also curves. I ended up with a 88.6% in the class....but got a 90% (A). Thanks.

She grades very fairly. However there is large workload and you will need to read each chapter in the ebook to pass the tests. There are a few discussions and projects throughout. CTQs, labs, and a test are the main things in each module.
