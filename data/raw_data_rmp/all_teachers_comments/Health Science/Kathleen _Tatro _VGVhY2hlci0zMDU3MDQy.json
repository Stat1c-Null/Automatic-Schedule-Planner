I believe its the same metric you can see if you go into d2l and go to (other) -> (class progress). But it does seem like she actually likes talking about mHealth.

She put in one grade from January and didn't put in anymore grades until after spring break. I appreciate the detailed feedback, but the harsh grading is unnecessary if we don't have it prior to the following assignment on the same topic.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjA3NDcz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IHS4445","date_posted":"2025-04-28 15:03:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Tatro was a really sweet she knows a lot and is helpful when you need it.

The lecture portion of class is not engaging, and the second half is spent doing different worksheets, rephrasing the same material you and your group have discussed all semester.

She provided little guidance, rarely gave feedback on time, and seemed disengaged. The group format didn't enhance learning&#8212;just shifted the workload.

This class had LOTS of group work. The only negative about her is she takes forever to grade things. The whole semester, you work on a project about a health issue of your choosing, and she works with you to make sure you succeed. She also gives extra credit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTgwMzQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
