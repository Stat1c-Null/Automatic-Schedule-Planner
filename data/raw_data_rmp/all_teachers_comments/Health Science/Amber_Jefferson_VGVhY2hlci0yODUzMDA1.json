There were chapter quizzes (14, almost weekly), 7 short writing assignments (at least 1 page), a few longer writing assignments, and two exams (no webcam).

The Health class I took with her was great. It was all online and very independent and self-paced. Her instructions were very clear. I don't think I had to email her a single time with a question.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTM0OTU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
