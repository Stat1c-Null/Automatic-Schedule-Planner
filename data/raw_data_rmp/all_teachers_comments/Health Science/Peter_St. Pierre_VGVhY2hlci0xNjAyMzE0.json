Class was mostly lecture with some labs. Reinforces what you need to know. I thought some of the labs were kinda hard to write up but as long as you do it you get full credit. His test are a bit hard; they are mostly short answer, but his study guides cover everything you need to know. Nice guy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTQyMjg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1560","date_posted":"2016-07-07 21:17:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"By far my favorite professor at KSU!
