Coach can be reserved at first but once you get to know him he is awesome. 3 take home quizzes and a final over those 3 quizzes and a skills test at the end. Super easy and I enjoyed it a lot. He knows what he is doing!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzEzNDA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1390","date_posted":"2021-06-02 00:41:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tough class on the physical side, but truly an easy credit. Easy A, pretty sure everybody got an A+ He knows what he's doing and if you want to improve in tennis quickly this is a good choice. Had 3 easy quizzes, a midterm, and a final all written then a practical skills test which even our worst players passed.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODgxODg0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1395","date_posted":"2017-12-01 12:55:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Show up to all the classes and you will pass. He give super easy quizzes. and the finals is easy. But you must know he has a nasty attitude and sometime disrespectful.

Only grades are 3 tests, a midterm, and a final written and a practical exam. No homework (besides practicing, of course) and no book. The final practical was a little wonky, but if you study the handouts and at least know how to explain what you're supposed to be doing, you'll be fine. :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTIxMzg1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
