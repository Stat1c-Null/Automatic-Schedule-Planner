He read straight from the book. I fell asleep almost every class. Impossible quizzes after every chapter only 5 questions, you'll fail most of them. The study guides he hands out before tests help a little. Get out of every class early, at the least 20 minutes, at the most 45 minutes. 6 hrs of activity and labs bring up grade.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MTg3NzEz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2008-12-11 09:09:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is useless. he reads directly from the book. and doesn't fully explain the exercises that he wants us to do. he seems to think that everyone is in good physical condition and expects everyone to be able to perform at the same level.

Not a bad teacher but a really fair teacher. Do what you're supposed to and its an easy A. (The 6 activity hrs were actually fun.)

His lectures are  broad, which make the tests broad. &quot;Activity Days&quot; are a must, as well as different projects throughout the semester.
