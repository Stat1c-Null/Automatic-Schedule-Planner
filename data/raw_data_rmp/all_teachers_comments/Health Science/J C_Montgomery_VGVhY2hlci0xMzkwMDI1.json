He won't let you in if you arrive even a minute late but attendance isn't mandatory anyway. You do short \"labs\" with the online textbook but they usually take less than 5 minutes. Take him, it's easy and if you follow the syllabus you don't need to come to class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDIwNDAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2012-11-15 09:08:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is so easy. I mean it is HPS, how hard could it be?

He gives you a study guide before exam.  Labs are just participation grade.  You use the HPS online textbook so you kinda have to purchase it (because the labs are in there).
