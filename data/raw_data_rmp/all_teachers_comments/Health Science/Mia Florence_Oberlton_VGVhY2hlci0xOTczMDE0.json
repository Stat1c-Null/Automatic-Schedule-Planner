Every assignment is taken completely seriously, and you must participate in all fitness assignments. These assignments were hours upon hours worth of going to the gym and doing pointless activities that have nothing to do with my major. If you're hardcore into fitness, this is the professor for you.

I took her WELL 1000 hybrid class which was super easy. No tests or quizzes. All work is online except a few pop ticket-in-the-doors. She explains every step for every assignment. She gives easy extra credit. There's no final! I would definitely recommend her and would take her again in a heart beat.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzAzMTE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2015-10-18 17:40:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a really nice teacher.

However, after taking Dr. Oberlton's course, all of that changed. I took her hybrid class. There are no \"paper\" finals. But u will have quizzes to take. You NEED the book!

Dr. Oberlton was a great teacher. She's super helpful and very nice. She doesn't require you to come to class, however she told us at the beginning of the semester that if you miss 4 classes you will fail (especially if we're doing a labphysical activity that day).
