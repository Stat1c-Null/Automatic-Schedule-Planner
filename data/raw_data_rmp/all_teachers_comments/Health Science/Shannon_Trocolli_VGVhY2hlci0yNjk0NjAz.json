Easy material, just a lot of busy work. Assignments are due every 2 weeks, and if you miss it you cannot get any points for turning it in late. She offers multiple opportunities for extra credit though.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzE0MjQy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL2000","date_posted":"2024-03-25 19:12:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Troccoli is extremely helpful in this course. She uses a different platform from D2L but it looks the exact same and is super easy to navigate. No tests, just end of unit review sheets and there are quizzes but they are open note no lockdown.
