There are 6 modules and no final. Each module had quizzes which you could look through the notes for answers. Even though I did not get super good quiz grades, I still got an A. He offers extra credit opportunities as well. 100%recommend!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzAxNTQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2018-03-29 22:59:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"This has been the worst experience for me. Professor Turchan does not give good feedback at all. took him 3 days to answer an email about an assignment that was locked by bearface and when he finally answered I tried to complete the assignment he put it in as a 0 even though the email was sent before the due date. easy assignments but beware","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NzE3NTQ3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2017-05-06 00:49:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really like Turchan,but I hated wellness using Bear face online platform. I guess it's unfair to weigh that into part of his rating, but if you take the HYBRID, it's annoying. I don't recommend taking Wellness online. The final and midterm were nit picky questions that aren't really relevant to wellness to begin with. He's cool but wellness sucks","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjI5NTAz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2016-12-11 16:29:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Seriously the best. Easy class, for the attendance policy can only miss 2 days, gives extra credit towards the end of class and sends out reminders by email before assignments are due. Does not accept late work! One of the nicest professors I have taken so far and really cares about what he's teaching.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDMzMjI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2016-05-07 00:37:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hes not really open to helping you. What he writes in the syllabus is what happens. If it says due at 12:00 and you turn it in at 12:01, no discussion it is a zero. A dumb class to take online, take in person if you can.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDk1OTIx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2015-12-15 08:12:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Coach Turchan is an awesome down to earth guy who's willing to help and put in efforts to actual put some value in all the textbook stuff the online textbook is trying to cram into you.

I wish I could take him for all my health classes.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTc2NjI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
