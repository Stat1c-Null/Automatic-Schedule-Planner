Tardiness counts too- 3 tardies= one absence. Emily is very nice and funny but the attendance grade part sucked.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzE2NDIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"YOGA101","date_posted":"2022-04-26 20:50:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"the class actually made me like yoga & as a person this professor is pretty nice. but if youre like me and dont have much motivation to get up and actually go to class i wouldnt recommend it. its easy to fall behind without noticing and she doesnt really care about making up attendance until the end when its too late. i loved the class though","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTYxMzIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1480","date_posted":"2021-10-15 16:37:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Berreth is a GREAT choice for intro yoga! She tries to make the class engaging. Participation is the majority of grade. Miss 1 class for no penalty, miss 5 and you fail. Makes sense tho since its yoga. Weekly journal assignments that are easy, occasional discussion posts. Big assignment at end of the semester and a final.

There is a journal you have to keep up with throughout the semester and a final exam, but neither are difficult.
