Even if you do well on the test, he kinda gives you a grade he feels you deserve. Rips apart anything that is a written response. I got 80 pus on exams, A and group prject and still ended up with a C! But he tells you to trust the process.

He's big on participation and there are plenty of extra credits. His lectures are easy to follow and he gives hints on what's on tests. He does value his time because he left a lecture when no one watched a video before class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTk5OTg1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
