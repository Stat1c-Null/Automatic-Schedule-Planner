Lots of hands on experience at the farm, which helps get the concepts across. I love that he is always ready to go above and beyond to help you understand or get more knowledge in your areas of interest. Probably my favorite teacher to date.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDU0MTY2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH3500","date_posted":"2014-04-27 01:37:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"AWESOME TEACHER! Super nice and understanding, approachable. Really loves what he is doing. The class itself is fairly easy, you have to read a few chapters every other week or so and take quizzes.
