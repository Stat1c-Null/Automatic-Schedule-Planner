She is fun and personable despite being online. Super applicable and interesting topics. No extra credit and exams are a little hard but if you apply yourself you can easily make an A. Very fun diet analysis assignment at the end of semester too was cool! I recommend!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjkyOTQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NUTR2100","date_posted":"2020-03-09 03:51:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her quizzes are VERY specific and fairly challenging. She assigns a lot of homework assignments- most of which are not that helpful. The quizzes are 25 questions long and she only gives you 20 minutes to complete them. I didn't find her online lectures to be very helpful either. I was hoping for more out of this nutrition class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTYwNTQ5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSH2500","date_posted":"2018-05-02 20:08:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Beebe is so sweet and very easy to communicate with. She takes random attendance so make sure you're there every class. Her classes are boring as she just reads from the powerpoint despite being very knowledgable about the subject. The tests are kind of hard but just make sure you know the material. The quizzes and homework help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTY1Mzk3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
