Attendance was a grade but really useful class. She responds to emails quickly & is willing to help out with anything you may need. She taught us about skills needed to get a job and brought in guest speakers! She gave great resources as well. Take her!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDM3NTM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IHS1000","date_posted":"2024-04-21 22:35:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved her! Quizzes and tests were super easy and open note, usually common knowledge and she gives you everything you need to know. Attendance is mandatory, but I took her in person class and every class was fun and you learned a lot especially, if you are an IHS major. Overall one of my favorite and easiest classes I've taken so far at KSU.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjIyMTQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
