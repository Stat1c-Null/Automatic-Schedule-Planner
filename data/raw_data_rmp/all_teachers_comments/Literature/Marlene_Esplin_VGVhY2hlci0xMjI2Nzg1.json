You will have to read a book every week,then come to class and discus about the book. There are 2 tests,a presentation,a rough draft,a final draft,and rush writes at the beginning of each class. It's not hard to make an a. You just have to put some effort into the class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDUzOTgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2012-12-07 06:07:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome teacher.

Class is very easy if you read the books and attend class. Tests were long but not really hard, and there are only 2, a midterm and a final. Also assigns a paper and a short presentation. Tries to make the class interesting and encourage discussion. An all around great professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzIwODM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
