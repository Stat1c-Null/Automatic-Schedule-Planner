She's opinionated but she listens to her students AS LONG AS THEY'RE RESPECTFUL! Be sure to read because if you don't, she will assign pop quizzes. The only issue I had was that she didn't give very good feedback on essays. But once I asked, she did.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODg2NzQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3340","date_posted":"2015-11-05 21:42:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Walkiewicz is a wonderful professor and I highly recommend her! She gets to know her students and is able to connect well with us. There's occasional very short pop quizzes, but as long as you have done the assigned reading, then you'll do just fine in her class. Always do the reading! She's my favorite professor and I really enjoy this class!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzU1MDk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3340","date_posted":"2015-08-12 01:15:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is probably one of the best English professors I have ever had, and as an English Ed major I have had a great many. Our class was pure discussion and papers. We would read a section of the assigned work then discuss it the next day in class. She values the opinions of her students and encourages critical thinking.

It is a scam. She is extremely mean. She will make fun of students who do not read.  Do not take. I repeat. Requires attendance or she will fail you. Her class is so mindnumpingly boring it physically hurts. Keeps you till the last second of every class. Have fun with the pop quizzes!
