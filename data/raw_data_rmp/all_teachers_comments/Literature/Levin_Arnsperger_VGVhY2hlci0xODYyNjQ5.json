His grading is fair if you come to class and do the work. There are online quizzes every week, a mid term, a project and final. He requires attendance but allows up to five absences without penalty. I highly recommend him!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjgzMzc3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2014-01-09 15:05:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"EXTREMELY nice professor! Lots of reading required, with journals due twice during the semester. He offers as much help as you need during his office hours. His biggest pet peeve is that he wants respect, and wants the students to actually participate. The midterm and final consist of HEAVY writing assignments. Would take him again. And he's hot.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzI2MjE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2013-12-11 17:14:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Levin Arnsperger is awesome! He makes it very clear what is expected and grades easily. Lot of reading required, but he discusses each text in detail so you can't fall behind. 2 tests, all essay based, but as long as you pay attention in class you'll be fine. In-class discussions are mandatory, so be aware! He cares very about each students success","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTExMTAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2013-12-11 05:36:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Arnsperger was completely fair. Heavy reading is involved. Grades consist of participation, midterm & final, reading journal, and presentation. Grading was very fair and he provides feedback. Overall satisfied with the professor. Tests are 100% essay based. Quick to respond to emails and extremely approachable. Would definitely take him again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTAzNTcx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2013-12-10 22:30:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was difficult for me simply because of the subject matter.
