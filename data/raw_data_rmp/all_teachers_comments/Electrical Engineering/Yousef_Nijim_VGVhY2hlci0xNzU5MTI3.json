He tries to explain the difficult material in an easy to understand way, and understands what is or what isn't too difficult for an exam. He really cares about the students and will curve if he feels it is necessary. Attending the lectures is a must as the test material comes right out of them","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTAxMjA2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE3702","date_posted":"2019-05-01 11:49:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"He lectures alot but curve 2 of the 3 test. he gives alot of extra credit.

All notes are taken in class, so class is very important. Homework is given to you on the board and you have to copy it down. He is very nice and gives fair tests.

His notes are a bit difficult to read at first but you get used to it. learn to write quickly and listen at the same time and you'll get the most out of his class.
