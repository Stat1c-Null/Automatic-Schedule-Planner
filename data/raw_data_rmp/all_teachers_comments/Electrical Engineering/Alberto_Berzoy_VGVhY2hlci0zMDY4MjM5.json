The midterm, final, and quizzes are insanely difficult, lectures are confusing and hard to follow with few example problems worked out, and the labs and homework are graded harshly.

Nice guy but not good professor. Quizzes were terrible, he had us physically write a bunch of Matlab code on earlier quizzes. Labs weren't that bad. Harsh grader. Pulls his questions from textbook.

Class is a hot mess, super difficult quizzes that aren't even taken during lecture time. The class severely lacks structure, he has never taught lecture before and is a tough grader. He is part time with no office hours and there is literally zero tutoring at KSU for this course, good luck!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNjQzODI2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE4201","date_posted":"2025-02-05 06:16:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"quizzes are insanely hard, he expects us to memorize the syntax for matlab, cool guy but sucks at teaching.

Assignments, lectures, etc. are often unclear and iterated upon 5+ times including completely being changed. Lectures are poorly organized and quizzes are taken outside of class hours.

Graded the labs inconsistently and harshly. After numerous complaints and Hai Ho having to have a talk with him, it improved.\n\nWas very lenient about regrading and extending the due date of labs though. I just wish he didn't grade us like grad students. \n\nI pity those who will take him for lecture.
