He is a good lecturer and explains everything we need to know clearly, without spending time on unnecessary topics. I felt like every minute spent in class was a productive one. He is helpful outside of class and gives lots of opportunities to improve grades. Not only that, he is a decent, well-rounded person in general.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTUxMDUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE6650","date_posted":"2024-08-18 07:56:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took 6650. HW & Tests were challenging & lengthy. You have a full day to work on the Test (open book). He does curve grades & drops the lowest scores, giving students a chance to raise their grades. Which is great! Lectures were good. There were 7 homework assignments, f6 quizzes, 3 Tests, & a Final Exam.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Njg5NzMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE6650","date_posted":"2024-08-13 23:07:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"A prof. that wants you to learn/succeed in a topic that he is clearly passionate & knowledgeable about. Pay attention to the lectures (they are easy to listen to), complete the HW/quizzes and you are guaranteed to do well on the tests.

Throughout the semester, it made me learn to actually be a better student from how he gives out his quizzes, homeworks and prelabs, which are usually due on sundays. He grades fair, if you don't do what is due, you don't get the grade period.
