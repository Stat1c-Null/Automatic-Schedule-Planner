Have to show up, he takes roll. Teaches DIRECTLY from the book. Literally projects the examples on the wall and reads them out loud. Learn to teach yourself. Join IEEE or have friend in IEEE to get his old tests from Test Bank and you'll make an A easily. Tests can be tricky sometimes... Lets you use 8X11 formula sheet.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzOTM0MDIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECET2110","date_posted":"2006-12-07 02:52:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"No Comments","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNTM5NzY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CIRCUITS12","date_posted":"2006-05-11 00:36:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ok, he isnt hard, but incredibly boring.  I mean counting ceiling tiles boring.  I mean you'll buy games for your cell phone during his class.  He knows his stuff allright, he's smart, but he's very slow, and very boring.  If you can handle the snooze-fest and actually pay attention, you'll do good.  He lets you have 1 page of formulas each test","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExODY2MDM2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
