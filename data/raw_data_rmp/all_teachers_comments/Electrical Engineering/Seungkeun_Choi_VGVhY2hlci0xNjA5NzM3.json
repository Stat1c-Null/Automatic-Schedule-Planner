He gave us a worksheet TWO DAYS before the test and I couldn't do it and didn't have time to seek help.  Failed the first test with a 10/100 and withdrew that day.  I'm a 4.0 student.  If you want a teacher, take someone else.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDYwNjY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE2301","date_posted":"2012-01-03 22:29:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"The professor is brand new to teaching. His first semester was great. Tests were hard but you can get through them. He is very helpful, and will set up office hours whenever you want. You will learn alot in his class. EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NjYyOTkz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE2301","date_posted":"2011-10-21 23:54:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not a bad prof. He started the semester off in high speed flying through the material then slowed down and reviewed for awhile in the middle of the semester. Just be ready for his test, they are difficult!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MDkzOTQ4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
