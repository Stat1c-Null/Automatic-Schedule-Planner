Need quite a bit of time for homework, but the more you understand the homework, the easier the tests will be.

He teaches at a pretty rapid pace but does a great job pulling it all togehter. His labs are about you learning not spending hours on formal presentation. DO THE HOMEWORK! If you can do it, the tests are not that hard. He is very fair in his grading and very helpful as well. If you miss a class you are way behind.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MDIzNzE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECET2300","date_posted":"2009-08-25 11:45:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher. His lectures were so great I barely used the book, except for homework. Very helpful explaining the material in and out of class. Had him for Fundamentals and Electronics 1.

You must do homework and complete labs to get full credit. Allows 8.5x11 sheet on tests and gives lots of partial credit. Had him for fundamentals and Electronics 1.

Knows his stuff, but can get his examples mixed up a bit in lectures. Likes &quot;design&quot; and applied &#63;'s on his test. Some &#63;'s on test gave impossible answers, but he gave credit anyways. Allows 3x5notecard on tests. Review his lectures/example to do well on tests. Not too heavy on book, but use to study example.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NTc4NjYx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECET2300","date_posted":"2007-11-11 10:15:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"No Comments","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNjMyOTY4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
