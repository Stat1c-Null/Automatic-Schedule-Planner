I'm a recent graduate, had 3 classes with him last Fall. Dr. Ma was very professional and knowledgeable in his field. On top of that, he's very honest, helpful and is really a good person for consulting. He guided and advised me for my graduate program and helped me a lot.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTc1ODM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE3501","date_posted":"2013-12-14 14:44:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Ma is one of the best teachers at SPSU. He knows what he is talking about and he is ALWAYS available in his office to help students. He doesn't waste class time answering stupid questions. His classes are hard, but you will actually learn something. Watch out for trick exam questions in 3501... Sometimes he puts intentional errors in the code.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTUzMDAx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE3501","date_posted":"2013-07-09 11:08:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a really good teacher, he is available for questions and whenever you need him.
