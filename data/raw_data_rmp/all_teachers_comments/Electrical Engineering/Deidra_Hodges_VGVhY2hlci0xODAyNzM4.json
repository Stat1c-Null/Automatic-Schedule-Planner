Beside her great and comprehensible teaching style, Dr. Hodges is absolutely one of the nicest ladies I have ever met in my life. She cares about your learning much more than your grades, very helpful inside and outside of the class, even when you're done with her course, you can still ask her for help. In 1 word, SHE'S PERFECT!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjM1OTYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Pass","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE2401","date_posted":"2013-07-15 12:57:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hands down this is the best teacher in engineering PERIOD.
