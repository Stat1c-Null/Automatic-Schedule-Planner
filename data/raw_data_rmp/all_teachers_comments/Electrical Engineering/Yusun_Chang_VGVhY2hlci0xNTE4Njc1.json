The material is hard to grasp just by reading a book and he always goes over examples while he is lecturing and often engages the class by asking them questions. He has been teaching for many years and his labs are very fun. Very little homework is assigned and offers at least 2 practice tests per exam.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDQ1MzY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE2501","date_posted":"2019-10-22 10:03:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Chang will constantly remind you that he's in charge of logic design and WILL fail you which makes it all the more disappointing that he's a terrible professor. Just walks out on his lab section and punts it all on the TA because he has better things to do? Canceled the last class before a major exam early rather than review.

For any EE majors at KSU, he is one of the best to teach Digital Logic Design. He is a hard professor, but it is rewarding. If you skip class, you will basically fail by missing out on important information. It all builds on each other so DONT skip.
