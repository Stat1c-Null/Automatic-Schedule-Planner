Rarely if ever offers any his own personal knowledge. Note-taking is very hard. Test criteria is unclear. Study the wrong thing and you will not pass.

His class is like a hardware design bootcamp. But like bootcamp you will get through it if you enjoy the subject matter, want to learn, and are not lazy.

He does not give any partial credit and will dock points off homework and tests for eraser marks.  Also his tests are nothing like the homework.
