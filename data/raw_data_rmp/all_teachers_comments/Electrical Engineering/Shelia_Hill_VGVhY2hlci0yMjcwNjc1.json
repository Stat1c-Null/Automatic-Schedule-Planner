She is well organized, tech-savvy, and a great explainer. She takes great care to make sure everyone in her class can succeed. The course material is easy to follow and understand and requires minimal effort if you understand the content.

She teaches well, and is ready to answer any questions. She WANTS EVERYONE to do GREAT so she grades very lenient and fair. She posts everything on D2l so it is okay if you miss class. Her reviews are extremely relevant to the tests. She lets you exempt the final if you do well!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDIwOTIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
