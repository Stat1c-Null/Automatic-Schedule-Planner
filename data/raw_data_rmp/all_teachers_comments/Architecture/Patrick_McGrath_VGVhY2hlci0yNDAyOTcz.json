Mr. McGrath knows this and works with you. If you ask him for help he will help direct you but in the end you decide what you want to do. He is one of the easier professors for studio while still being difficult.

He critiques your work in a way that makes you think outside the box to help you improve. If you are willing to put forth the effort in your work then this is the professor for you. Some students expected this to be a walk in the park, were rude, hardly attended and expected an A.

In my class we had two people who barely showed up to class and when one of them did show up, she complained the whole time. Ryan gives good feedback and hes relatively fair when it comes to grading.

He doesnt understand the concept of studio. He will give you overwhelming assignments and you will have to do them at home because he literally spends the entire 4 hours going around judging work.
