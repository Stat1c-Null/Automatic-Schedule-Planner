He expects a lot, but it's because he wants to make you better. He will push you when you need to be pushed and he will lay off when he sees your passionate about spending time with your design. If you respect his level of passion for architecture, you will succeed.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjkxNjE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH3012","date_posted":"2018-04-30 15:06:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Heavy course load in studio, but focused in areas that don't apply to final deliverables. Highly knowledgeable, but can be a bit condescending. He is helpful in desk critiques, but in reviews brings up issues that he didn't address beforehand. Focuses heavily on surrounding area, leaving little time for actual building development.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTM1Mjc5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

He does play favoritism, and clings on to a \"favorite\" student and treats them differently from the rest of the class. Overall you'll learn a lot, and his studio was extremely hard but helpful.

He ironically propagates a corporate capitalistic teaching model (with endless work and soul-crushing reviews) while preaching sustainability and green practices.
