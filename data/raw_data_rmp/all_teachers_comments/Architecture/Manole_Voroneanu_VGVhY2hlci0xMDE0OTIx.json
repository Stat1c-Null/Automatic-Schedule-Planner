Good at helping students individually on their projects. Really gets you to think outside the box which is important in design foundation courses. The ONLY downfall I had with the corse is he takes a long time to return grades on projects, but I do feel like he grades fairly and thats all that matters.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NzI2MDcy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1001","date_posted":"2011-05-31 12:36:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Manole for my first semester of design and I really liked his concept of architecture.
