I have had him for many classes and he is very passionate with his work. If you are going into second year I would recommend taking him, you will learn a lot.

I spent so much time on my projects, fives everything he gave feedback on and still got a B.

He connects with his students easily and is a very genuine teacher who cares about subject matter and students. Has a great sense of humor and makes class stress free. Quizzes and tests are tough but fair. Doesn't focus on grades rather his goal is for you to gain understanding. Would highly recommend and take again!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTgyMTU4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH2003","date_posted":"2014-07-24 11:02:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very helpful. Extremely nice, (treats you like one of his own) Makes you feel like if you work hard enough at you're idea will work. But he still gives you a lot of work and expects greatness.  Isn't nagging at all and trust that you can get your work under control. He even allots you the first 2 hrs of class to complete unfinished work.
