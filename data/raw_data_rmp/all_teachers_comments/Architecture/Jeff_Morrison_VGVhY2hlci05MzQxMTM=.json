Cocky. Doesn't show interest in being in class and is always checking his phone...rude. Doesn't have an imagination. Never understands students' work unless it's a box. Hence lack of imagination. If you're into simple designs go for it. If you like complex ideas... he is absolutely no help.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MTUyNTY4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1002","date_posted":"2007-06-03 19:49:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Jay Mo is a great teacher and a cool person.  He gives a lot of one-on-one time to make sure you understand what you are doing. And if you don't, he gives you great suggestions that makes sense.
