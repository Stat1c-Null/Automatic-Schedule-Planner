He really challenges you. He cares about his students and their progress in class and in life. You learn a lot from his structural engineering background. He's fun to be around and his class is always really easy going and lightweight even though the work is sometimes hard core. HIGHLY recommend him!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjM1MDA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":14,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
