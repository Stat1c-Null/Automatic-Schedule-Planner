He is extremely drawing heavy & you will 100% get behind if you don't understand the drawings. Most of the professors use the modern software but not him.

For those who don't have an art background, be warned that maybe this isn't the course/major for you, as it is very drawing heavy and it'll set you behind. He moves fast. Always wants you to improve no matter how good it may be, but is very kind when saying so.
