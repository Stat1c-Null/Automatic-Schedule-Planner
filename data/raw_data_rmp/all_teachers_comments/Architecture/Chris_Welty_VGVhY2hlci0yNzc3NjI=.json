I took him for Decomm II. He says he has a attendance policy but he never takes attendance. He also allows you to skip class when you're having a review in studio. He's lenient with deadlines. Its a very laid back class. He's very understanding and makes class interesting. He also is very clear with what he wants.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjM0OTM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1002","date_posted":"2015-07-24 09:01:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Welty tries his best, but for me it falls short. He never seems to be fully \"present\" when he is talking with you. Though he offers clear advice, it is often not creative nor inspiring. His fake laughter became annoying towards the end of the semester, and I would simply like to ask him, \"What is your true passion?\" bc i don't think it's teaching","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDYzNjYx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN2242","date_posted":"2014-10-16 14:27:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"DCOMM 2 with Welty was a nice experience. The whole semester was spent working in Form Z which he knew quite well so that made it easy for most students. Assigned projects were challenging but not impossible. Can be moody at times but for the most part has a good attitude and energy. Put in the work and you will do just fine.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjYyMjg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1001","date_posted":"2014-10-16 14:18:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall cool guy. Has a sense of humor that may go overboard at times. Challenges you in DCOMM 1 to perfect your drafting skills and until you improve good grades will be hard to come by. Has a balanced knowledge of hand drafting and CAD skills. Take him and you learn a lot. Do not be late to class and do not be a slacker if you want to pass.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjYyMjM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN2242","date_posted":"2014-08-12 11:57:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Heard great things prior to attending his class. As a junior it was the worst class i have taken in arch. He expects very much for a two credit hour course. If you really want to take him make sure you complete your work with great quality. Spend more time on it then necessary. He loves extra effort and students who can raise the bar in the class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTIxNTE5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN2241","date_posted":"2011-06-11 11:46:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"he's down to earth, he comes off as a smart a. at first but when you get used to it you realize he's just really funny.
