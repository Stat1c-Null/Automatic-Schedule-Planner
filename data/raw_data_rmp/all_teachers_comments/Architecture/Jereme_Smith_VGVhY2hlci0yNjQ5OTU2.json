He set up daily tasks to help us with our time management so that we would get, at least, most of our things finished in time for reviews. He brought in jurors that gave useful constructive criticism!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTg5Mjg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Gives good feedback--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1002","date_posted":"2022-05-12 02:05:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Professor Smith for Studio II and he is very thorough in terms of directions and what he wants with your projects! AMAZING at giving feedback. Also very funny and empathetic, I have nothing bad to say about him--He created a positive, welcoming environment.
