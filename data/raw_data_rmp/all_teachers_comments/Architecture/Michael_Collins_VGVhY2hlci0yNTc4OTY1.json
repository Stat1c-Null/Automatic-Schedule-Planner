Also, his lectures are basically worthless as all the quizzes are and chapter questions are from the textbook. He also assigns difficult and broad assignments which require specific answers that can be hard to find. I would not recommend him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njk5MDkz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CM3110","date_posted":"2020-12-17 17:21:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Cons: Poor Speaker, Very Unorganized, Doesn't Post Grades in a Timely Manner, Doesn't allow Student to see Quizzes after they are graded to see what they got wrong Pros: He's fair, He's friendly, He responds to emails, He will work with you if you have an issue","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTIxMDk5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CM3500","date_posted":"2020-10-26 23:15:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"He does respond to emails well and is good about letting you turn things in past due date. For Building Codes you can tell he got all this work from another professor and is just giving it to us without any understanding of it himself. There is absolutely NO CLEAR DIRECTION in the instructions. In our group me we were all just guessing.

We havent learned a single thing in the class. Most of the time he just gives us projects, we have to figure it out ourselves, and then gives 4 hours till its due with no warnings. No instructions and we pretty much taught ourselves the entire class. Hes a nice guy but is no help.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTkxNjQ4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
