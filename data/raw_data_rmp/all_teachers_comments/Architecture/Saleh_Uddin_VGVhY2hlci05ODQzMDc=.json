Also has sky-high standards, tough and sometimes unclear critiques, and overall was the most difficult professor I've ever taken. You will learn valuable lessons at the cost of your sleep. Acts more as a client rather than a mentor and wants projects in his preferred style.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Njc2Njky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH2003","date_posted":"2023-12-14 00:02:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"2nd year studio. Doesn't understand the time it takes to complete assignments, so he gives a lot. At the beginning of each project the pace is good, but the FINAL deliverables are rushed, and you can't finish.  If you are okay with modernism then you will be fine, but if you like anything remotely traditional then DON'T TAKE HIM!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjU5MTc4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH2241","date_posted":"2021-01-21 19:34:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Uddin is a great professor for DECOM II. Having him online during COVID, made this class easy for me to learn key factors for my architecture journey. He went step by step how to use Adobe software and Revit, which made it so much easier to do studio projects. I received a B, but I was also in the process learning new programs. Nice guy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MzAzNDI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?

It will make u think that it actually matters, but it really doesnt cause ur grade will be the overall of whatever the jury gives u during reviews. He doesn't add his own input to ur final grade.
