He doesn't shut down a student's design he pushes you to pursue it and explore it more. If the workload ever feels too much, he is willing to help his students by removing some of the deliverables or extending deadlines. Overall I would really recommend him.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzAxMzQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
