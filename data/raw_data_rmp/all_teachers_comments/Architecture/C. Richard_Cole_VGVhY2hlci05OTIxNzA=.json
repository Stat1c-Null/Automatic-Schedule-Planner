His only problem was lacking the ability to motivate students, as he is used to upper level students who have a stronger worth ethic. Lots of knowledge, great fun, and willing to help if asked. Must be able to manage your own time.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDAxMzcx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN2003","date_posted":"2012-04-09 17:01:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Cole is an awesome teacher. He makes you think about what you need to do for the projects but helps and will tell you this is what he likes as an idea...but tough during reviews..got a C in the class but learned so much from him take him if you wanna learn more.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDE4NDQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH3913","date_posted":"2010-01-14 21:42:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Brilliant and always helpful!
