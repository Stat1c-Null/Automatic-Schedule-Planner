He's always in a good mood, and always there for help. He is also very encouraging. His classes are easy, but you do need to participate and do whatever work he gives you to do.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NjIyMzc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM4230","date_posted":"2016-12-22 11:13:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"He has a few pet peeves to be aware of if you are going to take future classes: 1. Do not just refer to him as \"Eckford.\" You can call him \"Al\" or \"Professor\" but never just \"Eckford.\" 2. Do not skip class, and pay attention. Tests are based on what is taught in class. 3. Tests are easy and graded based on key words that you use.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjAyMDI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
