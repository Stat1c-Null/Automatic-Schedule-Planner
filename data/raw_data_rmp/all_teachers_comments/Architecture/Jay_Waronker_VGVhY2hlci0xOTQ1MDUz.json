He is unclear with deadlines and his grading is very harsh. Many people in my class have C's or D's. I always leave his class feeling deflated.

Some of his critiques are not helpful and unnecessary.

Unfair grading/grades all over the place. Expect to receive 5-20 points below what u usually get with every other professor out there. I always do very well in my classes/get along with the professors but in this one I noticed his fairness of grading was all over the place. Id avoid if possible.

I had him for an online course this semester and hes probably the most confusing professor Ive had. The way he grades is pretty inconsistent, so sometimes I dont know if Ill do good on a project or not. He also rambles a lot during meetings without explaining much of anything.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTI0Mjg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART2150","date_posted":"2020-07-18 17:54:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He's a nice guy and maybe he's a much better in person, but for an online class, definitely not. He didn't teach at all; just linked us to videos made by other people on how to draw. Ask for a 1-1 session to make up a missed class? He'll set one up then later cancel saying the info sheet is clear enough.

Assigned a ridiculous amount of super long essays. Failed almost the whole class. Didnt teach a thing, just shows slides of buildings. Loved to remind us he went to Harvard.
