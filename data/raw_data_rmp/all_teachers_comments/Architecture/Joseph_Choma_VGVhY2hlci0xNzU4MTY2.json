Best college professor I've had so far he really cares about his students and our love for architecture. He is insanely helpful and we all always know what we're doing. In terms of studio work, of course there's plenty but if you like your design he will follow you until the end.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTEwOTEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1002","date_posted":"2013-07-08 13:27:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Deeply cares about his students.  Open minded to your ideas; yet make sure that they are functional. Helpful when stuck in your design process. Stresses perfection on drawings and models. Excellent choice for board organization skills. He's a must for 1st year studio.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTUyNDIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DCOM001","date_posted":"2013-01-03 20:36:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Choma is pretty cool - definitely laidback. I would totally recomend him for DCOM 1241. He is not a difficult teacher by any means, but he is serious when it comes to the drawings. Craft and line weight are important!! If you see a spot open for any of his classes, hurry up and take it because it won't be there long.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjA0ODE1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFNN1101","date_posted":"2012-10-30 18:47:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"the most wanted teacher in architecture.
