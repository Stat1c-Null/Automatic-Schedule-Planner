He mostly teaches you in conversations and sticks around after class to keep the conversation going. Take him if you want a good class. I’d say the best class I had that semester and my favorite studio I had in school.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzQ4MDMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH402","date_posted":"2013-10-31 11:00:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had the pleasure of having Richard for one semester and he has had a lasting impact on me. The things I learned from him inform my life and profession to this day. He has an ability to see the individual in every student and hone their talent. He is able to unsurface their design identity and help them establish a narrative. He is a great mind.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjM4MzYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH4116","date_posted":"2013-09-22 20:51:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"I still remember what a breath of fresh air his class was at a school which wasn’t the best and treated students like we were just tuition checks.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTM0NDA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN2004","date_posted":"2013-09-12 15:46:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher that taught outside the box and was an asset to the program.
