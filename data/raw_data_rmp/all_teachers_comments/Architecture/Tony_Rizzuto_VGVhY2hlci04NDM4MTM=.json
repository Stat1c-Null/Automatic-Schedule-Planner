However, he does pick his favorites and even if you miss most of the classes and don't show a lot of work you will pass. He is interesting to listen to and funny but if you show up to every class and try but he doesn't like your work don't count on passing.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Njg5MTk0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"XXXXX","date_posted":"2008-08-05 09:02:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a GENIUS","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NzE2MDA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH3312","date_posted":"2008-01-14 08:02:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Passionate about the subjects, and quite organized in presentation.

He definitely knows his material and he knows how to relay it to his classes. He does have interesting, but long and elaborate lectures, but if you take good notes and try to start studying more than one day before the test you will do well in his course.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExODMzNTgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
