Our class was always behind, instructions were unclear, and she literally made us think inside the box. Also very unhelpful even though she tries, she can't seem to explain herself appropriately. I didn't learn much at all from her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTEwODky","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1241","date_posted":"2011-12-06 15:29:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Attendance is mandatory and you must be on time. 3 absences = one letter grade drop.  2 tardies = 1 absence. She teaches how to do the assignment, shows an example of the finished project, and then gives you class time to do it and ask questions.  If you need additional assistance she is very willing to work with you.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5Mzk3NjUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN2241","date_posted":"2011-06-13 10:18:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice and polite professor. Expects students to attend and start class on time which was never a problem for me. She will FAIL you if you don't show up! If you show up and do the work you'll do fine in the class. She's very willing to help everyone individually after she gives the lesson.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NzI2MDg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
