Professor Soleimani has been, in my short experience with him, one of my favorite professors to work with. He is always enthusiastic about architecture and has inspired me to do more with computational design.

He's very knowledgeable in the material. The tests were not bad as long as you were in class and took notes on slides (he provides them). The lectures can be very long though. He has extra credit questions in class to help your grade. There are 2 major group projects you will complete. Overall, not too difficult.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjA4OTc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH2311","date_posted":"2021-12-16 17:09:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Soleimani is straightforward when lecturing and a bit strict when students don't do as told, but he is nice.

From the beginning he tells you what he expects. There are 2 tests based on the lectures. He gives a pretest each time. The group projects are weighted more than the tests so put more effort in those (these projects are extensive). Have a car because of in-class field trips. Class typically ends an hour early.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MzI0MDY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COS126","date_posted":"2017-05-08 16:27:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Soleimani is without a doubt one of the best studio professors I've had.
