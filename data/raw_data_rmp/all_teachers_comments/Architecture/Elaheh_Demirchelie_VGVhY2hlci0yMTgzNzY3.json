Grades are more of an afterthought compared to your work towards your career. No worries about student competition: she grades each individual according to personal progress. Both group meets and one-to-one talks are the norm.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTIwMjE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1001","date_posted":"2016-11-21 12:32:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor will challenge you.

Shes very passionate, firm and fair when it comes to the work, and the class went beyond simply learning the material. She shared her heart and experiences not only to connect with students, but also to show us a mindset and spirit thats suitable for the field.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjMzMzk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1001","date_posted":"2016-11-19 15:53:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best Professor Ive had she really makes you work to improve your skills and you will never have a dull moment in her class.
