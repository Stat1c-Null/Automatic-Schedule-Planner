The tests were almost impossibly hard and he seemed to take pride in that fact. Was actively critical of student work but rarely gave constructive criticism. I worked as hard as I possibly could for this class and still consider it a miracle that I even passed. I do not recommend this prof.

He is very critical, and talks SO MUCH. He will often expect you to know things he hasn't talked about because he expects you to read the textbook. Read the abstract and try to \"think outside the box\". He is a funny little man, super passionate, and won't fail.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjQyOTEx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1002","date_posted":"2022-05-10 04:22:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is tuff but you learn a lot. Need to know how to draft correctly or you will learn how to really quickly. very detailed-oriented. nice guy but can seem tuff and intimidating at times.

Comes off a bit harsh for reviews, but he does care about the work you're producing. Very passionate about good concepts. Make sure you attend class. Looks over all work at end of semester and you have a portfolio. Great for building up your arch skills and grit!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzkzMDQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ARCH1011","date_posted":"2021-03-02 21:16:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"His abstracts are insanely convoluted and he doesn't even know what he wants for each assignment. The workload is insanely difficult and none of his feedback is positive. He DOESN'T GIVES YOU GRADES until the end of the semester for some stupid reason. He expects you to always be working and never take a single break. In other words don't take him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDAzMDc5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ARCH1011","date_posted":"2020-12-04 22:30:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"AKA Willie Pittman: I was a 4.0 student who put 40+ hrs into his studio every week. DO NOT TAKE! Condescending, laughs when you're wrong, won't tell you what's wrong, expects answers students don't know, constantly contradicts himself and changes criteria for projects.
