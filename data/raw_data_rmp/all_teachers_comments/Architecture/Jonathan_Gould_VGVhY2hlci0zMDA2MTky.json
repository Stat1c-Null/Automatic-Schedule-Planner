He was amazing, understanding our struggles and helping us get out of a box when we were stuck. He is firm on deadlines, especially pin-up, like any studio class. He was gentle in suggesting changes, but you could tell when something was off, ask, and he provides feedback of where he wants you to go.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzIxNDg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1002","date_posted":"2024-05-02 17:42:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor. He is very caring and respectful. What I liked about his teaching strategy is that he is able to provide you with a lot of creative freedom while making sure you are producing your best work. He also acknowledges your time and gives you plenty of it for you to complete the assignments. 10/10 experience :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzQyMDI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1002","date_posted":"2024-04-30 15:15:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Gould is a great teacher. He never gives a yes or a no answer and tries the best to give you your own freedom to create what you want while giving fun modules. His attitude towards the class really makes you feel like he is just one the students. His only downside is the fact I prefer to have a yes or a no answer sometimes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzExODcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1002","date_posted":"2024-04-30 15:14:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a very likable person. In terms of an architecture professor, he's pretty good. The only issue I had was a lack of feedback. A lot of times the feedback given was very generic like \"yeah that looks good\" or \"I like it\" when on the rubric after he grades you're taken points off for something he didn't critique at the time.
