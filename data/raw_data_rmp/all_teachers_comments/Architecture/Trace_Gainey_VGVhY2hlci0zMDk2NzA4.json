His D-com class is more difficult, as he has less of an understanding of digital media, but he matches D-com to his studio class so the software you learn is usable immediately.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTg4ODky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1000","date_posted":"2025-07-28 18:30:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great professor! His lectures are very interesting, and he encourages everyone to participate in them. I had him for Arch 1000, and I think he was awesome for a first architecture class. I would definitely take him again, if I could.

Gave very clear directions for his assignments and allowed for a lot of exploration to easily run into inventing things with the software. I learned a lot from him and his amazing TAs that also were there to answer many of my questions. All around he's a wonderful and patient professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTI0MDE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
