Pretty much forces you to get used to heavy experimentation. He's very flexible (except deadlines) and encourages mingling with peers. Frank is pretty laid back and will vouch for his students.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTEzNzA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1001","date_posted":"2025-01-07 23:14:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved having Frank!

He explains the work very well, and records his lectures in case you need go back. It's a lot of work, and he won't let you submit after the deadline but that's a good thing. He's available to meet online or in person most days, and truly wants you to succeed. He is very detail oriented and expects the best work.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzY3MzU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH2242","date_posted":"2023-08-09 23:09:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gives pretty good feedback.

Students who take this class with him typically take it to be challenged. You learn a ton of information at a fast pace. But if you work hard you will have a great knowledge base to help in upper years. However... If you miss one class he knocks off 2 points from your grade.
