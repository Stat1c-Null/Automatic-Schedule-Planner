Has no idea about the subject matter he his teaching, is late to 100% of the classes. Everything was transitioned to an online course and he was still able to be late to an ONLINE TEST. Has not posted 1 grade to the course D2L. Has not responded to any email I have sent. Horrible.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTUwNjUy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CM3410","date_posted":"2020-03-25 14:41:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take this professor, he is completely unorganized and 20mins late every class. His test were impossible, typically 10-20 pages and on information you would only know if you are working in the field. He even said at the end of the semester no one would fail his class or get D's because he was all over the place. But that was obviously a lie.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTkxNzc1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CM3410","date_posted":"2019-12-20 17:44:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take this professor. He is very unclear on the grading layout. He said all semester that he was going to curve all grades but never explained a clear path to how he would do this. He changed the syllabus more than twice. He was late every class. He was 45 minutes late on exam day. DO. NOT. TAKE. I barely made C, and know some people failed.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzMwMzc4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
