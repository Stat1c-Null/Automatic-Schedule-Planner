She gives students a lot of grace if they have a good excuse as to why something is turned in late, etc. Her instructions on assignments can be a little vague and it does seem like she doesn't really know what she's talking about. But she is a very sweet lady who loves her students. Thats more than most teachers.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDA5NDc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3180","date_posted":"2024-01-31 22:44:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Looks like she never worked construction in her life yet she teaches it. Such a critique grader and makes the assignments difficult for no reason. She goes based on the powerpoints and she has a hard time connecting it to real-world examples.
