She gives out a lot of work but gives you the opportunity to resubmit work for a better grade. She provides a grading rubric and schedule so that students know what to expect. She's one of the few professors that let's you work on your own ideas.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzY3NDE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Gives good feedback--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH1000","date_posted":"2023-07-29 00:53:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Arezou is wonderful. Shes so refreshing and optimistic. What I like about her the most is she actually cares about her students and shows it by having one on one conversations with everyone almost every class. If you get a chance, take her.

She seems sweet enough but it was difficult at times to understand what shes saying. Most of class spent going over ppts and calling on students to answer questions. I hear good things about her students studio work. Classwork is pretty straightforward, but having her for Intro felt a little underwhelming to say the least.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODAyNzUy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
