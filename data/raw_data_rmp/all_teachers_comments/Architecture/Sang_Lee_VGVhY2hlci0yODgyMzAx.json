He was a great listener and cared deeply about each student. So, it was easy to talk to him and gain feedback for this course.\n\nStudio was fun, but unclear assignments sometimes confused.

He gives unclear information to students. He is constantly late to class and berates students for being late as well. Mostly gives students 60s and 70s. He doesn't understands the assignments we are given and he has a lot of anger issues. He has been on the brink of screaming matches between students many times.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjUxODE0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH2003","date_posted":"2024-12-12 04:00:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is very unmotivated and discouraging. There was a problem about his grading system and when students approach the issue he found it threatening. His feedback was always confusing and not inspiring. I couldn't find a way to improve on my projects that would please him. I felt like I didn't learn anything this course.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjQxODkz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARCH2003","date_posted":"2024-08-11 23:55:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very difficult and can seem stand-offish at times but wants to see his students succeed. Workload and critiques are tough but the work is worth it in the end. Does not stay later than the usual time for studio, make sure to get critiques early in classtime.

He is not sympathetic. He has an excessive amount of work, more than studio work, and does not have leniency when it comes to grading. Very poor communication, and cannot speak English well so his lectures are hard to understand.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTA3MjQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
