He was our graduate TA for the semester and was so helpful when it came to our writing and experiments. I had to miss class during the semester due to athletics and he would come in, sometimes on weekends, to help me run my experiments. He also helped me understand biochem topics that Dr. Leeper didn't explain really well. :)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1ODQyMTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
