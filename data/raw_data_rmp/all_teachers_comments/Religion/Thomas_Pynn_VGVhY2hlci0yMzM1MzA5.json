I get that as a college student youre supposed to know your stuff, BUT THIS MAN LITERALLY BASE HIS TEST OFF OF HOW YOU WRITE. THIS IS AN UNDERSTANDING PEACE AND CONFLICT CLASS. NOT. AN. ENGLISH. CLASS. GRADE ME OVER WHAT IVE LEARNED. NOT HOW I WRITE. Yes.

He posts nine or ten test prompts (paragraph per prompt) about a week before the test and then five of them are the actual test. You can meet with him during office hours and work on the actual prompts that you are struggling with. A lot of awkward silence in class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzY4Mjg4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"RELS1102","date_posted":"2018-11-08 21:26:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wished I had not taken this class. It is super stressful and if you miss one day you're really behind. Focuses on books that are hard to understand and interpret. When asked a question he often goes on tangents and does not really give a clear answer. Do not take this professor unless you love being stressed all the time.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjkwMjM4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

Was originally honors course, changed to regular and same information was taught. 3 tests are the ONLY grades, so if you do poor you will NOT pass. Hardest class I have ever taken. Tests based on books (hard to interpret), lectures, and tedtalks/videos. Not very understanding. Do not skip. Note heavy. Very detailed.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjYzMTE2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

If you opposing views as him, get ready to debate your personal life. The class itself is not hard, he a stickler about attendance. Doesn't follow his own syllabus or the revisions. Papers take a while to be returned. Goes off on tangents about personal history.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTQwMDUy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ASIA1102","date_posted":"2018-03-23 00:31:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Pynn's Asian Studies class was rather interesting to say the least. I was in the Year of India learning community and this class was a requirement to be in the LC. He is very lecture heavy and tends to do most of his lectures from the required reading. His tests are all written tests. Be prepared to sit through a lot of awkward silence.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njg2NjA3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
