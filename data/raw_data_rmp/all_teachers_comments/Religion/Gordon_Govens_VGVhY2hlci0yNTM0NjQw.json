The class was structured around readings and thinking critically about them. Those who cut corners got penalized. No mediocrity here. Dr. Govens was caring and willing to help in any way possible (even beyond the course material). 10/10.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjc4Njgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"RELS1102","date_posted":"2020-05-22 18:49:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a great guy but really expects you to put a lot of time and effort into his assignments. He's got a lot of degrees and has been to some prestigious schools so make sure you're willing to put all the effort he expects. We wrote 2 big papers and had weekly reading responses. He said he'd make us do quizzes and tests if we didn't put in effort.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMzU1NTI0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HON1100","date_posted":"2020-05-15 20:14:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Although he only gives one assignment per week, Dr. Govens expects that assignment to be the greatest work ever written. His lectures can be inspiring, however the grading criteria can vary greatly! He would take off points for the smallest thing and would not really explain how to improve.

For the written daily reviews make sure you read the rubric because he follows it exactly. If you miss a page he takes off a lot of points so make sure you keep up with them.
