Easy A, very flexible on grades, discussion posts were basically participation grades. Just do the work and you'll end up with an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDk5ODc1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"RELS-1102","date_posted":"2024-11-13 20:48:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice but every time without fail was 15-20 minutes late to class sometimes more. Powerpoints were unorganized and hard to follow. E-lectures were never posted on time. Canceles class at the last minute and is very unreliable. Lots of reading that doesn't really help. Doesn't post grades till the end of the semester. I don't recommend!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTQyMzgy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"RELS-1102","date_posted":"2024-11-04 19:23:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Eli is VERY nice and could appear caring, but that's not the case. If your professor is 15-20 minutes late to class every, single, time (not an exaggeration), apologizes for not answering emails but still doesn't answer them, & waits halfway through the year to post a single grade, would you feel cared for as a student? Choose another professor.
