He really lets you have your own opinions. The class really is not that hard. He just wants you to enjoy learning about religion. There is not a lot of busywork. Also, the essays were not hard at all and he is not very harsh on grading. He gives great feedback! Just make sure to do your work!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTk4MjA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
