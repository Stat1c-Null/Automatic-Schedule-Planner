It doesn't matter if you run, jog, or even walk the whole entire class. She doesn't grade based on how fast you are. You just have to participate. Gives out 2-3 small homework assignments, but the final is based off info she repeats in class so many times that you do not need to ever study.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NjQ2Mzk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1570","date_posted":"2015-04-04 15:20:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I will never take her again! I missed two classes for court reasonings and she then tells me a day of the final that i missed alot of assignments and alot of days of class which is a lie!!!! She never gives back work and is hard to get in contact with about grades! This is a 1 credit class that i took only to be full time and im very dissapointed!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTQzOTc3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
