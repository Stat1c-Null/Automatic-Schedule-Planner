We did a diet journal and focused on health as well as fitness. This class really inspired me to eat clean and workout more.

Very clear, easy to understand instructions and she's not afraid to open up with her students and really form relationships. My class was all female and there were several classes where we just sat and talked through any negative energy we had going on. AMAZING class & I would LOVE to take it again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODk1NTI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1480","date_posted":"2015-11-03 19:09:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing instructor. I took her for Yoga and I really enjoyed it. She makes it incredibly easy to understand and it ended being one of my favorite classes of the semester. She's very easy going. Make sure to go to every class though. The only project we had the whole semester was a diet journal which was easy enough. Highly recommended!
