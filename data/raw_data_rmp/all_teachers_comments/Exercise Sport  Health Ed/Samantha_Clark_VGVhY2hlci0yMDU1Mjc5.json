The problem is not Clark. The problem is 100% the interface you have to get your book and assignments through (Bearface). I LITERALLY FAILED THIS CLASS BECAUSE OF BEARFACE. Clark wont/ cant do anythi ng to help with your tech issues.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzAwMTMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECON238","date_posted":"2016-11-24 18:35:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best professor I have ever had.

Her lectures are just repetitive information that you already know read vebatum. This professor is unresponsive to students' contacting her and will ignore your emails. Cancels class after a 7 minute lecture.  Randomly selective on which assignments she actually  grades. Don't talk, laugh, eat, or drink. Good luck.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzQyOTA5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Audit/No Grade","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2016-01-14 14:44:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is friendly and easy going, but the website (Bearface) used for this class is very very confusing and unreliable. One time she assigned a four page paper in size 10 font for one kid making a joke in class. Everyone was punished because of it so that sucked. There is no tests so you don't really have to show up.

One issue I had was there was not much clarity on when assignments were due, because the website is still new to the class. Also, she got mad at us once & assigned a 4 page paper at 10 pt. font just to punish us.  The content was interesting and useful for everyday life.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzE2NTU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
