We used bearface instead of d2l and I was pleasantly surprised at how organized and easy bearface was to use. There are 6 modules with homework assignments in each and a quiz at the end of each. NO CUMULATIVE FINAL! Assignments are easy, quizzes are semi-difficult be very do-able. Decent workload, but easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTE1Nzc3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1100","date_posted":"2017-05-17 09:12:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"The expectations for her Wellness 1100 class is high, especially since its already made, her involvement was unsat all semester (only several announcements),  1 extra credit assignment. late on grading assignments, but not exceptions on late work. \"Make sure you use paragraphs, this is college sentence answer wont do.\" (Dr. Weaver) 89.4027 got a B","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzMwMjU4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2017-04-27 00:51:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Weaver has a great online class. She is clear about her expectations. She does use Bearface instead of D2L it is around $80 for the key to buy Bearface (no text book) but it is easy to use (use chrome). She maps the entire course out in her modules. You work on time, submit it and you get an A. Extra credit available. Very fair and responsive.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTM5Mjgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2016-07-15 12:59:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy online class.

I didn't want to take her class, but I did it anyway. And I'm so glad I stuck with it! Her lectures are more of a conversation than her teaching. There are no tests- instead, you will be working all semester long on your final exam. And she only has class once a week (only if TR class).
