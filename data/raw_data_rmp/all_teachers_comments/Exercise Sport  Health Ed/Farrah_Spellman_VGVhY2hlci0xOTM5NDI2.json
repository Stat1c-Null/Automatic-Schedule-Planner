Tests are online, so you can use your book which I would definitely buy. I would take her again for sure!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTA3MTI4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2014-12-12 21:49:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Spellman is really funny. She has powerpoint slides and gives easy assignments. All tests are online so you can use your book so you really dont have to take notes in class.

Her class is extremely easy and she is literally hilarious!! Her knowledge of the subject actually makes the class worth going to. The class can be boring at times but she tries to get everyone involved if she can tell we're bored. I heard HPS sucks as a class but with Spellman it is so worth it!!

She's pretty cool and discussion in class was interesting. She's experienced in her field so she knows her fitness stuff. Her ppts are from the book and she goes by fast so you steadily stop writing stuff down. Tests are online open book. They are not the easiest even with the book but you can get As.

I wish I could have her for every class! She's hilarious and wants you to succeed. You are graded on 4 exams, homework from the book, and there's plenty of extra credit. Tests are online with 4hr plus time limit. Homework is usually one or two pages from the book, but is pretty simple. This is an easy A! Take it!

We've had only one day of physical activity. You can just sit back, relax, sign the roll and listen. No phones though. If you're late, you have to do burpees in front of everyone.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzAzNDYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
