Mrs. Lowe is a runner herself and really passionate about it. She has cool stories to share and very inspirational.

One of the best teachers I've had at KSU. She sounds mean on emails but when you meet her, you'll be surprised at how caring she is. As a person, she's straightforward and funny, too. She's always inspiring us with amusing anecdotes from her past and current experiences as a runner, mom, and wife. Take her if you can.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODAwNDk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1570","date_posted":"2015-10-31 16:44:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great teacher and an easy grader. When I took the midterm, the assignment did not send to her and she gave me an extension to send it to her. She is a little humorous but a great person.
