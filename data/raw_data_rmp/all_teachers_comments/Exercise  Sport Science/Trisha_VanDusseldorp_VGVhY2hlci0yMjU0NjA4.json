At first, I was unsure. Her approach was different then I was use too in terms of exams, every class &#8220;quizzes&#8221; etc. But she will make you feel comfortable and you will learn! She's 100! Highly recommend.

The class was online and had lecture quizzes due each week. VERY LECTURE HEAVY. Lecture were super long and no powerpoints uploaded for you. Several other random assignments besides quizzes.
