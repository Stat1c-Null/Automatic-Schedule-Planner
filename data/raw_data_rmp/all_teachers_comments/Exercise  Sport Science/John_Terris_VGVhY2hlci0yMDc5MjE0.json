The dude's really chill, he's very nice, easy to talk too and I enjoyed learning the basics from him. I would love to go to his gym and learn more about fencing (till corona hit). Warning: he talks a lot. He knows so much about everything, it's cool to hear him talk but sometimes he forgets we're there to fence. Very nice.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTI1NzA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1870","date_posted":"2019-11-11 01:05:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I was kinda skeptical about taking this class in the beginning, but I really enjoyed it, and HIGHLY recommend it to any. It was super easy and fun, and you just got to show up and try and you will pass, and the class itself is super fun. Also the final is the easiest test you will ever take in your lifetime. Take this class you won't regret it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzkwMDgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

Great coach, and a great dude all-together. If you miss class he will let you make it up at his gym. Really smart guy, who you can tell loves what he does. Hopefully they will offer more fencing classes in the future!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTc5MTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
