He is deliberate about the content necessary for learning while making it a blast to learn. He has exemplified what it means to be an effective communicator, personable during lectures, and just a genuine human being. He cuts out A LOT of busy work and is a \"player's coach\" ","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDc3NTA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES3800","date_posted":"2023-09-27 16:20:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr McLester is the GOAT","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjM3OTQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES3800","date_posted":"2023-05-09 18:41:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Graded by 3 tests only. If you are not a good test taker/ have test anxiety, it will be a struggle. He does a study guide review day that is helpful. Otherwise listen to lectures carefully to get the answers to the study guide/course content as he sprinkles in course content with his stories and mythbusters videos. Does not use P.P. to lecture.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODczNTky","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES3800","date_posted":"2021-07-20 10:58:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Dr. McLester for biomech and ex phys 2, and he is the kind of professor that the world needs more of! He genuinely cares about you and wants you to succeed. He takes letter grains with a a grain of salt and analyzes all of his tests to make sure that they are truly fair.

He is one of those professors who genuinely wants their students to succeed in all aspects of life, not just school. Biomechanics is 3 tests, but they are easy if you do the study guide. I would definitely take him again.

Only grades are 3 tests but the tests come straight from the study guide and he will give you the answers to the study guide in class the period before the test if you ask for them.
