BUT I do think it wouldve been easier to learn the material in a regular semester. I personally think he teaches better than other professors in this major, but the content isnt easy!!! You have to study!!! Every!!! Day!!! Especially in summer.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTk1ODAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES4700","date_posted":"2021-07-30 01:16:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Look I loved him because he was so funny and I actually learned in his class, but it was a summer class and the way he organized the tests you would have to learn so much in 3 days. ALSO I liked him until I got a 79.9 and he GAVE ME A C!!!!! Like seriously????? Does it effect him so much to not give me a B??!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTk0ODc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES3900","date_posted":"2020-07-21 04:00:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pros: Knows the content, Good at giving lectures, Replies to emails promptly. Cons: NO STUDY GUIDES! NO FEEDBACK ON EXAMS! (i.e. missed questions), 20%+ Fill-in-the-blank on all exams (Better know how to spell all your enzymes!). It is just cruel expecting a student to be able to do well in a medical-based class with those 3 cons combined.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTIxNzQx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ES4650","date_posted":"2020-04-20 15:40:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have had many tough professors in my college career but this man is by far the worst. His tests are impossible and his communication is subpar. The one good thing I will say is he knows what he is doing in the lab and can give some helpful feedback on how to improve on techniques. Other than that I would recommend taking another professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDg5OTQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ES4700","date_posted":"2017-12-06 20:48:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"I liked Dr. K a lot. I am on the edge of an A and a B. He is a hard professor, but his tests are fair and a lot easier than his lectures. If you asks questions he tries to help you to understand. He also does a review at the beginning of every class. Take notes on these because it's a good review for the test! I would take him again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDcxNDk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Would take again","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES4700","date_posted":"2017-04-21 09:00:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you're looking for a sarcastic teacher that just sits behind a desk and lectures you, then this is your guy. He expects you to remember everything from previous classes and ridicules you if you do not. His lectures are very long, dense, and content heavy. There are a few lab days that could help your grade. Tests are online in class. No curves.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDk1Njc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
