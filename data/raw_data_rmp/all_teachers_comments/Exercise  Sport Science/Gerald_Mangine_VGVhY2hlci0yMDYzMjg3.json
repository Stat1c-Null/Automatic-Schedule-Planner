The assignments are lengthy but thats any professor for this course, just pick a good group. Honestly, I didn't pay attention a single day in this class and got a B. He takes attendance for extra credit. His exams are online no lockdown but final exam is in person. He cares most about assignments.

Aside from lab assignments, he grades three practical exams.

The assignments take time so START EARLY! The 3 part assignment is graded heavily. 1st and 2nd not so bad, 3rd is several pages long (word document with tables), around 10-20 pages. He grades strictly on it too.

Does not answer emails fast and I had to email him twice multiple times just to get a response. Gives some extra credit but divides your points earned during those sessions by 3.

With that being said, he often spends an excessive amount of time on the smallest details. Testing is supposed to be in the lab every time. However he replaced 7 classes with lectures instead. Fails you if you miss more than 5 classes...

He cares more about you understanding the material than the grades you get in his class. Therefore, his tests (including the final) are identical to the practice quizzes, he grades leniently, and provides extra credit for attendance.
