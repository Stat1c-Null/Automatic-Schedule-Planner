He gave 10 question quizzes after each chapter covered. Homework in connect. Reviewed quizzes, homework and tests after each was due or completed in class. Very helpful, but has a hard time clarifying and making the information understandable.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDQzOTIx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2010-11-01 10:29:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Green was a great teacher for my first acct class. He takes it slow to make sure that students really understand the material. Really nice! He does give quizzes every week but they help you know where you stand and what you need to study. Power points are online. The book really helped me as well.

Power points teach you nothing and does not work problems on board, which from last semester helped me more than anything. Doesn't make sense a lot of the time and tends to make things very confusing because he doesn't review what we are learning before class so he confuses the class.

As long as you read the book regularly, you have every reason to expect an A. Quizzes and online homework weekly, but it helps keep you on track since the material is tedious.
