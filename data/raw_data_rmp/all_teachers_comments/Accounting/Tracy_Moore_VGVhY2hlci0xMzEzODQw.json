She skipped the sections on credits/debits saying that it was not important. Now I am in ACCT 3100 and completely lost. Thanks a lot for nothing. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MjI0NjQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2010-08-24 14:17:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTQzNzA0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2010-07-29 09:12:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"First of all, this is not a difficult class.  However, this instructor is horrible.  She was never prepared for class.  Very unsure of herself and much of the material.  Very unorganized.  Brags about her background in accounting, and yet her comfort level with material is weak.  You can not use a computer in class.  Hot - NOT!  Heavy!!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDYwMjc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2010-07-18 17:31:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the worst teacher in the business school. She takes attendance and treats you like a 3rd grader. The tests reflect NOTHING she teaches and she refuses give help when you ask, and i do say WHEN because she will confuse you.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDI5NjEx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2010-04-27 23:19:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Recommend if you miss middle school. Mandatory attendance. Belittling to students that don't want to be there. Electronic note taking with laptops is prohibited (even though an electronic textbook is optional/encouraged): &quot;it might be distracting!&quot; Simple material made exceedingly complex (fault of publisher). New text next yr may help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDczMTMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2009-12-14 11:26:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"really does care about teaching but often she doesn't seem prepared for class. frequently has to refer to book for answers to problems - largely because of unsure of herself&#63; feels like a new professor that will likely be a good one.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTQ3NTkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACT2100","date_posted":"2009-08-16 23:36:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher. I took her over the summer and she was extremely helpful. Her quizzes were easy to understand, and she gives a lot of extra credit.She truly wants the the students to learn the material so she explains it very well. I would love to take her again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MTI1OTMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
