Tests were take home and reasonable. Do the homework and take notes in class and you will breeze through. prof Martin makes the class easy to listen to and he is enthusiatic and likes to joke. point blank: take this professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDY4MDYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT4100","date_posted":"2009-01-08 13:19:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very interesting professor.  He made advanced financial accounting very interesting.  Sense of humor keeps the class going.  All exams are take home and can be done with groups of three.  If you pay attention in class you should at least get a B. Very smart!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzQwMzQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
