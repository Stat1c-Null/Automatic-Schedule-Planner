She made me LIKE tax! Extremely helpful, lets you re-do exams for a percentage of points back, and sincerely cares about your performance in the class. There are a lot of projects but all are very doable! My easiest acct class the whole semester!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjk4MzIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT4250","date_posted":"2013-04-08 08:43:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great prof. and makes the requirements crystal clear. Lectures are thorough, lots of note taking and she speaks fast. This course is a TON of work (online homework, 3 quiz, 3 exams, two tax projects). But she gives partial credit extra chances for re-work done correctly.

Not enough time to finish exams. She is horrible about posting grades and it takes her forever to post new material which is very frustrating.

She gives you plenty of opportunities to succeed. She goes out of her way to help you and her teaching methods are the best. You can easily get an A in the class if you do your work, study and ask for help when needed.
