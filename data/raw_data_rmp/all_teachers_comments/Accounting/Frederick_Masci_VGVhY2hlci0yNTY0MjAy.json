Pick a good group. He is strict on grammar. Also, speaker summaries and quizzes for grades. Quizzes are straight from the textbook, but I didn't buy the book. I just got pics from others.

You can do exactly what he asks of you and he will still give you a bad grade. He doesn't believe in giving 100's but he will give you an F on something you expect an A on.

It's not him, ITS THE CLASS! Accounting is difficult and new to many people taking it. But Masci literally follows exactly what any other Acct teacher does with assignments and tests on Connect.

I like that he is on the board for a non-profit for special needs kids. He is still learning but I can tell from taking him that he cares about students and wants them to succeed.
