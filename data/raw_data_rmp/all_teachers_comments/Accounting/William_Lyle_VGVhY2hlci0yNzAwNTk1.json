He is just well spoken and charming. The class consists of a lot of online hw, 4 exams, and 2 projects but theyre very reasonable.

The material was semi-difficult. Pretty funny and makes lecture fly by. There is extra credit that can increase your grade by about half a letter grade. There is a lot of hw that can take time but is just completion grade. Attendance wasn't required but helps.

I will say there is quite a bit of work you have to do as there is tons of homework, discussions, quizzes, smart connects, a group project, but if you study it's super easy.
