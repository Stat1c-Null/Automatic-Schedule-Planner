The group project is a lot of work, and if you have a slacker in your group, the only recourse is the survey at the end. He also doesn't answer emails. I sent him 4-5 and never got an answer until I saw him in class and asked him in person.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzQ3Nzg5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Graded by few things--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ACCT8000","date_posted":"2020-12-29 02:58:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Larry Stevens is very knowledgeable and had a lot of experience in accounting. I took an online format class in Fall 2020. Four tests 20% weightage (40 questions, 2 hours, locked browser, not an open book test), group project 20% weightage. Prof. Stevens responds to emails very quickly and clarifies doubts outside the classes also.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjEwNzQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Group projects--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACT8000","date_posted":"2019-12-13 14:49:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class requires you to understand the concepts and apply them to problems. The exercises in the chapters are a must. Stevens added quizzes (non-graded) for practice because he realized it helped us pass the tests. He is very accessible and wants his students to pass. He will meet you outside of class to make sure you understand the concepts.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjQzOTI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
