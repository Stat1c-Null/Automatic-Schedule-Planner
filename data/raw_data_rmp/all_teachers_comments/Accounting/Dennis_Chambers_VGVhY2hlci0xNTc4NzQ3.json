If you master the examples' concepts, then you'll be fine; He won't try to fool you.

HW is much more in depth than in class. Tests are 15 questions only - no room for error. Pros: HW, LearnSmart, and quizzes are a good cushion and he grades on a curve.

He was pretty knowledgeable about the content and did a good job explaining it for the most part. Only complaints are the tests and HW problems.
