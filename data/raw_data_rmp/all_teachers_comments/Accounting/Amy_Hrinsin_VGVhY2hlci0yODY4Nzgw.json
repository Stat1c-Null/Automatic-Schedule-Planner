She knows what she is talking about and lectures are super clear and thorough. She is super nice and is always willing to help explain questions. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you don't go your grade will suffer since the material is hard to self-teach. She makes the material very easy to learn and understand so go to class!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTQ0MTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT-2102","date_posted":"2023-03-20 16:15:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Hrinsin is AMAZING! Her lectures are very clear and she explains every step of the process. She is also amazing at answering every student's questions fully. She genuinely cares about her students. Accounting is a hard class but she made it easy. Could not recommend her enough.

Very easy to understand and does an incredible job teaching the material. She gives extra credit which is really helpful. Her tests are part online with lockdown and the other half in class on paper.

This lady is pretty great in my opinion. VERY CLEAR study guides and plenty of opportunities to practice the material (unlimited attempts in HW book assignments). The book is clear and the assignments are meaningful. She expects you to work but is accessible and does care about your welfare in the class. I would recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTA0MDA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT-2102","date_posted":"2023-02-04 04:14:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall a great professor for accounting.
