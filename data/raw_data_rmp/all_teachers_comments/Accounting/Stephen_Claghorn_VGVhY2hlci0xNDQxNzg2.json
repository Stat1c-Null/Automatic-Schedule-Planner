Explains the material pretty well and 2 of the tests were open book.  Takes his time on giving back tests and did not let us know what any of our final averages were.  It was frustrating not knowing why I got a B instead of an A and not knowing if he took care of a homework issue for me like he said he would.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDY5Mjc5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2200","date_posted":"2010-07-29 12:20:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I completely agree with the previous comments. He makes the material more understandable than any other ACCT2200 professor. Tests curved, 2 open book. DO NOT COUNT ON BEING ABLE TO CONTACT HIM EVER - it won't happen. And unfortunately he takes his sweet time getting grades back. Boring but super nice. Totally worth taking overall.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDYwNzQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2200","date_posted":"2010-05-11 13:01:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this professor. I would definitely recommend him to anyone at Kennesaw. He curved every test and even made 2 tests open note/book. The only thing I did not appreciate about him was the fact that when grades were due he didnt put ours in. He was a little hard to contact, but he had a lot going on with his family, so that was understandable.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTczMDYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
