For every day after 5 business days he fails to return something, he gives you 1 point on the overall grade for that assignment. he ended up giving us 100's on over 30% of our grade because of how long it took him to grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTY4Mjcz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BISM3100","date_posted":"2010-05-13 11:12:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful person, great teacher!

You never know how he is going to grade you. Doesnt return e-mails or projects for a long time. He seemed to lose interest in the class about half way through.
