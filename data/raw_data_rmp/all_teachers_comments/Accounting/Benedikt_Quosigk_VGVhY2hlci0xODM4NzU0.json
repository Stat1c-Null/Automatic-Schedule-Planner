Lecture consists of going over (on average) one homework problem. Frequent in class quizzes and attendance \"quizzes\". Garbage study guides. He doesn't even TRY to teach. Avoid this professor at all costs!!

He does not prepare students for exam. He doesn't not take input from students. His teaching method is not practical, but rather it's over complected and stupid. I'd rather take the course online than with him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTQ1MjM5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2200","date_posted":"2013-09-25 11:16:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Does not prepare students for the exam, does not know how to teach, waits for students to fail first exam to actually teach.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTM5MzE5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
