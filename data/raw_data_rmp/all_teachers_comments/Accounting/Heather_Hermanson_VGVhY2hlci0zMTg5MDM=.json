On test day its like looking at a foreign language. Don't take her class she will talk you out of being an acct major just bc you don't understand what she is teaching to translate on ur test.

I took Acct. 2100 with Prof. Sheil and got a D. This is an extremely difficult standardized class. Tests are VERY DIFFICULT. I took this class the 2nd time with Prof. Hermanson and she is AMAZING.

She doesn't use the computer to present the class notes and you'd be better off reading a monkeys handwriting than hers at any point.

She was so so helpful and a nice person in general. She understands ACCT is tough so she tries to make it easy as possible. She gives lots of extra credit points, and I think she rounded my grade up, so stick it out!! I definitely recommend her.
