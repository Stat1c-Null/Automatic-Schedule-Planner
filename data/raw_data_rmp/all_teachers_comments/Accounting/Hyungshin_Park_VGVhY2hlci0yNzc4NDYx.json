He gives lots of homework, which is helpful because it balances out your grade (tests are very). Best thing is that if you show him you tried a problem he will help find your mistake. Not an easy class but he will help/ clarify every time you ask.

He really does focus more towards students who want to continue the accounting pathway. He does expect you already have an understanding of Finance. He is available after class, and used to work at KPMG.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzAxMjk0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2102","date_posted":"2022-12-13 18:12:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was very much an accounting 2102 class; lots of homework and resources outside of class. I stopped going to class since lots of the examples in class felt a little too advanced or unnecessary and were more for people who enjoyed accounting.

Two exams are a combined 30% of your grade. The final exam is also 30% of your grade. All of the exams are also online using Proctorio. In case you struggle in the class, he also includes lots of extra credit activities to help your grade. I would recommend this professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODk4NjM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT4550","date_posted":"2022-03-10 10:12:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Knows the subject very well, is a great lecturer and cares about teaching data analytics to accounting students. He walks the class through lots of examples to practice and tests are based on similar questions. Not homework heavy, and there are opportunities for extra credit.
