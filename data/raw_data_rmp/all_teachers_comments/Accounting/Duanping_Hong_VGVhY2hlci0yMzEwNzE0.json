I have always struggled with accounting, but he makes its understandable. He works hard to help his students understand the material and gives thourough reviews before each test. One learnsmart and one homework and chapter.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njg3MjUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2200","date_posted":"2018-03-19 19:18:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher! He is new so there aren't many reviews for him so I was a little nervous going into his class. You shouldn't be, he's great. He is very helpful and tries lots of different strategies to make the class make sense to everyone. Always goes the extra mile and is ready to help outside of class hours. Just a great guy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjY5NTQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He is accessible after classes and will work with you.

This was his first time teaching &amp; he did a bomb job. Super nice &amp; positive attitude. Gave tons of extra credit. 2-3 HW assignments due each chapter but plenty of time to complete. 3 tests. He gives extra credit on tests. Tests are easy if you come to class. He breaks things done &amp; has extended office hours.
