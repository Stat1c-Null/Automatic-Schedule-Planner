He's pretty clear cut, although towards the end he does deviate from the book a tad bit.  His little analogies are funny.   Make sure to show up on time to his class.  He also give pre-test reviews which were helpful.

Didn't seem like he wanted to be teaching though. He stressed he was a student recently.  Would cancel class often. Material wasn't too difficult. I liked that he used real world stuff but if you didn't understand it, you would have to google it because it wasn't in the book. I thought he was ok but I had friends who did not like him.

His lectures prepared you well for the types of questions that are likely to be covered in the exam.  HW's, projects and quizzes in Connect aren't graded as heavily (though it says it on syllabus).  As he would put it, \"test is king\".  He'll give practice problems that will be similar to the exam.

If smthng in the book isn't 'real world\" stuff, he pulls it out. Main focus is understanding concepts not definitions, etc. He does a review before each exam.

He's very unorganized. No grades posted online, grading system unclear, doesn't follow his own syllabus. You have to teach yourself, that being said on review days he has the test in front of him telling you problem by problem the concepts you need to know for the test.
