She is a little difficult to understand, but teaches the concepts well and knows a lot. I did not use the textbook. She's helpful. The tests are not terribly hard. Just go over the problems and you should be fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDk5NDE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2200","date_posted":"2014-04-23 17:45:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very kind, but can come across as blunt. She goes straight through the notes and I had to teach myself because she is hard to follow. She does do examples, but she often seems condescending when you ask questions. If you're diligent and can teach yourself, take her. If not, don't.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDg2MTk5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
