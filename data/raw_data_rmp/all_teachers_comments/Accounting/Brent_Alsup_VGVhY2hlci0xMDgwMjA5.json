He wants everyone to learn and is always willing to explain. The course is not super difficult, but you will learn if you choose to. I have taken him for both 2100 and 2200. There are a few in class assignments, a lot of homework manager, and fair testing/grading.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDQ4NTcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2009-08-21 12:24:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was a pretty easy course. He is a very laid back professor and gives a lot of extra credit. Acct is nowhere near my favorite subject but this class was doable. His tests were all multiple choice. Only downfall was he was late for class probably around 5 times out of the summer semester.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MTM5OTk2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2009-08-15 13:26:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is lazy, comes late all the time. He isn't prepared.  He doesn't know how to explain material in a way you can understand.  A lot of times, he doesn't even know the answer to the questions he gives.Even though he pretty much sucks as a teacher, he's funny and laid back...and he gives a good amount of extra credit.

He failed to show up twice in the length of the course.  It was a saturday class, so missing those two classes made it harder than it should have been, but he made the tests easier to make up for it.  Easy prof, but you don't learn everything you need to know for the next course.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NjU5OTY2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2007-12-20 00:11:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy was totally awesome! He's young and very understanding that everyone needs a good grade. He's very chill and doesn't require a book or homework or even attendance. His tests are easy too. He gives you a review for the tests and then takes questions right from the review. I had no idea about ANYTHING and got a B.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzODc5OTcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
