On most, you will spend at least 2-3 hours. He either over-explains or doesn't explain enough. Only take his class if you MUST. He's not the worst Accounting prof. at KSU.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4ODg4MzQw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2011-05-22 10:20:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Vansant ,atleast, had a sense fo humor. Sometimes he would make a few jokes. He was decent at explaining the concepts but not the caluculations part of material. Sometimes his lectures seemed unorganized, and he would get off topic. He would repeat himself and try to explain concepts again. Howefer, I think he somtimes confused himself.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjQ3MTM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2011-05-10 18:01:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely horrible teacher. Over explains simple concepts and makes them confusing, then doesn't explain the hard concepts nearly enough. If you ask him a question in class, he seems to get irritated at you. The homework is hard and not like the tests at all. The book is also very hard to understand. STAY AWAY!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTcxMDMz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2011-05-09 15:52:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty well weighted class for accounting. 30% of your grade is homework, so if you aren't the best test taker, this class is for you! He isn't the best teacher/explainer, and he doesn't even know basic math. If you are decent at teaching yourself stuff, go for it! The tests are not like the homework at all, study the book and study guides.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTYwNDgw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2011-05-02 19:18:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Horrible way of teaching material only teaches half of what your supposed to know. Might as well teach yourself the material by reading the book. Online homework pretty easy but some stuff on the homework never went over in class only 3 tests so pretty much fail the first one struggling the rest of the semester . i wouldn't recommend taking him ..","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTA5ODUx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2011-04-06 08:25:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"vague with notes and information very nice guy though. homework is online and counts as a test grade which helps a lot","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzY0MTI1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
