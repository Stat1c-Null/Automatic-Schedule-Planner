She's really nice and looks like Erin from the office and sounds like Pam, which was cool. I definitely recommend taking her, she made a Saturday class great, and that's hard to do.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMjIyNzY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"C2100","date_posted":"2018-11-14 20:32:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"the best teacher and highly recommend to take her. she makes the class easier and do not take attendance. if you do take the you will get an A...
