She is great at making hard concepts easier to understand.  She is very helpful and you couldnt ask for a more reasonable instructor.  I would highly recommend her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTE3NDEw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2101","date_posted":"2012-01-20 00:04:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do the extra credit and an A is no problem. The questions on the test are made by the people who make the book and are very unclear and hard only because they are worded to trip you up. I made an 99 point something, if I had not done the extra credit I would have had a low B.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzUwOTUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
