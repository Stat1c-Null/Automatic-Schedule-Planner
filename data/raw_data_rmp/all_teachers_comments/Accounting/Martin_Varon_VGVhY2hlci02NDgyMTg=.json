His class is extremely easy if you attend.  He goes over all the homework questions and puts some of them on the test with different numbers.  He uses the &#63;s at the end of the chapters as class quizzes.

Put some effort into it and it's an easy B.  He likes to give good grades and is very helpful.  Quizzes from book - goes over them in class.  Show up and that's a 100% test grade right there.  It's difficult subject matter at times, but he really does make it understandable.  Still boring subject though :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMTExNzMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2200","date_posted":"2006-04-13 14:58:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"he is boring","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExNzA0NjM4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2200","date_posted":"2005-09-26 17:13:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Varon is a great teacher.

He covers material thoroughly, and makes sure everyone understands. He gives quizzes which come directly from the homework. If you show up and do the work he assigns, you will have no problem getting an A or B.
