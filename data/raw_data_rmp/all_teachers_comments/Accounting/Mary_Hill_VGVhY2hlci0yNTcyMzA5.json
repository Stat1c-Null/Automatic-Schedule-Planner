It is very doable to pass this class as long as you put in the effort. This is not an easy class and you will need to put in the work, but if you give it your best effort you will pass.

Homework and Smartbook checks through Connect. Did take attendance. One of the most AMAZING professors I've taken at KSU. She genuinely cares about the students and makes sure you have everything you need to succeed. Study guide and practice exams provided. Will work if you to help you understand the material.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjI3Nzgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT3100","date_posted":"2020-03-20 15:14:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hill is the best professor I've taken at Coles. Material consists of 2 tests, 1 cumulative final, excel project, ALEKS, learn smart &amp; HW in connect for completion. Attendance not mandatory but recommended. Explains everything very clearly and encourages questions. Super friendly and respectful. Gives study guide &amp; practice test.
