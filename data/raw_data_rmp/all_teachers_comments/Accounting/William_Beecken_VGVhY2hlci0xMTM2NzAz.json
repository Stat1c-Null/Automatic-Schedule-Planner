He has field experience in accounting but has no business teaching students, especially in such a lower level accounting class. His lectures are the most monotone boring things you'll ever sit through. He usually forgets what he's saying mid sentence. Save yourself and do not take a class with him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODg5MTg3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2015-12-09 11:37:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"I think he's a great person and really wanted us to do well. He tried, but it was just hard. The lectures were very basic, long and didn't really make sense making it very hard to pay attention. I basically taught myself. I don't think he is teaching this class again, though. Which is good because it's not his strong suit. He is very nice, though!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NjA1MTEz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2100","date_posted":"2015-12-07 20:39:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not my favorite professor, but not too hard either. He seems to go on and on with same topic, but makes it more confusing along the way. I had to do a lot of studying, because listening to him just confused me. If you have another option I would take someone else, but If you have no choice he's not that bad. Just put in the effort.

Everything is online and the system messes up almost every time you use it. Beecken is okay. He's not extremely helpful or knowledgeable.

Very knowledge is the field of accounting, seems like explaining this subject is elementary to him.  Tells lots of real life examples.  Takes attendance every day.  Overall, pretty good.
