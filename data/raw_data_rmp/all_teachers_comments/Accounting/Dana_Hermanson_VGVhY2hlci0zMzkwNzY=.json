We read some fraud cases each week and discussed the implications during class. He did a great job making the discussions feel energic and lively. There were 3 exams, a group project, and a participation grade. Exams are fairly easy if you go to class. Overall, it was a great time.

Fraud was an interesting class taught by him! You definitely should study and prepare, but if you put a decent amount of effort, this is a pretty Easy A or at least B. His tests and free response and a little hard to prepare for, but he makes it obvious what he'll ask. Great elective class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTEyMTUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT4490","date_posted":"2017-12-06 18:25:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"The nicest professor in all of Kennesaw. I loved going to class, hes funny and the lectures are super interesting. I recommend taking him for any class. His tests are all short answer. Don't think they will be super easy because the material is, you have to really know the information to get full credit. As long as you study well they are easy A's.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDY5MTgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

He's very knowledgable and truly wants his students to learn. The bad thing is that his exams are essay format, which would typically mean that grades would be higher. Not the case.
