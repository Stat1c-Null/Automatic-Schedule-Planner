Does a great job of teaching things. His lectures are complimentary to what is in the book so read the chapter before the lecture. Test are very reasonable.

He truly cares about his students and wants them to understand and learn not just memorize the material. He will work with you if you participate and show a desire to do well. There will be some lecture heavy classes, but he tries to mix in other things so it's not boring. If you don't come to class you wont do well.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NTk1OTYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT4600","date_posted":"2017-12-10 17:35:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is tough but fair.
