I took it online at GPC, and  professor Shorunke provided us with a schedule of due dates so that we could stay on track. Professor Shorunke also offers opportunities to earn extra credit, and responds to any questions you have in a timely manner. Overall,I am very satisfied with the help I received from this professor.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTY1MzU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2101","date_posted":"2013-04-18 19:55:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Professor Shorunke for Accounting 1, and all I can say is that she is a wonderful teacher. She is very lively and fun and does a great job of making the concepts easy to understand. She is also very kind and will stay after class to help her students if they are lost on a concept. Also, she speaks English very well; her accent isn't that bad","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTYyMjM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2101","date_posted":"2013-02-17 16:42:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hard to fail this class. Ms. S is very nice and takes the extra time to make sure everyone understands. Grade comes from: attendance ~19%, quizzes (online - you can use book) ~14%, homework (online; \"check answer\" button shows you wrong answers, which you can change) ~27%, exams (always reviewed) ~41%. Plus, TONS of chances for easy extra credit.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMzQ3Njk5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT1","date_posted":"2012-12-19 15:52:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!!!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTI3MDQ4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT2102","date_posted":"2012-06-20 00:19:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"She seems to be a nice person, but she is an awful professor. Unless you want to teach yourself the entire course you should avoid her at all costs!!! She can barely speak English and the reviews were nothing like the exams which made them impossible. Somehow, however, I made a B in the class, definitely the hardest class I have ever taken.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDI2NjE5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
