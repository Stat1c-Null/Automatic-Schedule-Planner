My biggest criticism is how he teaches. He reads directly from the textbook and is unorganized. I've learned more in my tutoring sessions than with Professor Myers. His assignments are usually 2-3 days apart and are time-consuming.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzUzMzcw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2101","date_posted":"2022-12-07 06:44:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the worst professors i have ever had in my life, His class is so test heavy but yet he doesnt give us enough time too do them.

He tells you exactly what to expect assignment wise. If you work hard and be proactive in his class you will do fine.

He gives a ton of work. He will also take forever or just not respond to messages. The questions on the exams are honestly pretty easy other than you have such little time to complete them which makes the test almost impossible to finish. In his lectures he literally read directly off the slides.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODYyNzAz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2101","date_posted":"2022-10-20 04:11:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"He literally reads from the text book and off the power points.. he does examples in class.. cool i guess. Until the exam rolls around and you on have 75 minutes to answer 25 or more questions and half are filling in account tables.
