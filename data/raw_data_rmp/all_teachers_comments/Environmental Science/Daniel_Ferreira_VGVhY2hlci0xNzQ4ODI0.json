He breaks down the material so everyone can understand it, even with no prior Chemistry experience.

Posts all powerpoints online and has a powerpoint review with everything that is on the test. His homework helps you to learn the material, explains what to do if you get the problem wrong and why.

I'm a freshmen and took honors chem in high school and i got a A by simply going to his class and studying the week before the exam. He uses sapling hw so i literally used yahoo to do it all and it worked. easy quizzes. tests are pretty manageable as long as you do you part.

F is great. He obviously loves environmental science and will make you love it too. Make sure you know the power point material in his environmental classes because he give essay questions and you need to know what the hell your talk about. He can be strict on the essay questions.

Had him Fall 2012 for both lecture and lab.  He explains everything well and lets you know what you should have learned each day.  Go to class because he uses easy quizzes to take attendance.  His tests were not too bad, and the homework is online.  I received a B only because I was lazy toward the end of the semester.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTM2Mzkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENVSCIENCE","date_posted":"2013-04-30 20:25:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"I like the class.

He begins each class with an overview of the objectives for that day, and ends each class by summarizing the lecture. He keeps track of attendance with easy quizzes that are a free A.
