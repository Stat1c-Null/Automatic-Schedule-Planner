She starts out her lecture very to the point and then gets side tracked as soon as she begins one of her infinite stories from working the field. Dont get me wrong, theyre usually fascinating although unnecessary. Definitely go to the review sessions held by the department head and itll be easier","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Mzc1MzUw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSH2500","date_posted":"2016-12-05 20:30:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is lively and LOUD. Tests are clearly based on her study guides. All multiple choice and super easy if you study the study guides. Homework and one big project but are pretty easy. All the online quizzes can be found on quizlet/online. Don't really need to go to class but she takes attendance five times randomly through the semester.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzQxNzM2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2500","date_posted":"2016-12-01 10:36:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"She wasn't necessarily a bad teacher, she just was ALL over the place. She hated when people asked her about her grading, she was scatter brained, she wasn't able to answer peoples' questions properly, her tests were all over the place. Just read the book and you should  be fine. Don't pay TOO much attention to her PowerPoints.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Mjk3MDY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
