She has no structure to her assignments and she grades harshly which is not fair bc she never says how the work should be done . I recommend a different professor bc you dont want a easy class like this to bring your GPA down.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDYwMzU2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSH4680","date_posted":"2017-12-01 13:21:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"i took this class as an elective and it was a mistake. her quizes are only 4 questions and cover anywhere from 4 to 6 different chapters at once and she doesnt give any hints to what will be on them. it takes her FOREVER to get your grades back and doesnt answer emails. the class material itself isnt that hard but she makes it. choose another prof","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDEyNjE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
