However, if you attend all of his classes and tastings you should pass all the tests. There is a group project and a two restaurant reports. This class has tons of work but super easy.

Chef (Professor Jolis) is chill &amp; doesn't make anything harder than it needs to be. Easy A for sure, but make sure to come to class because you'll lose points for each absence - excused or unexcused. I had to miss one class for a funeral, I told him prior to it, &amp; I still lost points.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjU2Njc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2200","date_posted":"2017-11-30 17:24:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy class, great professor. Attendance, tasting quizzes, restaurant reports (3 pages), group presentation (which includes a 5-page paper and 12 minute powerpoint), and tasting journal are the main grades. There's a final and a midterm, but they're not hard. Some of the assignments seem mediocre but it's an easy A so do it for your GPA.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDA0NDYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--SO MANY PAPERS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2300","date_posted":"2017-10-06 14:27:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor - absolutely there to teach.

Overall, good course, laid back lectures, easy quizzes and exams. I suggest getting the book just to explore more, some of the dishes you're going to want to recreate. 1 thing, he speaks a lot about Christopher Columbus... i'll leave it at that.

He loves telling stories about his life, and they're really interesting; this guy has done a lot in this life. You eat food from different regions and write 1 page journals. Quizzes sometimes.

He makes the class enjoyable and \"easy\" by providing the useful notes that correspond with what you are being tested on. No tricks, he wants you to do well. Love, love, love him!
