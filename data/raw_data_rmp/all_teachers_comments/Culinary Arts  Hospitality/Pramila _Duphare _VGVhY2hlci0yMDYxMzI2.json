All she does is read off her power points and the tests are REALLY hard. She crams way too much material into one test and her study guides aren't helpful at all. Coming to class is a waste of time because you basically teach yourself. Would not recommend this professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTQ1NTgy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

She mumbles and has a thick accent. She doesn't do anything except read off the power points and then she doesn't make the test or quizzes. They are super hard and you have no idea what to study for because even if you make 100 on all practice quizzes multiple times you still will fail.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTI5MzM1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSH2500","date_posted":"2016-10-25 23:11:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"obviously extremely smart & knows what she's talking about. But when it comes to teaching, not very skilled. Lectures straight from powerpoints, boring & rants about things NOT on the test. Crams as much material into a test as she can. READ THE BOOK. STUDY A LOT& forget about trying to email her. its clear she doesn't care about students success.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDc5NDAz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSH2500","date_posted":"2015-11-09 19:29:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Duphare tries to cram a million things onto one test. The information she teaches is not very clear, especially because most of the time ranting. She does not respond well to emails and her only advice ever is \"look on d2l.\" She does not seem to care about student success. I would not recommend.
