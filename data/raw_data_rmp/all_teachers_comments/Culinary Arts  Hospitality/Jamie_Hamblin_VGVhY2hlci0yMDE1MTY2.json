She's passionate about nutrition, but this was her first semester teaching so we were her guinea pigs. Tests were super hard even though she reviewed. Lots of easy homework and extra credit opportunities. She likes group activities, but not graded projects. One final project at the end of the semester and 3 big tests.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODI2Nzcx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
