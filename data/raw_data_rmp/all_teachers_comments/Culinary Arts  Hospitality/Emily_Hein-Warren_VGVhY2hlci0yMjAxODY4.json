Attend class and you'll do really well. The lectures are fairly simple and directly correlate with the book. She has lots of real-world experience in the subject so the class materials are useful and applicable to real-life situations. She's also very accessible outside the classroom via phone for any questions.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTM0OTMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH4660","date_posted":"2017-03-30 16:17:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Hein is awesome. I have her for event management and my Sustainable Design class. She uses plenty of real world examples so you can better understand the material and so lectures aren't boring.
