The tests and quizzes are tough even if you study, but it you do all the tasting notes you'll be fine. Don't miss class or you won't have tasting notes for that day and worse, you won't get to taste anything.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MzkwMzMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tests are tough","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH4630","date_posted":"2017-11-15 12:13:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Kren is awesome. He is passionate about the course, and has no problem futher disucssing anything with you. In my experience, he has a sense of humor and appreciates if you do, too. Towards the end of the course, he takes the class out for a private brewery tour (for beer) and a sushi dinner (for sake) to learn about costs and parings.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTAzNzgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH4630","date_posted":"2016-05-05 00:49:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Kren is awesome. There are 5 quizzes but each one you get a lightening round to let you know what is on them, as well as the midterm and final. They are a little tough but you'll be fine if you study. The tastings are fun and he makes it to where everyone in the class are basically friends. I would most def. take him again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDczMTE0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH4630","date_posted":"2016-04-11 17:45:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loved this class so much. It's very easy if you take notes and actively participate in his lightning round reviews. I learned so much and it ended up being my favorite class of the semester. Definitely recommend taking the class with Professor Kren.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjcyNjEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
