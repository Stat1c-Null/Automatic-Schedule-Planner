He is very caring and understanding and will do everything in his power to give you all the tools you need to do well in his class. His tests are a bit tricky, but if you go to class and pay attention to lectures and read the book, you will do fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTE1OTU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH4630","date_posted":"2016-05-01 14:54:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hands down my favorite professor! You need to study in his class, but the subject is fun, and friends are easy to make. I made great connections & bonded with other students. I learned so much that I''m proud to discuss outside of class. This class gave me a greater appreciation for spirits instead of just throwing it back its enjoyed. 100%Worth it","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDI4NTAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2100","date_posted":"2016-01-10 21:07:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Marvil is awesome. One of the best CSH profs in the lot. Tons of experience in the industry, tons of knowledge about many things. He will sometimes let you redo assignments that you screw up or will reopen missed quizzes. His tests and quizzes are a but tricky, he pulls questions directly from the text & not often from lectures, so you HAVE to read","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTE0MzEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2100","date_posted":"2015-12-10 20:54:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Total snooze fest!! The only time he was interesting was when the other professor was there. If you don't go to class just make sure you read the book and speakers bios these are where test and quiz questions all come from.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NjM2MzE1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2100","date_posted":"2015-12-10 17:07:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Go to class! You will not pass this class if you don't. The guest speakers he provided were amazing and very informative, but you will not pass this class for the many quizzes you will take if you do not read the book. He is a very nice professor, but he is very tough with grading, attendance, and participation.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NjMyMDMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
