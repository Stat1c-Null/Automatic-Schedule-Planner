Class is easy and fun, obviously you have to be there because you're baking but it's so worth it. Plus he makes side meals for the class to sample.

First time teaching baking. He's super nice and really cares for his students. The ONLY criticism I have about the class is sometimes he would give us 4-5 things to bake in one class, and it got a little bit hectic and we didn't always finish on time. If you love baking/cooking, take his class! He's a wonderful professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzQyMDIz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2300","date_posted":"2015-12-23 12:44:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"CSH 2300 (05) - Basic Culinary Skills.
