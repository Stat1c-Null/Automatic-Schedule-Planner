You won't use the textbook that much, and he will tell you what you need to look out for. He is willing to work with you, as long that you put effort in it as well. I would like to another one of his classes when I have the chance.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzI0NjA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2300","date_posted":"2017-05-13 17:36:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Chef Adam Joseph his very friendly.

He wants you to succeed and truly cares. He's very funny, open and keeps things real. This program needs more like Chef Joseph! Don't let the course fool you- it's not just how to boil water or scramble eggs. It's hands-on, difficult and the ServSafe test is tough; but it's also fun, challenging and fast paced.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjU1MDUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2300","date_posted":"2016-11-30 18:28:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Chef Adam is fantastic.  He's hysterical and makes class so much fun.  However, he also teaches well.  You go into class knowing what's expected of you.  He's super understanding, and just an all around awesome guy.  Would definitely take him again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjkwNDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2300","date_posted":"2016-04-20 21:47:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Chef Adam is awesome. He's hilarious and really knows what he's doing in the kitchen. There are ServSafe quizzes first, then quizzes from the book. He's very helpful and sweet. Class is very involved, so go to each class. I had a lot of fun in his class and learned a lot more than I thought I would. Easy as long as you show up! Take this class!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzQyMTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
