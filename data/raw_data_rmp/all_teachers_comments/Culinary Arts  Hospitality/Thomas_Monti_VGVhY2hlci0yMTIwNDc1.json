We had to do a weird group project that didn't have anything to do with brewing, because he wanted the university president to come to it (the pres. skipped it anyway).  Stay away from this class, even if you like beer/brewing a lot.  You learn nothing more than what's in his or other online videos.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTgyOTkx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
