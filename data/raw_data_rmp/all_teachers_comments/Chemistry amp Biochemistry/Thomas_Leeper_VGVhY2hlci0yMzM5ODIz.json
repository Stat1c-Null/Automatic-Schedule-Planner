The key is to keep up with lectures and quizzes, which come from book content. Class is not challenging if you actually take your time to understand the material. Dr. Leeper is always willing to help his students succeed in the course. He is very enthusiastic when lecturing.

However, he gives you the opportunity to succeed and is 100% fair when it comes to grades/projects. He genuinely cares about his students (takes time to see it) and does give helpful criticism. Be respectful and you shouldnt have too many issues.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNDAzMTI0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

Read the chapters because he assigns quizzes for almost every chapter. Each quiz has three attempts and it's worth 10 points of your grade. Some of his exams have questions from the quizzes so write them out! DO NOT STAY BEHIND. Catching up is killer and very overwhelming. Overall, great professor and accessible outside of class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTQzNzM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

That sucks, but the first two exams aren't bad. Final replaces your lowest test, and a B and C are like a 78 and a 65. An A is challenging, but it's pretty much a B or C otherwise. Highly recommend!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODY4NTQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM3500","date_posted":"2018-04-22 18:33:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Yes, biochem is hard by nature and Leeper can't do anything about it, but he tries his best to make sure everyone is doing well. Lowered grading scale (B is a 78, C is a 65) 3 exams, and lowest is replaced by final. One thing to know, his 3rd is exam is 27 CHAPTERS! My advice, do well on first 2 (not hard) and replace lowest with final.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODYyMjU3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
