She responded to my emails sooo fast and her explanations were so good. Pay attention to her pre-lab lecture, she gives a lot of helpful tips on the experiment and how to do lab report.

She is a Grad student but she is amazing and really wants you to do well! She helped me so much and I thought I was going to fail but emailing and asking her for help made me pull up my grade so much and get A on final!
