However it was setup in a previous semester. Basically you just read to the book and follow the tutorial to learn the material. Took a long time to get grades back, which means you completed many assignments before any feedback was given. Not a bad class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzcwMDM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ME4202","date_posted":"2020-12-09 00:09:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"take him if you seriously want to learn, my group worked our a off to get A in his classes and not regret a second of it. if you want to be another snowflake and expect an easy core engineering class which taught by one of the top guys of the department, dont waste his time and leave that spot for someone who willing to learn","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTkyMTk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME4202","date_posted":"2020-07-16 00:34:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"He has zero soft skills. He is rude and condescending when giving what he calls &quot;feedback,&quot; and doesn't have the industry experience to be overseeing SD projects. Instead of being inspirational, he is the type of professor that makes people switch from engineering to business. I'm glad I won't have to see him ever again.
