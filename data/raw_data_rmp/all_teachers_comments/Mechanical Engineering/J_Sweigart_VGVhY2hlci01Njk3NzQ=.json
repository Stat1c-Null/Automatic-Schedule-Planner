He is a kind older guy with a tremendous amount of knowledge about the subjects he teaches, but sometimes has a hard time teaching. I would not take him again strictly for that reason. If you ever need info about something he has it.

My advice is to focus a lot of time on the fundamental problems in the textbook.  The test and Quiz problems will be more difficult than these but it will help to understand the concept.  Remain calm and think logically.  Test and quiz problems are usually from the book.  He curves at the end.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDkwNjg3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MET3126","date_posted":"2017-04-25 16:08:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice enough guy, but he's not a good teacher. I've had him for 3 different classes and they've all been the same. Come to class, pay attention, do homework, then you still don't understand it. He's just not very good at teaching the subjects although he knows them like the back of his hand (for the most part). Avoid him if you can.....

So if you're allowed a formula sheet, quadruple check it only has allowed formulae. He is always retracting and busting your ass for points.

Homework is necessary to do well in class and lecture. Lab reports are long. Very few grades in class (2-5), so tests and final are the most important.
