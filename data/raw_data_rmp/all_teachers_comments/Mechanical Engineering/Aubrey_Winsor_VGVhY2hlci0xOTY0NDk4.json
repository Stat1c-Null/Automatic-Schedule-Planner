Spends too much time in class trying to make jokes or talking about irrelevant things, then rushes through the actual CAD modeling that would be useful to learn how to do. Goes off on rants about random things. One of the worst professors I've had. Take a different professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTg1MTM4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":10,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG1211","date_posted":"2015-03-18 20:42:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Grades insanely hard on hand drawn assignments and gives little to NO FEEDBACK whatsoever on why you received the grade you did. May or may not be on meth. If possible, do not take him. Conrey or Como either one would be a much better choice.

Eccentric, entertaining, witty, .... characteristics that fit him. You will never be more entertained in a lecture.  Even though you may laugh, pay attention. Take advantage of office hours to get help with assignments. Go to class or you will fail. Lots of work, but worth it.
