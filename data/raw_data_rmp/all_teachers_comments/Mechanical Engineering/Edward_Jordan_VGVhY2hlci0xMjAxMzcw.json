I'm not sure who though. Boring lectures(just reads out of book), disappointing class. Mr. Jordan dosen't seem to have any kind of schedule for the material (We spent 3 just weeks in the machining lab) My advise, take the class that meets more than once per week.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjE1OTU0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MET1321","date_posted":"2011-12-27 13:27:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"This Professor is not that bad...He is very slow talking his lectures are pretty much nap time but lab is interesting he is always there to help.

He is VERY VERY helpful. He is also very nice and really funny. He will help you with anything and is probably the most helpful teacher of all time. He's great at what he does and loves teaching about it.
