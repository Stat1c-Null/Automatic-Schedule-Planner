His test really make you utilize all the knowledge gained over the series of lectures (not cumulative). Usually gets bombarded with questions at the end of class but answers all before leaving. Knowledgeable on the tools used. Laid back personality but a hardworker","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDI3ODA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?

The assignments do stack up if their not done or printed out right the first time. The class is more interesting than other Engineering classes because you are actually making and using tools of the industry. There is also a research paper that he requires but other than that its a straight forward class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjcyMDE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MET2322","date_posted":"2013-12-15 09:54:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor, I've taken him for Graphics 1, Machining and welding, and CNC and metrology.
