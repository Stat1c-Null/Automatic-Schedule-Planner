Plus he is very unreasonable about grading, and getting him to change your grade is a nightmare. He hates to admit when he is wrong. You get your tests back for about 3 minutes and he takes them right back up. So figuring out if the was a grading error is very difficult.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDAwMzA3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"THERM3410","date_posted":"2011-11-22 12:40:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall, He is a good professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5Mjk3Nzc2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
