One other problem is she takes the lab SO seriously. machine wouldnt make the member fail, so we sat for 3 hours until time for class was up. yes we had to sit there and watch a piece of steel rotate for 3 hours. She needs to understand it is a 1 hour credit course.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTE4MDY0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
