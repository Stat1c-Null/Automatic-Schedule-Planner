He writes super small and illegible on the board and talks at a low volume.  He doesn't explain things well, most of the class is just him scribbling down random equations without him telling you what they solve for.  Do not take.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mzg0NjU0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2006-03-27 08:31:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"I made a B. The class seemed easy to me at first. I did the homework and got Aâ€™s on the first 3 tests by studying the homework. The topics covered at the end of the course required integration, something I had forgotten or never had. I bombed the last test and the final but still got a B. Stephenson is dry but fair. Ask for an integration review.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExNjE2ODE1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
