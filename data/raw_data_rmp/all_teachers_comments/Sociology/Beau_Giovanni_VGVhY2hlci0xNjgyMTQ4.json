Likes to play a \"guessing game\" with students with ethnic names. Usually off topic and picks irrelevant material from the book for his tests that he doesn't focus on in class. Basically read and hope you focused on the right material for the test. A bit like Russian Roulette.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjUzMDUw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2201","date_posted":"2012-05-10 08:44:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor.

Not very consistent with how he says he tests and does study guides. Takes material right from the book, i suggest actually reading it. Tests were generally short answer, but easy. Easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzAxNjU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
