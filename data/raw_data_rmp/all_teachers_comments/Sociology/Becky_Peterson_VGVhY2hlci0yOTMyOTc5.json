Take lots of notes and read the book. Keep up with your assignments and you'll do fine. If you're an avid skipper don't take her because attendance is mandatory. Also don't be late or you'll be counted absent. 10/10 recommend!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjkwNjQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
