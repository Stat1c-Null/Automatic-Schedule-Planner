There are one questions quizzes on every chapter of the book (which are generally super easy to find the answer to). The tests were directly from the book and went in order of the chapters, so they were fairly easy to find the answers to. Watch out for some of the confusing deadlines as they were often outdated.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDMyOTY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3300","date_posted":"2018-05-05 00:01:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the worst instructors I've ever had. Regularly got information wrong in the lectures and test questions. Slow to grade, and I think he didn't actually read the papers when grading, so you don't get constructive feedback. Not very well-spoken or articulate, but makes you listen to his video lectures - no text/PPT notes available.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTkyNjg3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"SO MANY PAPERS--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SOCI3300","date_posted":"2017-12-13 08:22:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy class, one response paper a week about a topic he gives.

He warns you that the class is hard, but it really isn't. He gives 1 paper a week that is 1-2 pages over the chapter, but he does a video lecture each week and basically tells you what to say. He gives you list of TEST QUESTIONS! So you basically can complete all the short answer questions and copy and paste them.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTkwNTQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3300","date_posted":"2017-11-29 14:31:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Online Class, but unlike any online class Ive taken so far. 2 random discussion posts, 1 weekly reading assignment, no word limit on your paper, you just have to make sure he knows you read and understood what he assigned.

He takes FOREVER to grade. 5 discussions, 5 journals, midterm, final and project. He often forgets to update paperwork with the correct dates too. The only good thing is that on more heavily weighted items (exams, project which in total count for 70%), he seems to be very lenient.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjAwMzQ1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2251","date_posted":"2016-10-30 21:17:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took the online Social Problems with Mr. Irvin, and I would definitely take another one of his classes.
