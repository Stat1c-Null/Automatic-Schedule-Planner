If you look over the notes and power points before the test and midterm you should be fine. Her concept of reviews before hand was a little strange. She does try her best to provide examples that every student in the class can relate to.

She also put our grades in almost 3 weeks after the class was over.

Uses good examples to connect the real world to the lecture. Her lectures are very easy to follow and she explains things very well. Attendance is not mandatory but should be treated like it is. Midterm and final came mostly from the powerpoints and pop quizzes came from articles in her book. Easy A if you do the work.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzY2NTQy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2105","date_posted":"2015-11-04 10:26:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would recommend Prof Ward anyday! She is very funny in her teachings, her examples are modern, distinct, and easy to follow, and her tests are extremely simple! She also is willing to do a review before your midterm so you know what to study. The book you need for the class is also written by her, which is pretty cool. I definitely recommend her!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzM5NjI2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3314","date_posted":"2014-12-18 20:53:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Ward is an amazing professor!

She has the capability to be entertaining, but oftentimes she opts to read off of the power points which makes for pretty dry lectures. Super easy writing assignments (basically a completion grade) and the Midterm wasn't too bad.
