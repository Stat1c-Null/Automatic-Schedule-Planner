He's very scattered but i managed an A and barely read. So he's better than most.

His lectures are repetitive and convoluted, and he spent a good fourth of class time lecturing about class participation and \"being nice to him\". Every. Single. Day. It's an easy A if you go to class, but be prepared to sit through an extremely painful lecture.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDg0OTI5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2105","date_posted":"2014-12-12 12:11:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very knowledgeable about the subject and cares very much about teaching and his students. A little unclear about what will be on the quizzes but be safe and study everything on the power pointsread the book. 3 quizzes and a final and he drops the lowest quiz grade.

Barely understood, not helpful when you come to him one on one, and doesn't respond to emails. 3 test, but doesn't help prepare you for them. Teaches 3 classes this semester and all 3 classes have reported him to the chair of sociology. Avoid at all cost!!!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzODI0ODQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2205","date_posted":"2014-11-06 19:11:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Please, do not take him. He was a very kind person, but his lack of organization and clarification were truly frustrating. The schedule was a joke, lectures were repetitive, tests were confusing and often contained many incorrect answers, he rarely stuck to his word, miscalculated grades often, and essentially did not know how to teach a class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzYxMzA5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
