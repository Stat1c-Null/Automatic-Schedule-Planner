Quizzes are easy if you do the reading and take the online practice quiz. Short papers and she tries to give you a variety of topics.  You are allowed 1 page of notes for tests, they are not cumulative.  I would take her class again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTQxMDgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2201","date_posted":"2012-01-10 00:55:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved Professor Allison! She was one of the easiest teachers I've had in my college career. 10 quizzes, lowest one is dropped, fairly easy tests, and easy essays. She also give extra credit. She let us bring notes to the test, and I consistently made 90's and a 100 on the final.You actually learn things if you attend. Great teacher!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzAwNjAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOC2201","date_posted":"2011-12-18 22:02:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"RACHEL ALLISON!

Teaching wise, she is a good teacher. Keeps class interested, gives a lot of extra credit. You can use one page of notes for each exam/mid term. Final you can have endless notes. She does give 10 random quizzes... So make sure you do reading for every class and practice quizzes. I would definitely take her again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjE2ODgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCIO2201","date_posted":"2011-11-09 13:38:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class is very boring. attendence isnt mandatory but she gives 10 random quizzes.

New to KSU. Not sure how experienced she is. She uses filler words &quot;like, umm, right&quot; all the time-Annoying! Reading Summaries-1 full pg paper due every day of class. Huge hard midterm over all the readings & no final. Sometimes activities but beats a topic to a bush. Lectures are off ppt & are boring.
