Interesting topic but, No time in class for discussions, most questions asked are answered by \" I am not sure\".No study guide for test that covers so much material.

I recommend getting the book cause her powerpoint don't cover everything that will be on the test. Test are unclear and she does not provided study guides.

You do not have class the day she assigns the writing assignment and are given plenty of time to complete it. would take again","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzQzMzE2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2105","date_posted":"2015-11-04 20:48:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Yates is a good teacher and she's well versed in her material. She answers questions in class and is generally helpful. She runs through notes very quickly but she posts them online afterwards. Beware of unannounced reading quizzes. Tests are fairly easy, they're in class, and she allowed us to rewrite two of them for a set amount of questions.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQ1NjE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3360","date_posted":"2015-11-03 19:10:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Couldn't stand this class. There was no point to showing up besides the attendance quizzes, which were easy enough to be fair. She teaches word for word from the book and seemed angry with us most of the time. Skip her.

She gives 3 tests, & she let our class do \"test re-writes\" on 2 of them. She does make you do a pretty simple group project that she explain at the very beginning of the semester. She's sassy, to the point and nice. The class itself is a bit bland but she's does her job well.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MjgyOTUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3360","date_posted":"2015-10-07 10:09:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Boring. Reads directly from power points, no discussions whatsoever. Will give you an 8 page study guide for test with 35 Q's; why even bother, study both (txtbk & course reading) books and hope you know it, jut like her quizzes. Let her tell it, \"you are in college\". Class may be interesting if it wasn't for her, She cant answ Q's  w/o  lectures.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MjMzNDAw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
