There were discussions weekly along with lab papers, and 2 papers as a midterm and final. The class is not difficult but there is a good amount of work. Professor Keever provides clear guidelines and rubrics, so as long as you do the work you are guaranteed an A.

Includes mild reading and mostly just discussion posts and simple quizzes. There are a few writing assignments, but really all that matters is the word count.

I really enjoyed the content of the class plus she drops the lowest score for each category and her exams are straight from the textbook. She gave great feedback so it made me want to try with these assignments. You do need to be a good writer for most of her assignments but its no too bad.

You need to be a good writer as there are many essays and discussions but common sense will get you pretty far in this class. She drops the lowest grade in each category and her exams are open note.

Prof Keever is extremely direct and this helped me to follow her rubrics because they are exactly what she expected. As long as you meet deadlines and follow directions from the syllabus you will pass.

However, she has a very condescending attitude and is often rude when trying to email her. All instructions are very vague and she makes it seem like a chore to answer your emails asking for clarification. Easy class but the professor makes it harder than it needs to be. Wouldnt take again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTEwMTY5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
