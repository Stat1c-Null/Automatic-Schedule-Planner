Final exam was optional (only replaced quiz grades). Lectures were packed but his energy makes it easy to get through. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDI4MTky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI1101","date_posted":"2023-08-01 18:40:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"The textbook is definitely necessary.

He responds to emails quickly. He grades projects fairly and the tests aren't too difficult as long as you study. We had 2 tests the whole semester and one project. Attendance is 20% of your grade, so make sure to go to class.
