Assigns three conflicting theories in the form of  100$ text that are NOT qualitative. Very opinionated and not open-minded. Needs people and teaching skills. Assigned quizzes every day, having up to 20 questions only offering 10 minutes time. One cumulative final exam (1 hr long).","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzI2Mzcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3360","date_posted":"2015-03-19 13:36:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"New teacher.

I had to end up dropping the class. She is not specific at all in what she expects in assignments. She makes assignments look simple if you just follow the rubric, but then docks off points for things that aren't even on the rubric.

However this teacher is crazy with the amount of homework, she would require two discussion post due by 7pm the night before the next class. Also, she would bash your questions if they did not meet her standards.

She is super strict about even having a phone out on a desk even if it is turned over, she will call you out to remove it from your desk.
