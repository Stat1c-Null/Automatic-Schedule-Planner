Lecture is kind of boring, all he does is read off of the PowerPoint slides, but as long as you pay attention and take a few notes, you should do fine. He is very helpful and understanding. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzQwNzQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
