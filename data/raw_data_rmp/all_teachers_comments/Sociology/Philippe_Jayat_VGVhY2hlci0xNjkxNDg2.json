Likes to be friendly as possible and he appreciates interaction in class and will give bonus for lots of interaction. tests are easy and journals are opinions. best prof.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODgxODUw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2105","date_posted":"2012-11-14 16:11:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"grades consist of two journals and three tests. the journals are one to two page papers. he doesn't really look over them, which means it should be an easy grade. each test is over three chapters. he uses power points as notes. he moves fast, but his tests are his exact notes. easy class if you take notes and study them!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODM1MDI3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2201","date_posted":"2012-04-30 23:08:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was my favorite for the semester! He is super nice and it is an easy class! If looking for an easy grade then take his class! Only grades are 3 or 4 tests and a few journal entries. He tells you what to study for the tests and lets you turn the journals in whenever. Very laid-back. His French accent is also amazing!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTYwMDIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2201","date_posted":"2012-03-21 11:37:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's very nice and the class is easy. He'll tell you the class period before the test exactly what to study and even gives out a bank of essay questions that the test essay questions will come from. Lecture is a little boring, but worth going to for the notes. PPTs aren't online.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTMyMTQz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2201","date_posted":"2012-02-03 09:36:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Love his class. It's more about discussion and some people have a difficult time with that.
