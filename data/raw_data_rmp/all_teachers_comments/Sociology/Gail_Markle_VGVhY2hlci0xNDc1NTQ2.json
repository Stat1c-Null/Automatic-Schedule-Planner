Attendance is required though. You can miss two classes without being penalized. Gives you study guides before each tests - straight off her powerpoints - so go to class. Book use was minimal.I would still recommend buying it. Overall great experience and interesting class!

Tests are hard, but nothing studying can't solve. Always willing to help and will even study with you if you put in the time. I definitely plan on taking her again.
