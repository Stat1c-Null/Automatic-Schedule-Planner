I enjoyed going to class and she was pretty funny. Midterm, Final, and 5 HW assignments. Random quizzes to see if you read the chapter, but normally only if people don't discuss during class.

I'm not sure if she was distracted because she was also a student at the time or if she is just that bad.  She was unorganized and provided no uselful feed back to her students.
