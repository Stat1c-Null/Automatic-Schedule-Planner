He is raw and he does not sugar coat anything. If you are a cry baby or immature don't take the class. His lectures and teaching style may offend you but he wants you to be open minded.

He's a character...that's for sure! I enjoyed his class, but I felt like I really didn't learn anything substantial. It was entertaining though!
