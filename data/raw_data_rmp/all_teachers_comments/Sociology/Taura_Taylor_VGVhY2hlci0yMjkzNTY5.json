She was incredibly knowledgeable and relayed information in an easy-to-understand way. I was very hopeful for the class! After that first lecture though it was all self-directed learning.

Many discussions in this class, few outside assignments that involved certain topics they were never difficult. Super easy quizzes and no tests or exams.

There were no lectures for the class, just discussions, quizzes, and essays. Free online textbook. Test bank quizzes. None of the discussion/essay material is her own. Finished with a 98. Definitely my easiest class of the semester. The only thing is that she takes weeks/months to grade.

Some of her lectures went really fast and didn't really understand anything she talked about since she goes really fast. Tests are pretty easy, a lot of the info on tests are in the book.

Tests are a lot of vocab so all you really need to study is the review list she puts on D2L. She says we need the textbook but honestly you can def. get by without buying it.
