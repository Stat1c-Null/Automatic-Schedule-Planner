Do not take this class if you are sensitive to controversial political or social topics. Overall if you really enjoy sociology, you'll love this class but not my cup of tea. He will make sure you are participating and will call you out for the readings each week.  HEAVY group projects.

He listens to students opinions & does well to take constructive criticism when need be. (optional) students who miss class do a paper (super easy) & they get a 100 for attendance. a ton of extra credit at that he gives you time to complete. Even w/ racist students in our class, he held his composer, & remained unbiased","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTEwMDQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI1101","date_posted":"2022-04-21 15:55:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Said multiple sexist things such as, in reference to whether or not women could be \"alpha\" (ew), something along the lines of, \"Well, you didn't see women working on the railroads did you?\".

Professor Williams called people out to make sure the weekly reading was done. He really enjoys calling people out. Half the time, it's unknown what he means or what he is talking about.

This class is a joke. I was targeted for views he assumed I had. Got so bad his bias was dropping my grade, despite my participation.

You are in groups of 5ish. Everything is group work. He says he doesn't believe in &quot;busy work&quot;, but he assigns a ton of work. There are 20 vocab q's that have to be answered in paragraphs with citations and 3 or 4 chapter q's WEEKLY. This is on top of a bunch of presentation work.
