She does give pop quizzes but goes over the material in class before she gives the quiz.

McIntyre for PRESIDENT!!! NO TESTS!!! Just weekly summaries, a group presentation, and an 7-10 pg essay on the topic of your choices. I wish she could teach the rest of my Sociology classes. I love the way she laughs. She is too pretty to be a professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTM3NTg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3333","date_posted":"2014-05-01 00:22:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love this teacher.

I took the 8am class and never missed a day because I WANTED to hear her lecture. She gives you all the material you need for tests and gives extra credit opportunities. She is hilarious and gives examples that are very relatable. First prof. I've ever had that actually made me want to learn. TAKE HER!

Hilarious lectures and you'll actually want to go to class. Super nice and super understanding. Gives surprise quizzes that are extremely easy and raise your grade. NO tests are cummulative, so the tests are easy to study for. Loved this class.

Tests were simple and easy to study for. Pay attention to her references to pop culture-they are usually extra credit questions on the tests. She's obsessed with Queen, tell her you love Freddy Mercury. Focuses a lot on medicine and HIV/AIDS. Really funny. Does extra credit outside the tests","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTE5NDMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2105","date_posted":"2013-11-07 16:37:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really easy professor. If you pay attention in class and take notes you should easily get a B or higher. She's very engaging and often had open discussions with the class about current issues.
