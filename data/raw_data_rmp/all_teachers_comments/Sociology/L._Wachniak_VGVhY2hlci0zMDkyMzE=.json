You can talk about anything and everything! You can type up 10 multiple choice questions about the material as extra credit. Then she addes all the students questions as your study guide and those exact questions are the 2 tests. 1 5 pg. paper (start early she will edit it). Every class was a group discussion about taboo subjects!
