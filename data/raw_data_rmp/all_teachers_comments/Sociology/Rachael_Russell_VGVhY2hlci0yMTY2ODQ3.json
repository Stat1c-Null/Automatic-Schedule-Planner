Attendance is graded so show up for the grade, but if you just read the powerpoint lectures, you'll be okay. The quizzes aren't difficult, just keep up with the reading. Study quiz questions and answers for tests!

If not then I wouldn't recommend it.  You only have to complete so many out of the total homework assignments. She takes a long time to grade, though, and ended up grading the last few assignments for completion instead of content. Show up, pay attention, and you'll pass.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzEyOTU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

Nothing about the subject is difficult, you just have to turn in the one page papers. The film paper was so simple. And I got over a 100 on the final by just studying her PowerPoints. She does take centuries to put in grades though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjEzMDUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--SO MANY PAPERS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI1101","date_posted":"2016-12-21 23:05:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Russel is is very clear of what she expects. There are 22 CPA opportunities and you have to turn in at least 15 (they are one page responses to the readings and should be easy A's). The film review towards the end is worth 20% of your grade (easy A if you follow the rubric).

Those 1 page papers did get super annoying, but you only have to do 15 out of 22. If you study the power points, you should make an A. Without a doubt.

She's great. She does refrain from using gender pronouns because she doesn't want to offend or mislabel. She teaches from a sociologists perspective, not so much biased.
