His class is mandatory because he doesn't post powerpoints online, but lectures weren't bad. He does provide a free online textbook. It was 3 tests, two papers, some discussions.

He provides a textbook so you do not have to pay for one. However the only downside is that even though class is not mandatory, it is the only time you get notes.
