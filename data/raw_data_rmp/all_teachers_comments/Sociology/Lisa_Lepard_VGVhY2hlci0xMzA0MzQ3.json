She has a very dry sense of humor, which people seem to misread. The class is very eye opening and makes you look at things you might not have even thought about before. There's nothing particularly hard or unexpected, and it's a very interesting class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MjQ4NTQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2201","date_posted":"2011-01-21 01:44:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shes OK,not wow,but she knows her stuff.If she sees you make an effort for her class, she takes that into account.As for the class tests are based completely on txtbk, so buy it.Quizes,drops the lowest grade.About 6 easy assignments,no more than 1pg.If u read,do assgments& do well on tests u can pass.

She use to teach at West Ga. She was the worst teacher I have ever had. She goes off topic a lot. She does not speak with any enthusiasm, makes you question if she wants to be in her own class.
