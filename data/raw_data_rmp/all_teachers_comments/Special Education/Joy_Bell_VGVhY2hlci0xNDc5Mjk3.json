The hard part is figuring out what she wants on disc posts. I lost points bc I didn't support my post but did with quotes from book. Need to ask a ?? Good luck on getting response. Comm skills suck. She messed up my grades and put me as 0. Had to call several times to get her to fix it.

This is the fifth online course I have taken and by far the best designed online course. At first you may feel overwhelmed with everything, but after Week 3, you get in a flow. She is very up front about her guidelines and there are no surprises with her. Group projects are the toughest part of the course. Easy A if you try.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzQ5NTk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2010-09-27 22:46:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Heavy workload.
