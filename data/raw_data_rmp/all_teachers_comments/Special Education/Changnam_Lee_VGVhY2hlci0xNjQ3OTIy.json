His tests are tedious. Quizzes are easy. Can be very passive aggressive. VERY unclear directions/ due dates. I wanted to love this class but it is the least enjoyable for me :/","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTQ5NjU1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2012-10-22 12:24:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lee is a kind compassionate man, and has infinite patience! His tests were straight from his quizzes and guided notes. Requires that you write a few papers.

Lecture can be a little droning but he tries to clarify anything if you can't understand him. He can be a tough grader when it comes to assignments. He is a nice professor. Willing to help if you need it. Quizzes before each class are easy and really help for clarity, on tests, and overall grade.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTc2MTcz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2011-11-17 16:00:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you are passionate about Special Education, do not take him. He does not speak clear English, and his &quot;knowledge&quot; on the content comes directly from the textbook and his PowerPoints. Should not be a Professor at KSU; especially not teaching such an important course.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjY3MjY3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
