She is so passionate about her class and always made it fun to come to class. She has no deadlines, but gives you suggested deadlines to keep up, which I recommend you do. It was nice if you have a lot of other work in other classes though.

Tons of group projects! And I mean tons. Lots of presentations. I felt like Mrs. Williams didn't teach all that much, because we were always doing presentations!
