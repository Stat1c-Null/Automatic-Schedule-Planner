I took her my first semester as a grad student and have used things learned in this class more than any other. Has a non traditional teaching style, more mentor like but the class was one of the most informative in the program.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTMwMDM2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2013-12-12 23:12:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Brown is not clear on when assignments are due and what they are. It was a semester long frustration trying to figure her out as well as the material. As an Education major it is important that you learn a lot in these classes and it did not happen in her class. Try and find another professor for your sake and your future students sake.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTM0Mzg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2012-11-12 19:06:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Get ready to write....a LOT!  I took this class online.  There are tons of easy assignments that are time consuming and feel like busy work. Very frustrating.  No direction on how to prepare for Midterm, but it is fairly easy.  Several big papers and online group projects as well.  She is nice and slow to grade.  Easy but a ton of work.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE5OTcz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2010-05-08 17:05:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class online and got an 'A', but I had to work really hard. This class has a lot of small assignments that can be time consuming. Dr. Brown was really easy to communicate with if you had any questions. If you turned an assignment in and it was missing parts or not what she was looking for, she'd return it to you for a second chance.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTUzNTQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2010-05-04 23:23:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is SO disorganized and doesn't return grades.. its finals week and I still don't know half of my grades. I took this online and would not recommend it. I am not one to complain and I really do work hard, so trust me on this, I would much rather had a regular class with a teacher who actually made sense!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTIzMjUx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2010-04-15 12:34:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class online and it was an easy A.
