She is not preventative and waits for things to go wrong rather than taking the initiative to right them (ironic). She is not familiar with D2L and her students pay for it with their time. Forego the troubles and take LDRS3900 with someone else. 0/5 all across the board.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMjA1MTIx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"LDRS3900","date_posted":"2019-08-29 17:30:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Clayeux runs her online class from Wednesday to Monday. So instead of having a full week to do the work (like you do with most online courses) you have 3/4 days (unless you want to school on your weekends). She is largely absent and unresponsive to her students. If I didn't need this class, I would drop it. Don't take her. It isn't worth it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMjA0ODA3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
