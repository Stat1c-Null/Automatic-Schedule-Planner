This class is a small group discussion platform that does require heavy reading, but allows for alternate viewpoints and an in-depth analysis of the material that is hardly reached in other classes. Rian is amazing and, while intense, the class can be easy! Worth taking!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzc2ODUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS4490","date_posted":"2012-05-07 18:21:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"All-in-all this is a great course with a very knowledgable, intelligent, and passionate professor. He is fair. Books are required and you will do HEAVEY reading. This instructor has a habit of asking simple/general questions and expects you to expand greatly. Be careful about assignment: content, depth, accuracy, citations, spelling, & grammar!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjE5MzY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
