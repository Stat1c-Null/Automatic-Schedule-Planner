She does not explain what she expects well and grades very harshly. When you ask questions expect her to be rude. I am also in the thrive recognition program which she over sees. When I submit documents it takes at least a year to get them approved and thats after having to email a lot.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNDQxNzE0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-11-09 09:06:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shae helped me get my college life together! I was oblivious to many issues with my organizational skills and productivity skills, and she has fixed those completely. She also showed me the easiest way to sign up for classes, which helped me beat the crowd! 10/10 Would recommend","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjkyMzM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-12-23 17:30:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hard grader and very bad explainer. Gives ONE TEST the entire semester and it is a midterm. No study guide whatsoever. Takes DIRECT QUOTES randomly from previous readings and places them in the test, asking you to finish the quote with the correct words. Expect to never get a 100 on any assignment because homework she grades hard.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MzI1NzM5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--Tests are tough","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
