She's super easy to talk to and form a relationship with. The class does require some work, but it's nothing that will take up too much of your time. She'll grade you easier if you show her that you take the class seriously.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Mzc3Nzg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-12-12 16:39:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Calhoun is so sweet and she cares about you as a student. She is very understanding when it comes to grades and if you do the work that she gives you will make a 100 on everything. There are a lot of projects but there are a few that are really helpful as a freshman. I suggest taking her for an easy class and an easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTU2ODQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-11-29 01:10:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shes active and helpful, almost like shes your counslor. The class is easy just tedious and mostly on the busy work side of things due to the nature of the course.

I'd rather have a professor that knows what she's talking about. At the same time, it's kind of nice, since she's really lenient and doesn't quite know what she's doing yet. She's really nice and understanding, though, and cares about her students. Overall a nice woman.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODY1NDU1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
