She graded me fairly and let me speak my mind.  She is great, but don't be afraid to speak, challenge her.  She is also sharp, have your ducks in a row if you are going to challenge her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTQ4NDIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"AADS1102","date_posted":"2014-05-07 15:38:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Yow is the perfect teacher. She cares about her students and the course material, and she works very hard to help the students learn.  She's not pedantic. She provides a balanced and objective perspective of the course material.  She is all about helping her students learn and improve. When she corrects a student she helps them truly develop.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTg4NDkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"AMST1102","date_posted":"2014-01-06 17:38:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class seemed like a ton of work when it started, but turned out to be one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken. You may have to remind her its an 1100 level class and we don't all read these books for fun, but overall she's a great professor, and I cant recommend this class enough.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzA2NTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"AMST1102","date_posted":"2013-12-20 00:13:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"I thought I wouldn't like her or this class at first, but I was wrong! She's very understanding- shes a new teacher so she relies on our feedback. Lowered the coursework once we told her it was too much for a gen ed course. Go to class, participate in the discussions, and you will be fine! I definitely recommend her!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjIyNjU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"AMST1102","date_posted":"2013-11-20 18:32:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"LOVE HER!!!!
