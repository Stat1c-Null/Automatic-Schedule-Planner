Everything is through Cengage with easy quizzes. Some assignments are difficult but it's nothing a little googling won't help you with. Tests are hard, but there are only two. Take advantage of the multiple extra credit opportunities and you'll be fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTE1NDU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2015-10-23 12:06:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Trammell is great. This is a mandatory class for graduation, so if you're just looking for an easy class, she is a good professor to choose. There are only a few tests and a final, some random group projects, 1 global essay paper and that's it. It's pretty easy. Missing the class every once in a while is fine. She's super friendly too.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mjg0ODAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2011-11-18 13:25:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this professor! She's really nice. Easy grader. She is understanding about your personal life outside of the class. Tests are a little tricky but not if you read the chapters! TAKE HER! Shes awesome!

Gives tons of work. Easier Grader. Test are not cumlative. The first test is hard after that the test are much easier. She gives extra credit. Do not have to buy the book as long as you do spark notes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzQxMzA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
