These readings are very long but the quizzes are pretty straightforward short answer questions. Her lectures are boring. Shes a super nice person but gives too much work. Theres a family history project that is pretty extensive. Overall a good person but too much work","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njg3OTYz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
