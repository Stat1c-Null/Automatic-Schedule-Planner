Via KSU's own book covering what to expect as a freshmen, he provides presentations (most with guest speakers). Interaction with other students is a major part of this class and can be a bit frustrating when you're grouped with slackers.

The work is very minimal; If you don't get an \"A\" you don't have a pulse. Class usually gets out really early. TAKE HIM!!! Also, he loves to talk about Georgia tech and his personal life.
