Fair grader, responds quickly to emails and very transparent (everything on the syllabus is what is covered exactly in class). Discussion posts every week, midterm, final, 2 article reviews and an organizational assessment paper. Keep up every week and you will do just fine.

He wants you to do well and it shows. For writing assignments, he clearly explains the expectations. You just have to do the work. No excuse not to do well in this course. Expect a good deal of reading and writing. Very straightforward.

He is a true Servant Leader, serving his students. He is truly dedicated to helping you learn. If you want to truly grow as a human, this is the Professor. Feedback was amazing.
