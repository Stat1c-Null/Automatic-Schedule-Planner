She is understanding though. I have always had a hard time with math so maybe that is why I did not understand it all but I felt like she did not explain well enough and she would not explain problems a lot because she wants you to think about it, but if I have no idea how to do it I would like it explained","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTg1Mzcx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3316","date_posted":"2012-04-30 15:20:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher explains problems several ways.

She has high expectations and you will work hard to earn your grade. I learned more in this class than any other math class I have ever taken. I don't think I would have passed the GACE without this class. She responded to my emails quickly any time I had questions.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzAxNTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3318","date_posted":"2011-04-12 13:31:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"By far one of the poorest experiences I've had. Her teaching style is hard to follow and she comes off quite condescending. Her exams were outrageously difficult. I do NOT recommend this teacher.

She is a strict grader but she is not unfair, she takes off points for things that may confuse a student.

They're very open ended and she requires a lot of writing and explanations for problems. There are a lot of homework grades (she grades for accuracy), quizes, and other grades, not just tests which can be good and bad! Overall it was difficult but I'd take her again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTYzMDM5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3317","date_posted":"2010-05-08 07:51:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is knowledgeable, & she does hands on learning. HOWEVER, her grading is strict and test questions can be unclear. Be prepared to be able to know &quot;something covered in class that is not on this test&quot;!
