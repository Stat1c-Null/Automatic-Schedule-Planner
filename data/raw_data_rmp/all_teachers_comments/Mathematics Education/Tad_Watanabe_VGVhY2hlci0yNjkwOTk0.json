He will not work with you and give you good grades for trying, you have to do the work. I feel as though he over complicates things & I would 1000% no recommend anyone take him at all.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDc0NTQ0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"D+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Beware of pop quizzes--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2023-05-03 15:55:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Wantanabe was an extremely difficult professor for me. He does not tend to give assistance or take the time to help you understand the content. You get one lecture and then hopefully if you have any questions you can figure them out yourself.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODA1MTg2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"F","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2023-04-27 15:17:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"You need to do a lot of teaching yourself type work in this class. I used all of his examples that he posts to teach myself the material. I don't recommend taking this professor for this class. He rushes through things and will not explain things if you ask a question. He uses quizzes as a form of attendance and never tells you what your grade is.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzM4MjIw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2023-04-27 14:24:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Watanabe is not a professor you want to take. He rushes through examples. Grades for little things such as scratch work even when you are just checking your work. He never gives clear answers to questions and gives quizzes on random days to act as an \"attendance\" check. He is not a professor I would recommend or take again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzM3NTg0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2022-08-17 13:41:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took the summer course of his class. Personally, I really enjoyed having him as a professor, but I know a lot of people in my class did not. He posts practice problems on D2L, you do not have to do them, but VERY helpful. We had a quiz every class, the tests were just like the quizzes. 10 quizzes, 2 exams and a final. I put in the work and got an A","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTkyMjQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Beware of pop quizzes--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2021-08-08 13:15:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved him. The class was a little tough because you're used to doing it one way but now you have to do it differently but he explains it and helps you. No homework except practicing the strategies. Every other class you will have a quiz but he literally goes over the content before the quiz. He's great please take him if you can.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDEzODUw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2008","date_posted":"2021-05-19 04:17:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"He never gave out homework, but always said to study everyday! It seems like this class would be an easy class because youre learning elementary math, but its way more than that, but he explains everything so well that it is all understandable. he answers emails quick &amp; is always accessible! You have to work for your grade for sure! :)","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODIyNjgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
