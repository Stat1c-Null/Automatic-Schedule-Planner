She expects us to be able to read her mind when it comes to the expectations she has for assignments. The in-class portion was fine, but the homework unnecessary. She also did not understand what she was teaching to us, and she told us that multiple times. 0/10 I'm not a fan LMON","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mzk0OTQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FYOS","date_posted":"2024-05-02 21:30:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Edenfield is a really nice, caring person.

She will give terrible grades for things that fully meet the given instructions because the instructions did not fully convey her intentions for the assignments. She is very unreasonable and assigns SO much busy work.
