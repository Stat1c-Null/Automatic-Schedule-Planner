She waits two months to grade assignments, and most grades consist of quizzes from reading the chapter. Students teach the class for her, so she can relax I guess. NEVER responds to emails. She is a very nice lady, and she dresses well. Unfortunately, I learned nothing useful.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTI0MTkx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3316","date_posted":"2016-01-12 19:25:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Johnson was the BEST math professor I have ever had. It wasn't an \"Easy A\" but that is because of the content, not her. She never moves on until EVERYONE understands what she is talking about.  She is so respectful and patient. If you get a chance, TAKE HER!!  Everyone in the class loved her, super sweet lady!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTI5MjYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3316","date_posted":"2015-12-13 20:34:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Johnson is an AMAZING math teacher! She is incredibly helpful and patient. Had homework once, 3 quizzes, 2 tests (take home) and a final. I am so sad my schedule didn't work out so I could take her for 3317 in the Spring. If you have a hard time in math, TAKE HER! She makes everything crystal clear and is respectful to you as well.
