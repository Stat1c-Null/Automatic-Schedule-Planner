Projects are graded hard. If you follow the steps & include what she asks of you, you'll have no problems. Homework is nonexistant (i never did it) and there are 5 quizzes, lowest 1 dropped. She likes to make you 'figure it out on your own' but will help if you just don't get it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjIzNTQz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH2595","date_posted":"2012-12-10 11:49:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is kinda difficult to gage but she is very fair in her grading and reasonable.

The only problem was some people seemed to have a very small base to build on.  It was a terrible class, I still have no idea what she wanted and I made an A go figure.
