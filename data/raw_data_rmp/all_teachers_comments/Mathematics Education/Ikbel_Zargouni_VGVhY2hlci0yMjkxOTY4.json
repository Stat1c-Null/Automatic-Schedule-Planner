I would take her again but the courseload was awful. there were SO many topics so she had to teach really fast. I failed every exam except the final. I honestly don't blame her because she did the best she could plus math is my worst subject.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzMxNzg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2021-12-11 17:59:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"She goes over the topics very fast, but she is usually clear on most things. ALEKS is the main source of everything besides our tests which are in person. She also gives you like ten attempts for each quiz to make sure you pass. The class itself isn't that hard, just pay attention and complete the homework.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDcyODk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2020-12-30 23:38:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a great teacher to have to teach College Algebra, and I'm taking her again for Pre-Cal. She will help you with any problem you have. She grades fast, and she is very kind to her students with her being a math teacher and all.
