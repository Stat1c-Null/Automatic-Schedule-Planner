She genuinely cares about each and every one of her students. Always there for you to answer any questions or help you out in any way.

I had her for an 8 am and I actually didn't mind getting up in the morning for her. She's a great teacher who makes the class enjoyable. Compared to other KSU 1101 teachers, she gives out ZERO work. She assigns reading but you don't have to read.

It can be hard and the tests are harder than you think.
