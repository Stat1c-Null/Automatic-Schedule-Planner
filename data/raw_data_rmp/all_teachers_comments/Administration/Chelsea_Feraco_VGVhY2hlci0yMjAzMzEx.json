The projects are easy and so are the tests and quizzes. The final was super easy. This class is an easy A. The professor is also very nice and understanding. You are only allowed to miss a certain number of days, but she is understanding. Doesn't go by syllabus.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDk2MTk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
