He breaks down in-class homework step-by-step, perfectly preparing you for exams. The exams are fair, 2 written short-answer questions and the rest multiple-choice, plus they're open notes! His personality made class enjoyable, one of my favs in the MPA program.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTAzNjU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAD6200","date_posted":"2025-05-06 18:06:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very knowledgeable on subject and does a good job at remaining neutral. Attendance is mandatory and a part of final grade. Easy to follow lectures and easy assignments. Show up for class, take good notes for exams, and you'll do fine :) ","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTc5NzIz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAD6700","date_posted":"2022-12-11 04:33:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took POLS1101 with Herbel online and the experience was very disappointing. The class was both very work heavy while being extremely uninformative. The only resources being a power point every week with very little content. The biggest frustration of this class was that Herbel would NOT RESPOND TO A SINGLE EMAIL no matter the channel or reason.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDcxMzEx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--So many papers","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAD6700","date_posted":"2022-11-28 18:01:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took him for POLS 1101. If you like writing and are open to 3-page essays every week (literally), this is the class for you. The content isn't hard but he is a tough grader. For a beginning-level course, I think this was more difficult than necessary. But if you have to take him, plan your time accordingly!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTAwNjI3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAD6700","date_posted":"2020-12-17 19:57:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"You will work for your grade in his class (writing intensive), but he is open for questions and clarification. You can tell he is knowledgeable on the subject and cares about his students. Tests are timed essay and I found them to be quite difficult. Overall worth taking and I am proud of the work I did for this class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTIzNzI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
