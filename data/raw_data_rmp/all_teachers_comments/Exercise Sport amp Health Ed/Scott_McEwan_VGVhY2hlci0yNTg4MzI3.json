Scott is fine) Wants to see your improvement more than cares about grades, but ofc wants you to show up to class and be respectful. Fosters a great environment and made class fun. Really does help you improve, but he doesn't make anything super hard or demanding.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzMyNTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1430","date_posted":"2020-04-23 02:03:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"HPE classes have tough attendance demands overall, it's not him. Scott (&quot;Sir&quot; is not allowed) is the literal best. My beginning volleyball class was my favorite ever. He is so fun and hilarious, while also actually coaching us to be better. Even if you're bad, he makes you a great volleyball player by the end of the semester. 10/10 no doubt","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTA5OTY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?
