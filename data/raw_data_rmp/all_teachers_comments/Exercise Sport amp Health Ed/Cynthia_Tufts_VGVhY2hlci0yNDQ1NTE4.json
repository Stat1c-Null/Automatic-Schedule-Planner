However, the teacher was a super harsh grader and final exam was extremely difficult with little guidance and no study guide. I had to drop the class because I didn't want a pilates class to ruin my gpa despite only missing one class the entire semester.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODMzODgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1480","date_posted":"2024-12-16 23:24:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take her! This was a 1 credit class and required more time to study than all of my other classes. The final exam was also way too long for the class time that we had. She also doesn't provide any resources to study except for a white board she writes your notes on and what she talks about during class.

NOT a beginner yoga class. She doesn't post the notes anywhere she just verbally says them. They are not easy to understand if you don't come from a HEAVY science background. 3 papers you have to write based on these notes and even if you give her the info she gave us she will give you a bad grade. Grades grammar in a yoga class.

She was inconsistent with how she graded things, with very little feedback. There's 3 papers and a final. Attendance is mandatory. Her lectures were confusing and people do not know if they're going to pass or not as she said she was putting grades in the last day of grading.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzQ2Mjkw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--So many papers--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE1490","date_posted":"2024-05-02 18:17:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took beginning yoga with Professor Tufts.

The exercises you do in class are beneficial and help you feel more comfortable with pilates.
