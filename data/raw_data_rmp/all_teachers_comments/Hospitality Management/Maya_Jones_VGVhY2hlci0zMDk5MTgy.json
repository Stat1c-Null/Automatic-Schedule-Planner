There's a participation grade, but her lectures are interesting so it's easy to stay engaged and want to come to class. Another bonus, her lectures are short so you're rarely there for the full 1 hr 15 min. Highly recommend!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTg2Nzc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
