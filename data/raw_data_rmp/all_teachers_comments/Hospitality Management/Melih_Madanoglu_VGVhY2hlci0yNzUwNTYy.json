In fact, so easy that almost no one goes to class. Grade is based off of discussion posts, a few short papers, and 3 exams. He grades very easily so simply showing effort will get you a good grade. Nice and understanding guy.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjUyMDg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HMGT3100","date_posted":"2023-11-19 17:47:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the most understanding and helpful professors at KSU. He genuinely is passionate about what he teaches and wants the class to be engaged in the material in every aspect. The course is almost entirely two-exams, but he provides studying material and genuinely wants to help you. Please do yourself a favor and take his class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDE3ODYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HMGT3100","date_posted":"2023-07-14 18:01:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Madanoglu is great at communicating his expectations in class and sticks closely to the syllabus. He typically takes a week to grade, but he is an easy grader. Just follow the guideline he sets and you will pass with an A in the class. I would definitely recommend taking him over the summer.

He provides excellent real world examples in class that really helps you understand the material better. He works hard to get guest speakers to talk to us and provide us with the possible paths we could take in the field. Grades consist of many discussion posts and a few tests, super easy, hard to fail.
