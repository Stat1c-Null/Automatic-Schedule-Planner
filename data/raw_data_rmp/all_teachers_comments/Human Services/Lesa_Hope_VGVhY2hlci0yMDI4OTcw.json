She has a lot of knowledge about the field as well. There was a group project, 2 test, and a paper.  The class was something I looked forward to and I was able to learn a lot, especially while working on the group project. I'd take class again!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDUzODI4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
