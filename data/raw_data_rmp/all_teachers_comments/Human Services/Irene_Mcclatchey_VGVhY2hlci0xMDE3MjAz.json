You have many different reflections, a presentation, and like two very simple and opinionated papers.

She knows a LOT about the process of dying and grief and i respect her very much (she has a sense of humor too!). No tests AT ALL: just discussions, reflection papers, and a final paper. I have a 100. If you are human you can get an A.

She is extremely helpful and accommodating. Emotionally this class is hard, but everyone cries in it at some point, and I cried almost every single day so you won't be alone.

There is a midterm, a final, attendance, and 20 hours of volunteer work that you have to do. She gives study guides. She posts her powerpoints online.
