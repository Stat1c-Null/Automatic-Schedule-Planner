Students can always schedule a meeting time to address concerns and identify feedback for assignments. She is easily accessibly outside of class and wants her students to succeed.

Resources manual is 10-20 pages but she gives time in class and can work with a group. Can only miss two classes. She is very helpful. We watched videos, did forms as different ways of learning. I would take her again.
