She is truly passionate about her job and has lots of experience (which proves helpful in learning the subject). Her lectures can be hard to understand just because she jumps around alot (she is very hyper) but her tests are VERY EASY you are practically guaranteed an A.

Memorizing the handouts she gives you wil give you an easy A. BUT she doesn't teach you anything. Most of what I learned from the class was from other students during discussion. If you ask her ANY in depth questions she just redirects the questions back to the class.
