He's so funny and nice and will answer any question you have super fast. He is not like some professors in the department who I am scared to talk to because they talk down to you. He genuinely wants you to learn and do well in his class. I always take him when I see his name.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTE5MjI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4500","date_posted":"2020-07-20 07:23:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. King is great and I wish I could take him for more courses. I took an online Summer semester with him and his schedule and expectations were super clear. The syllabus was exactly what you needed, the schedule was easy to follow, and the assignments were well weighted. 5 quizzes (just short essays you have a few days to complete) and 3 projects","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTE5MzEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3335","date_posted":"2019-05-11 02:24:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"What an amazing professor. Ive taken him a few times. His lectures get boring but if you pay attention and read you will pass. Hes very understanding, and wants to help. Dont skip because his PowerPoints are hard to understand. They dont have a lot of information.

Read the book before class in order to understand the material and ask questions so the class is not bore. He is funny and very understanding. Many people drop his class becuse they think that his paper are to hard. Before you thing of drapping class talk to him.

He has a dry sense of humor that not many people get but I enjoyed it. He legitimately wants to help his students understand the material and learn. He is very responsive and very understanding. He's a very nice man but his class can be kind of boring due to the power point. It's overall a very easy and enjoyable class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTE2OTY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3335","date_posted":"2012-08-14 08:54:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"great instructor and great guy.

His dry sense of humor is hilarious.
