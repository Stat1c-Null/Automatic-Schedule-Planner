Attendance is mandatory but her classes are so fun that you end up loving going. If you go to class and take notes, you should ace the class without a problem. She is very knowledgeable and you can tell that she loves teaching. Absolutely take her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDY3Mzcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
