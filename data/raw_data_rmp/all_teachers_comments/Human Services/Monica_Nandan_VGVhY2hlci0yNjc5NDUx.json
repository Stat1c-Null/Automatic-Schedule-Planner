Never gave us feedback or rubrics after a major assignment, said they would drop the lowest quiz grade and never did, and had 12 in class activities but only graded 5. Hopefully they will fix the course but I doubt it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDE5NzA1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SW7702","date_posted":"2022-10-07 14:53:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"LOVEEE Nandan!! She is so passionate about what she teaches. She is able to really engage the entire classroom, and I was never bored in her class. Her classes are heavily dependent on class participation, and coming to class prepared: reading all material, watching required videos, etc. I highly recommend taking Dr. Nandan, amazing professor.
