Assignments were easy with 2 journal assignments (2 pgs. ea), 3 graded discussion posts, and a few online training certificates. We didn't go over the book nor were we tested on its content. Easy and informative. Heavy material. Wish it was offered in a live setting.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTQ1MjA3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
