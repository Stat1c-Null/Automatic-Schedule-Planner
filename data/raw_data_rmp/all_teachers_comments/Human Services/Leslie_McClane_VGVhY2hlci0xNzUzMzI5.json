Just be ready for a couple tough papers. Very picky about APA but gives feedback on what needs to be improved, it's an easy A if you're a good writer/use previous feedback on other papers. Allows 2 absences then takes 2pts off final grade for each absence after that.

Although there are no test for this class, there are papers and projects that are very time consuming, She grades extra hard, and can sometimes come off as being rude.

Loved her :) Lectures can be kinda long and boring sometimes, but very informative. Make sure to read the powerpoints and textbook before the test because if not you'll be lost on the tests. Easy points on the volunteer hours and reflection paper- just make sure you do them.

Tests are easy but they are super tricky. You are better off reading the chapters in the book then studying the powerpoints.
