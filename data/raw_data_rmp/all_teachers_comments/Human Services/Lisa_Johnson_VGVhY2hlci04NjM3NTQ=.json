She was in the field for a while, and went back to school to get her doctorate to teach. &amp; She is phenomenal. I wish I was on the case management track so I could take more classes from her. She cares about her students. I had her for a three hour, block class. She used all of the time, but I was never bored.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjI5NjMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures--Caring--Would take again","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2260","date_posted":"2017-12-09 23:30:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a nice teacher but her exams are really hard.

She is an awesome professor, and class is interesting and fairly easy. For HS2400, there is one easy paper, two tests, and some smaller grades. Her tests are from her powerpoints, so its not necessary to read the book but it does help.

It is a complete waste of time and I learned absolutely nothing. The instruction was horrible and the content was horrible. Tests were given with 10 parts to one question and only an hour to complete. This class needs to be taught face to face by someone other than Johnson.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDc0MTcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2275","date_posted":"2014-04-29 14:34:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. J is an amazing teacher!!
