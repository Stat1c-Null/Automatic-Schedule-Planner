The class is very boring. However, if you have to take it, I'd recommend taking it with Mrs. Henson. She does what she can to make sure students leave with knowledge from the class, and she attempts to liven up a boring topic as much as she can. It's an easy (but boring) A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDk5OTY2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tests?

It is almost impossible not to receive an A in her class. She does extra credit, allows you to turn in work late, and the assignments are super easy. Just do the work some point in time!
