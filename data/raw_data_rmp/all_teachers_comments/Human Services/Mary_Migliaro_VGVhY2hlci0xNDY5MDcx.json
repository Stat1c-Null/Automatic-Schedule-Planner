Only had a few assignments/tests but she doesn't really grade that strictly. Watched a lot of videos/had a lot of discussions. Sometimes her grading criteria is confusing. I would ask her to clarify, she would and somehow I would still do it wrong. She is still pretty easy though, very nice and caring.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njc2NzU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2016-12-13 15:07:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"You basically watch a bunch of videos. Don't waste your money buying the seminar book. The only test you have is the midterm, and you don't even need the book to ace that. Make sure you get your volunteer hours early on, because she won't really help you if something comes up, other than that it's hard not to get an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDY5NDgz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2016-12-01 14:58:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Miggy is okay, but the class is so pointless. She makes you volunteer for 10 hours and write a paper on your experience, but I didn't volunteer and got a 98 on the paper soo.

Reasonable but not a pushover. Tests are pretty easy if you come to class+ do the study guide. There is one big group project- make sure you have a good group.

VERY clear grading rubric, and gives plenty of bonus points. Incredibly easy to talk to, and gives great feedback on all assignment.
