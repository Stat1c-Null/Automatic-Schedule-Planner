Process recording, mock group interview, an actual video/audio recorded video of someone in the HS field, and a final. Read the texts and review the power points! Attend class! That one point could cost you an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzQzMDQ5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4410","date_posted":"2012-05-10 15:25:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the best professor EVER!!!
