Her class can be challenging at times and she doesn't lay outh the test answers for you, you have to think for yourself. But she is a really greg professor and really teaches you a lot.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTEwNDc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2260","date_posted":"2012-07-15 19:43:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was patient, clear, very supportive, & intuitively addressed individuals and class needs. Class wasn't too hard or too easy. Read, participate, do the study guides, & practice for recorded interviews. You'll encounter issues in real helping situations-drug use, abuse, etc.  So worth it. I'm changing my major to HS because of her class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDkzNjkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3350","date_posted":"2012-04-06 10:20:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great teacher. Her exams may be a little hard but you will get an A if you study all of your notes. She's the kind of teacher that will make you think about what's going on in the world.You have to do a journal every class which is not that hard. I would recommend everyone to take her class, even if your not a human service major.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDA3Mzg3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3350","date_posted":"2011-11-22 15:16:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is tough on her grading. She will count your tardies as absences. She gives pop quizzes. Her class was very hard! She even graded harshly on presentations. It was a good class just impossible to get an A.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5Mjk5MDA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3350","date_posted":"2011-10-27 00:05:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"The material is thought & emotion provoking. Professor Sweat does a good job explaining the material, & I like her choice of text books. She is on top of ATTENDANCE (&tardies) for sure. Her opinion of you is reflected in your grade! She is a good professor OVERALL.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTE0MzMz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
