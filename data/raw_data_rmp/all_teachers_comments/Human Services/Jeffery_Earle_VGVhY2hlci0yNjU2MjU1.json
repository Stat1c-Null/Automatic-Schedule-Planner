His lectures are very interesting, often including stories from his personal experiences that make the class engaging. Provides great answers to questions. Weekly quizzes, exams every four, and a final. The PSA assignment is weighted the heaviest, so it's important to do well on that.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjcxMzYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IHS3240","date_posted":"2024-03-26 18:13:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor, strict on attendance. The textbook is provided by him for free, every week there is short quiz based on reading assignments, lecture, and textbook. Lecture are okay, I like that he doesn't read off the slide he knows what he's talking about. Sometimes he'll start discussions in class on random stuff which is cool.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDg5MzM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IHS3240","date_posted":"2023-12-07 16:12:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a very chill professor and isn't too harsh of a grader. Quizzes were easy as long as you paid attention, and the essays we did have had a clear rubric. People said he was kind of harsh but I just think they didn't read the directions tbh.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTU1NTU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SW8706","date_posted":"2022-05-12 19:00:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took him for Fundamentals of Behavioral Healthcare.
