She cares about all her students and wants to get to know every person. The class is very group-heavy as there is a semester-long project on a nonprofit of your choice but she is always willing to help and guide. Her tests are very heavy but they are open book/notes and no webcam.

It is a semester-long project that is very difficult and confusing, but she will try her best to help you. She is not a harsh grader, but her expectations are high. Tests are also difficult, but she will help you get a good score. Overall, I would take her again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTYyNzkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4200","date_posted":"2021-11-24 05:56:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Rodriguez is hard but fair. She is willing to offer extensions on assignments if you communicate with her. She may make you cry but only because she pushes you to your true potential of greatness. She goes above and beyond for her students. Her test are hard but passable.

This is suppose to be an intro class into nonprofits and it was more like a graduate level, advanced class. You have to create your own nonprofit which was outrageously difficult, then it is ripped to shreds by brutal &quot;sharks&quot; she recruits as if you've worked in the industry for 10+ years.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDQ5NDY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HS2200","date_posted":"2020-12-29 04:36:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"You will definitely be hands down in this class. A big chunk of your grade is based on a semester-long project that you have to work on with a group so be prepared to know the materials and work with other people as team members.
