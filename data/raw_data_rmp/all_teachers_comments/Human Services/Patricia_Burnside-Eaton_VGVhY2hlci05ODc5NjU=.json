At first I was hesitant about taking her class because of the work load that was posted but it was totally worth it.  I wish I could take her for more of my classes.

She might give a pop quiz and there are a few small assignments.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDA4MDEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2250","date_posted":"2012-04-26 21:13:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"I LOVE Professor Eaton!
