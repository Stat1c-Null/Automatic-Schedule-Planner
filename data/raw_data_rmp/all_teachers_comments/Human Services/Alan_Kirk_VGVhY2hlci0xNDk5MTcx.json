It's based heavily on metaphor - more like a sermon than a lecture. The tests are thorough and require more than simple recall, but he is a fair grader and often will curve the scores so you can't fail. He makes a lot of inappropriate comments about women.\n\n","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODYyNzAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SW7706","date_posted":"2018-10-10 14:25:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Interesting, engrossing lectures. His examples are well-thought through and illustrate the topics better than anything I can find online. Papers assigned are not overly difficult, and are mostly short assignments. Midterm was challenging, but grading is very generous. He is willing to talk to students anytime. Lots to learn, but a great class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTU3OTQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SW8705","date_posted":"2014-05-08 14:12:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Kirk brings unparallelled experience and insight into the classroom.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTk4NjQy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MSWRSMSW","date_posted":"2011-05-02 13:20:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTA2ODU4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MSWRSCH","date_posted":"2010-11-20 17:02:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"He has his own way of teaching.  He won't let you take notes the way you like.  Then his tests are totally on the notes he wouldn't let you take.  He doesn't have a text book to look at.  He can't remember what he tells you from one minute to the next.  His stories are interesting but his tests are impossible.  Not a great teacher.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Nzk3NzY2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
