She regularly brings in guest speakers and her class is extremely informative. She is very caring and understanding. After every guest speaker, you write a 1 page reflection paper and there's only a few projects. Take her!!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTM5Njky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
