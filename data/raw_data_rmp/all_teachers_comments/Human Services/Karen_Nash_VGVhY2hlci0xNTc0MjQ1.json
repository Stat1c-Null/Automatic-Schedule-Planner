Everyday we did practice role plays. there are 2 pop quizzes that are 5 points each on a scale of a 100, so they can determine if you get an A in her class. Her test are okay ,the final was kind of rough. There were a few papers and one project. You will earn your grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDYwNjkx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4425","date_posted":"2015-07-27 08:19:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome class and teacher is very informative and helpful.

She told very interesting stories that you can relate to the material. Not a hard class at all. Passed with an A and never cracked open the book. Just show up to class, pay attention and participate. You will do fine. 2 Papers, 2 Test (A combo of MC, Short answer. TF).","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDU5ODgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2400","date_posted":"2015-07-15 16:58:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"I absolutely loved Mrs. Nash. I usually never write reviews but I had to for her. She cares A LOT and is very inspiring when it comes to helping children. There was one assignment that we all felt was  unclear, yet overall she was great. I had her for Cultural Competence as well during the same semester. Wish I could take her for all my classes!!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDQyODAz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2275","date_posted":"2012-08-14 08:50:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"she really cares and wants you to learn and succeed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTcyNjk1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3320","date_posted":"2011-11-22 15:27:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful teacher!
