She is so inspiring and you can tell that she loves teaching. Has so much experience in the field that it makes it a pleasure learning from her. She will have you do role-playing activities but don't worry, these even helped the most shy people develop more confidence as public speakers. Very knowledgeable.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDY3Mzg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2260","date_posted":"2014-07-15 12:46:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Such a caring, passionate professor. Our class was like a family just because of the environment that Professor Green created. Just pay attention and do your assignments; almost a guaranteed A. Definitely one of my most favorite professors; she made a boring class well worth attending.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDQ2Njkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
