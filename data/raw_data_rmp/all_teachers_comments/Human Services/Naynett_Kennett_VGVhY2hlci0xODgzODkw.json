She would teach one thing, and then I guess forget what's in her own powerpoints and count it off.

She cancelled class 5 times and it was a one time a week class. It was a laidback class till November when she realized how much we had missed. Very sweet person but very unorganized class.

You have to apply yourself to pass, but it is not a difficult class.  I would not mind taking her again. She does take role everyday, and you will sometimes need to use your book... especially because she expects you to read to discuss things in class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzM0MjA4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3300","date_posted":"2014-11-24 14:06:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful and sweet professor!

Yes at the beginning we used 2 texts and eventually stuck to one. Read the required chapters and review the ppt before class. Questions are from readings.

I hate going to the class because all she does is read from the power points verbatim. Tests consist of multiple chapters from two different books with no study guide or any kind of review. She doesn't respond to emails and only talks to her favorites on the front row.
