She's knowledgeable and presents materials in a way that makes it easy to understand. She ensures students learns and not just memorize course content.

Took her interviewing skills class and really enjoyed it. It was a super relaxed atmosphere and I got a lot out of it. She made the content interesting and gave many, many real world examples.

She's not for the meek at heart. She has a lot of field experiences that she brings into the classroom. She needs to be a fulltime professor as she has so much to offer KSU.

She challenges the class and expects us to read, as a professor should. She has a lot of experience and gives examples if things are unclear. It is necessary to keep up with the reading, and if you do not she can tell. She likes for her students to be engaged.
