Guided learnings have a ton to it for something thats not worth a lot in your grade but its only participation based, not graded on correctness. My only complaints are that the check-ins are really repetitive and you do a lot of copy and paste from previous ones. Quizzes are 40 questions and timed and sometimes can be tricky","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDk1NDI2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WELL1000","date_posted":"2018-07-29 23:39:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Such an easy online class. The only mildly difficult part is the Healthy Living Check in, but they're just time consuming, not hard. It's an easy class, and the professor knows that. Nothing to sweat about and if you do have a few bad grades, there's an extra credit run. She does not allow late work, so turn things in on time.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzg0NjYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WORKI3542","date_posted":"2012-03-12 16:43:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Williams was sharp and very knowledgeable in her subject area, and she has high standards, so if you are lucky enough to have her, you better come prepared. She has very little tolerance for apathy and excuses, but she's understanding when and where it really counts. She sets high standards and expects her students to rise to them.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTAzMDIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3335","date_posted":"2008-07-10 17:08:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had her for working with families all material on the test is in the book and she does power points. read the book and look over the power point you will pass true/false and multi choice test which is easy and fair.
