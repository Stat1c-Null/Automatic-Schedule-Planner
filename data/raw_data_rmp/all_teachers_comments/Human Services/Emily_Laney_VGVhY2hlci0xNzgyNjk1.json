She is nice and I enjoyed this course. Make sure you read what she assigns and pay attention to world events like the news because the class will consist of discussing about how world events relate to community organizing. Besides that her assignments are clear and you will have to do a paper in her class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzU1Nzk3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3300","date_posted":"2015-11-10 20:41:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Laney's class is extremely long, and by long I mean boring. Her lectures are painful to sit through. The later the class, the more painful it is. She tries really hard to spice up her classes but it doesn't work. She's not really funny like other professors so I guess that's why. Oh, you better read for class because she does pop quizzes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mzg1NTI3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3300","date_posted":"2015-11-03 16:38:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a pretty average teacher.

I loved her class. The discussions were super interesting. If you are uncomfortable with discussing controversial issues, then this class probably is not for you. Read the articles and participate in class discussion and you'll do fine. There're no test but a few easy papers.

She was so much fun to take, and I learned so much from knowledge and that of those speakers she had come into the class.
