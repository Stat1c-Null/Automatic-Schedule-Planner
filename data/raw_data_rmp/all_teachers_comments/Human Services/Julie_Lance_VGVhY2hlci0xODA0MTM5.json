I only used the book once during the midterm. She's not \"easy\" but if you put your all into the class, then you will get a good grade. She instilled my confidence in being a HS major. Can't wait to take her again... Take her!!!

This class included a book review paper, 2 quizzes, a final and a presentation on a topic of our choice. She is helpful and clear when lecturing. Come to class and you will do well on her quizzes, also attendence is a part of your grade. I would take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzcwMDAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4450","date_posted":"2014-12-15 14:21:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"A sweet teacher.
