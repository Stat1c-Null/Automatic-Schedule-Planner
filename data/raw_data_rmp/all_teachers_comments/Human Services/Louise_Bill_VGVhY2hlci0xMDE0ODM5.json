There is a lot of work involved in writing grants. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU DONT WANT TO WORK! dr, bill is extremely helpful and knows this subject well enough to teach in her sleep.

She's one of the few people on staff that seems to actually know a whole bunch about what she's teaching and isn't just reciting the book. The tests aren't hard if you listen in class.
