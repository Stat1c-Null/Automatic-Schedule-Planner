I would say more than half of the course was spent in our groups working on assignments/presentations. One grade is given for the whole group, so if your members do not do the work then youll have to do it for a good grade. One final project at the end (group presentation) so no final exam.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjIzNjM3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"HS3304","date_posted":"2016-12-13 23:12:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very clear about what she expects.

I still winded up getting lower grades than I was expecting. When I had difficulty in the class I asked for help and she was helpful with helping me to understand. She is a great teacher, but she grades harsh. Plan on getting your feelings hurt grade wise.

She is extremely knowledgeable and presents the material well. READ YOUR BOOK because she will call you out in a heartbeat and attendance is mandatory. Grades come from mid/final and volunteer hours, and the projects that go along with it, which she is very lax on. She loves disagreements - but be ready to back yourself up!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTY0NDk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3304","date_posted":"2012-01-07 17:41:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Collard is a very nice person however, her class is very boring and hard to pay attention to.
