The tests are difficult, but mostly due to the amount of info in the book. You MUST READ your book! Actually, you need to study the book, reading it is insufficient. I feel that this class should be required for all HS majors. She teaches you a lot!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTA5MjU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"H4420","date_posted":"2012-06-27 18:05:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Made 100's on essay quizzes and studied for 5 hours for test and failed. Professor had power points that were not posted and had little to nothing to do with the exam. The class was instructed to read the text to prepare for the test and were test on obscurities within the material rather than the core.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDQ5MjQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4420","date_posted":"2012-06-26 12:55:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very Boring! Uniterested in assisting students with exam preparation.
