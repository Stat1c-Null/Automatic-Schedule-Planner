Gets all students involved and makes class so that everyone WANTS to show up! He is hilarious! This has been, by far, my favorite class! There aren't a lot of grades but you do lots of activities. He isn't a harsh grader. He cares about his students and their success. There are no tests but there's a big presentation.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTA2Mjc3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
