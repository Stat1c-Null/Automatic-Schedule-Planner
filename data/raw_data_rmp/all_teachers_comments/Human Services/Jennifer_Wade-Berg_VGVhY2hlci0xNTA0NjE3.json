She is tough and excepts for her students to do their best on all assignments. She does move the due dates, but in our class they were moved per the classes request. Learned alot & worked hard, is the reason that we r n school!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTY1OTkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4490","date_posted":"2011-05-03 01:12:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"ughhhhhhh This woman can dish it out but can't take it. She is super hard on students but can not do her job worth crap. She never communicates. She is late to site visits. She takes forever for corrections on assignments so much she has to push back dates. She has a huge attitude. I would say run... if you want your sanity.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTEyNjY5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4490","date_posted":"2011-03-18 11:35:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hard, but fair","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Mjg2NzY4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS4490","date_posted":"2010-12-03 23:20:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"YIKES!
