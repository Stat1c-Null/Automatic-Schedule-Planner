She does a great job explaining the content and encourages her students to be their best. She's really funny and makes every class interesting. Attendance is a must and it helps if you come to class prepared and read. I just hope she still gets to teach at this school.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDA3Mzk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS3300","date_posted":"2012-01-07 17:43:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"I absolutely loved Professor Wilson.
