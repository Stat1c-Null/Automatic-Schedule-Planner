She had absolutely no leniency with her attendance policy and lectures were straight from the book. She has no respect for her students yet she expects so much in return. TERRIBLE class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTM3MDI0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HS2233","date_posted":"2009-04-10 00:29:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Teacher is young and I think this is her first time teaching, so it may be a learning process for her also. Class work comes straight from the book(powerpoints). The guest speakers are very insightful. You have to do volunteer work and a paper that is do before the final. Very little homework, and some participation in class dicussions are easy..","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NjMyOTk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
