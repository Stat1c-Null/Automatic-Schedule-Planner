I hate it, Parks is terrible. I will spend several hours reading for a quiz and make a bad grade because the wording of her questions lack clarity. I would never take her again. Just awful.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTQyMTc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANCE1107","date_posted":"2013-04-15 10:19:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Parks makes this class way harder than it should be. She is very strict, and if you don't take good notes then you will not do well on her tests. She does not make herself very clear. The only part I have enjoyed are the guest speakers.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTM2MzU4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANCE1107","date_posted":"2013-04-04 01:09:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very strict when it comes to attendance. You can only miss 3 classes. Do not be tardy because that is half of an absence. You have sign in sheets. TAKE DETAILED NOTES or you will do bad on the tests. Read the articles for the quizzes and highlight main points. I thought it was going to be a breeze but its not. Kinda annoying...","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDg0NTcz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC2000","date_posted":"2012-11-30 12:13:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her for Dance History.  I really enjoyed it.  Make sure you take thorough notes and read the chapters required in the book.  The quizzes are easy and straight from the book.  The tests are not hard but make sure spelling is exact.  If you love dance then you will love this class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTIwNTI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC4490","date_posted":"2012-05-07 19:55:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"I enjoyed taking Chinese Dance with her.

However, attendance is practically mandatory. This adds to the high school atmosphere of the class She is strict and very rude to her students in a somewhat condescending manner There is no book, but you have to pay for performances","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzkxNDE5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANCE1107","date_posted":"2011-07-21 18:12:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great teacher. her test can be quite challenging but whatever you need help with she will help.
