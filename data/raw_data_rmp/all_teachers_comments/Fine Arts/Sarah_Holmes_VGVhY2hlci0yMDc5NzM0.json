I disliked how tough of a grader she was and how many reading assignments she gave. She did provide quality information that I will forever hold onto. I feel I have expanded the way I think, and I have become more open minded due to her style of teaching.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMDUyOTQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--So many papers--Get ready to read","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC4100","date_posted":"2017-04-14 23:14:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I think Dr. Holmes is very knowledgeable but she is so bad at COMMUNICATION. I DO NOT think that my grades should suffer because she is unable to communicate effectively.  I asked her during class if for my research paper I could conduct a simple test on a sample of students and she said I could but now says I have to certified.

Assignments usually due Sunday & usually the same things -- discussion & quiz (which you really don't even have to do the readings for.) 2 required outside performances (30$). Super generous in offering extra credit, good feedback, justifying grades & quick to email back. Super nice lady.

There is one group project at the beginning, plus lots of quizzes and discussions. She isn't the easiest to communicate with, especially for an online class, because she rarely responds to her emails. Overall it isn't a bad class, but it definitely isn't an easy A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjE1Mzkx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--EXTRA CREDIT--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"DANC1107","date_posted":"2016-02-17 01:02:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Holmes is without a doubt a knowledgeable professor in her field. The simplicity of her powerpoints makes it easy to take notes from. We had one test- the final, and quizzes nearly every week (I failed most). You have to go to 2 performances and write a paper on 1. She offers extra credit, and I got close to 9 points added to my final grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDYyMDA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
