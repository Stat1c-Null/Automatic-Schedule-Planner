I certainly don't always agree with him, but I learn so much and he is usually always right. I value his opinion and would recommend him.  He is helpful, but you must ask questions for him to respond more to your work. Once you ask, he is GREAT!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTc5NzUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TWOD1105","date_posted":"2007-10-20 17:35:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took him for 2D design.  He is the biggest jerk. Nothing is good enough for him and everything sucks.. He claims he's a real artist but he's nothing but a wannabe. Critiques &quot;best to worst&quot; (how awful is that&#63;) He's ridiculous. I don't know what these other people are saying. He's leaving for SCAD thank god.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTQzNDUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DRAWINGI","date_posted":"2005-11-13 17:43:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was a great teacher.
