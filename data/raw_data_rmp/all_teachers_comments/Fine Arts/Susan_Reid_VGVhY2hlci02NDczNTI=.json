I loved performing scenesmonologues because she gave great feedback on how to improve performance. Downside is that you really can't miss more than 2 classes or it drops your grade and it felt like we had 2 written assignments a week on plays (which you have to go pay to see $5-$8) couple extra credit @ end of semester","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDkyNzAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2007-11-19 20:18:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was interesting! I enjoyed it! There was a lot of outside performances that were required, but all were entertaining to me. The final for this class is to perform a play. In a group of classmates, you have to write the play, design costumes, lighting, sound, props, and much more. Her tests are easy if you pay attention.It was fun!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNjgwNDUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2007-04-02 15:24:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is so annoying which in turn makes the class annoying. I love theater and going to plays but she made it so boring and unbearable. I really hated this class. It is an easy A though... I would try to take Baldwin if she teaches it.

If you talk to her one on one she is really nice and caring. The class is a little boring - I was hoping for more interaction but it is a big class.

She tells you EXACTLY what she wants, then the rest is up to you. Be very mushy and detailed in your reports....  Offers 30 extra credit points, which is very easy to obtain. Usher if you can!!!!

I don't know if this is how it is for all theatre 1107s, her classes were mostly lecture. Every day: &quot;what did YOU think about this&#63;&quot; Not much interaction with other students, besides the group project. Be VERY afraid of making her mad. Apparently she can be very rude.
