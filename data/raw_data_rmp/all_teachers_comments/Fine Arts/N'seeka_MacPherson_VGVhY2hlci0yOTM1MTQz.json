Teaching this class is not her priority obviously. It took over 3 months to receive grades on discussion posts, and very little feedback (if any). The entire course was based on her personal opinion about culture. No extra credit offered, all quizzes take specific questions from the videos embedded in the online \"blog\" lectures.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDQ2MzA2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
