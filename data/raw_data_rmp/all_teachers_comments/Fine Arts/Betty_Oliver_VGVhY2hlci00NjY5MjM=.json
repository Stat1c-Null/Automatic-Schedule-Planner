She assigns readings & an assignment, but there is no exchange of knowledge, no hints, just &quot;here's your book, do it the work!&quot; Assignment directions are not clear & there's NO grading criteria or feedback! I did not expect such poor quality at grad level.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTgzOTQ2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM4030","date_posted":"2007-11-20 00:20:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very detailed and will grade you on EVERYTHING so dont miss a step! also, her class is boring because her style is boring, but other than that it can be a fun class, but after the 1st hour YOU WILL BE BORED and ready to go home!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNjgxODAz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART3000","date_posted":"2004-10-02 13:04:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"She knows this stuff inside and out. She is very patient and grades very fairly. The tests are difficult if you didn't take good notes and reviewed them. All notes are online -- tests taken directly from material.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MTI5Nzc=","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
