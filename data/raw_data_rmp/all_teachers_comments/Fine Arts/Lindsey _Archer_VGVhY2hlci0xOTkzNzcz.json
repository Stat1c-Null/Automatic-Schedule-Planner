I mean she is no where near the greatest and she kind of doesn't really keep anyone interested in class but I mean it was a pretty easy A. If you do the really long homework readings and keep your notes by you when you take the tests you should be fine but she really isn't that good of a teacher.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MjkxMTA2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC1107","date_posted":"2015-04-28 15:40:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst teacher at KSU. Take this class with a professor that actually values their students. Don't expect to get an A or B in her class. It's not even worth the time or stress.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Njg4MDQ4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANCE1107","date_posted":"2015-04-21 14:49:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you are reading this, move on to the next professor. There is nothing positive to say about this her. She values her dance team more than her teaching aspects. 2 mandatory dances and a 5-9 page paper you have to write. This week alone, I have a paper, quiz, exam, and lesson to do just for her class. It's a shame KSU hired her.

You have to take notes because she only shows her powerpoints in class. Her tests are based on those powerpoints and on some of the readings. She also has a strict attendance policy. Don't miss more than 3 classes or she will drop a letter grade. Classes are boring! AVOID TAKING THIS PROFESSOR.

Tests are tough and so are quizzes. Everything is online basically except her notes. Quizzes are only 5 questions but require you to read a 13 page article just to pass them. She reads from her notes the ENTIRE time. I wish I would've taken theater instead. Class lingers on slowly. Don't take her, huge disappointment.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NjA4MjA5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC1107","date_posted":"2015-04-16 11:31:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's probably one of the worst professors I've taken here at KSU. All she does is read off the PowerPoint which makes class so boring. She gives weekly quizzes that test if you read long articles(9-13 pgs)she posts. Tests are a little hard but gives extra credit. Requires you to go to 2 plays. I wouldn't recommend her & would never take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NjA4MTAz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC1107","date_posted":"2015-03-25 00:59:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly, save your money and time. DO NOT TAKE HER. I am currently taking her online and it was the worst decision I have yet made while in college. She takes forever to grade things that have to manually be graded, and when she does grade things, she takes off for anything. Her tests and quizzes are hard, and most of them are trick questions.
