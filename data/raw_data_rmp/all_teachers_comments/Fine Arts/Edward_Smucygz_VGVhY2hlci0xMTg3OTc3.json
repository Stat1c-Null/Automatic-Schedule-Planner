I love art and was a bit bored going to class.  Wish he showed more excitment toward the subject.  But, he is a new teacher....acts more like a student than a professor.

If you want more of a challenge, don't.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mjk0Njg1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2150","date_posted":"2009-04-29 14:24:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher! very easy going.

He is patient with his students and gives good advice on how to better your skills. Don't question his teaching style, you'll enjoy it. But it doesn't help that he is attractive.
