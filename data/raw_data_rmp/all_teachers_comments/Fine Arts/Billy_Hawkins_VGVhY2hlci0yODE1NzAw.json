The dance material is interesting and engaging, but he is a bit closed-minded and particular about things. He asks you to give effort instead of \"looking right,\" which is subjective and hard to gauge.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDk4MzM3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC3310","date_posted":"2022-08-28 17:06:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would not take his classes if you don't have to. For his dance classes, he will throw the entire warm up at you and then just expect you to remember the whole thing. When you ask him to repeat things he gets frustrated and makes you feel dumb. You will also never get an emailed response from him. He cares more about his dance career than yours","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NjE1NDEx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
