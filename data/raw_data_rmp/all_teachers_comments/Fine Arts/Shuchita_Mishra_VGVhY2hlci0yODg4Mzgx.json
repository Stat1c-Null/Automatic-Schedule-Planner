I think she can be extremely harsh with her criticism so much that it isn't helpful, but rather discouraging. I've already seen and heard students withdrawing her classes and even changing their majors because of how rude she is, which is sad. Very hard to sit through her class without feeling tense.

I was struggling with an assignment, trying to use Photoshop. She let me use her iPad and sat with me, teaching me how to use Procreate. She is the reason I started digital art. I feel way more confident after taking her course.  Super caring, open, and passionate. Very easy to talk too.A+ will take again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjY1MTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART3705","date_posted":"2025-05-09 00:03:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had Professor Mishra for Sequential Art I. She was a fairly good professor, attendance is extremely mandatory so do not skip. She may seem a little harsh at first but she warms up later on.
