He always works with students if missing supplies, and if there are misunderstandings about the assignment. He is a genuinely great guy who is very passionate about print, and it is easy to get along with. Made me passionate about printmaking. 100/10 would take his course again!

He gave us the freedom to explore topics we were interested in and gave fair and helpful advice. I went into this class scared of printing but left wanting to do more because of how much fun I had.

The projects we did were really fun and mainly focused in screen printing. This class has a fun and calm environment. I would recommend Greg Stone to anyone trying to take any printmaking class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTc5OTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Art4256","date_posted":"2023-07-17 01:23:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took prof Stone for advanced figure and it was fun. Students got to experiment with mediums he brought in and he was always ready to give feedback on a piece. He also set up an art exhibition for us which was cool. Summer can be a bit heavy though, 4 outside assignments on top of class 4 days a week. Doesn't grade too harshly but does grade fair.
