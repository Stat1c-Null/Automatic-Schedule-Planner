You have to attend two dance concerts and construct an essay on them. The final was the same as the study guide. Easy A if you do your work.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTQxMzI5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Dance","date_posted":"2022-12-13 05:28:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor but just gives an insane amount of work. As a STEM major, I think I had more readings in this class to complete than any of my other classes. He responds to emails really quick and has clear grading rubrics but has a lot of work. He grades generously but this isn't a class you can take and slack off.
