He is open to giving advice and feedback to anyone who is willing to ask. He comes across as callous at first, but that is because he tries to maintain the highest level of professionalism. He will not baby you; to him you are an adult. Amazing dance class...","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NzY3ODAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANCEHISTORY","date_posted":"2006-04-03 14:57:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"this is a history class. KNOW THAT FIRST. this class is all lecture and extremely boring. if you don't like to attend history classes, he is not the prof for you. he has an attendency policy and his exams are one all essay and one all multiple choice, over all, easy class.
