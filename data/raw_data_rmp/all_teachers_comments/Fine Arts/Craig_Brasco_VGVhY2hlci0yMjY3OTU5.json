Four projects and he works alongside us for the first 2 so we can see how things are done from the beginning to the end. The last two projects are cool, you have a lot of freedom. Attendance is mandatory unless you have access to adobe aftereffects at home. Great class and awesome professor.

He gives great feedback, and is super clear on grading criteria. Always ready to help and give feedback. He helped me with projects outside of class as well. \nHis critiques are not harsh, but he won't be afraid to let you know if something doesn't work. Very helpful.

I took him online over the summer, so it was very fast paced, but he kept us on track and we learned a ton about digital art tools. Gives really good feedback and advice on your art, and pushes you to the best final product possible. Very understanding if you have issues, and entertaining lectures.
