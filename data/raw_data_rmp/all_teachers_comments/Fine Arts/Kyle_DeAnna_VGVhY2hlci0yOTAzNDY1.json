He is super personable and cares about all of his students. He is accessible outside class and gives great feedback as well.

His class is fun to be in and he's super supportive. He has clear grading guidelines, clear goals, and works with you through every project to make sure you're on the right track. I learned a lot about design and the programs in his class. If you're in the graphic communications concentration he is a must take.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzQyMzIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3021","date_posted":"2023-12-01 20:03:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"I definitely recommend taking a class with Kyle at least once! His classes are very laid-back and you will create art you can actually use in your portfolio. He uses class time for critiques, so most of your work will be done at home. He doesn't take attendance but he will notice if you're not there and it will affect your project grade.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDg3NzQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PrePress","date_posted":"2023-10-11 03:03:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the second time I've taken Kyle! He makes the class fun and doesn't limit your creativity regarding projects. Do expect a lot of work-in-progress critiques since that's how he mainly uses class time. He gives great feedback and will push due dates if needed. You do need to come to class since participation is part of your project grade.
