Definitely a class I looked forward to. Easy A for completing the assignments. Works w/ you on dates to turn in any missed assignments. Weekly quizzes on the ppt or readings. Way better option than music or theater appreciation!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTI3Njk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC4010","date_posted":"2020-05-03 05:40:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed taking Dr. Clarks class. She is a bit weird and quirky but honestly, it makes boring classes more fun. It can be hard to keep up with her sometimes and she tends to ramble.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTg3NzU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC4200","date_posted":"2019-12-26 20:27:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Analysis and Criticism of Dance with Prof. Clark, and you would assume the class would be challenging and writing heavy. Unfortunately, she did not teach at a collegiate level. We were taught like children and played elementary games in class. She did not challenge me once nor did I learn much about the class's curriculum. Waste of my time.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzYwOTI4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
