He lectures so make sure you take notes if you are interested but that really has nothing to do with his papers, so if your not a note-taker, then that's okay. Papers are easy and fun.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTU1NTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HON2290","date_posted":"2011-10-26 11:07:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Wilson is kind of like an old rebel. He DEFINITELY knows what he's talking about and is so passionate about his subject! The class, itself, can be really boring (I took the rare book room class), but he really tries to make it entertaining. Be sure to speak up in class, it counts for a large part of your grade. Take him.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTEwMTI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
