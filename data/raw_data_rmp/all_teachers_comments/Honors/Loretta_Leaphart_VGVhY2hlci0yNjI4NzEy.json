This class was a hybrid class but was online for most of the time. There are quite a few reading prompts and readings to do, however, they are pretty easy to complete. A few papers, reading prompts, event attendance, and a few discussion posts make up the majority of this class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTk1NDA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
