Do not slack on the assigned readings and take lecture notes. The textbook is used throughout the entire semester. There are weekly 350 word discussion post, which can be exhausting. Two 5-7 page essays, go to the writing center!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjUxNDc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2120H02","date_posted":"2022-05-13 22:29:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is challenging if you aren't great with literature. Dr. Miles gives lots of reading for homework, but a lot of it's interesting. You're expected to discuss it in the next class. The weekly discussion posts are long and irritating at times. But she's understanding and grants extensions. If you put in the effort, it'll show in your grade.

She truly cares about the students and recognizes that we're all human, so she's willing to work with you.

Two mid-length essays and weekly discussion posts, but mostly she really wants you to participate in the class discussion. Only difficult thing was her essay topics are really vague but she expects a specific thesis, but you can run it by her beforehand","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTU0NDg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2120H02","date_posted":"2020-12-09 04:28:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great English professor. I took her for one of my honors courses and she is very understanding and tries her best to work with all students. There are few grades, which include a midterm, final, two papers, and weekly discussion posts.

It almost put me to sleep every single day. What she expects from her students on a weekly basis is quite ridiculous. There are so many readings on top of discussion posts and literary analysis. Good luck if you take it.

She's kind, knowledgeable about her subject, and easy to talk to. She can be scatterbrained sometimes but it just adds to her charm. She's so open & encouraging of alternate readings of the texts, though there is a load of reading, but it's manageable. I adore her & wish I could take her again!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjU0Mjcx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
