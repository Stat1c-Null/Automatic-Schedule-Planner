The class has lots of busy work but is easy. My only qualm would be that she seems to be a bit na&iuml;ve about diverse viewpoints (being LGBT, being a POC, etc) which I feel is crucial in a class like this.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDEwOTEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
