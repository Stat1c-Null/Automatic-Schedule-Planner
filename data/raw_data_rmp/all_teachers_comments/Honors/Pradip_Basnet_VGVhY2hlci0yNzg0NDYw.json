His report criteria was very clear and easy to follow. Everything you need is gone over in the slides. It's also in the lab booklets. I suggest putting a bit of effort in the reports to make it nice, but he suggests not spending too much time on the making of the report.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3OTAzNTM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2212Hon","date_posted":"2023-01-12 03:37:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed having Dr. Basnet. I took him for both 2211 and 2212 and thoroughly enjoyed both classes. They are challenging but I feel Dr. Basnet does a great job ensuring the classes are engaging and interactive. He is super accessible outside of class and will go WAY out of his way to help you if you need it. I cannot recommend him enough.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzIzMjUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211L","date_posted":"2023-01-05 17:45:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"he's genuinely passionate about the topic he teaches and wants students to learn.

There're lots of new and complex information but very interesting to learn about. That said, Dr. Basnet challenged me and helped me at the same time; he is probably one of the best teachers/professors I've ever had. You can tell he cares about the students performance in and outside of class.
