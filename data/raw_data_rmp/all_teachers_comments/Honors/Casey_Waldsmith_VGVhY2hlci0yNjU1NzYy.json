I was able to make it up via a MS teams meeting and did not lose points. Ms. Waldsmith was very nice and helpful, and she seemed to have a great personality, even though I only saw her for about 2 hours. The class was very easy, only 2 big assignments, both easy.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTA4NDE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
