Everything was pretty clear as he uploaded videos on how he wanted the assignments submitted but his grading policy is a bit confusing. He WILL take off so many points if work was not given like his videos. Good professor but picky with grading. There is only 10 questions for 3 exams. Does not drop lowest grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTQ4NjQy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SURV2200","date_posted":"2023-09-12 13:34:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very knowledgeable in the subject and organizes contents on D2L well.

Also his power points usual have no number for example problem, so you never know what is given. You need the text book because he makes the test open book &amp; open note which you would make you want to take the class, but don't.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDA0MzA0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
