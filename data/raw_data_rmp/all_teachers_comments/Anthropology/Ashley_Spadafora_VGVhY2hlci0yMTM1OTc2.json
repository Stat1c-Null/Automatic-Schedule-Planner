She is very passionate about her job and an easy A if you show up to class and read.  If you do not like reading and writing responses then do not take her class.

Assigned heavy reading every week, but it was very hard to read. She taught it as  more of a major class than an intro class. Very hard to keep up and gave quizzes over the reading. She talks extremely fast and barely explains.

Final is a paper/project but you have lots of time throughout semester to do it. She assigns lots of LONG readings with some discussion forums that count as quizzes.

I would say this class should be taken by people who are truly passionate about anthropology (even as an introductory class).

She is a very VERY biased professor who preaches on having no bias. She does not teach this class as an intro class.

Very understanding that it was only an introductory level course and cared deeply for subject.

She does post them though. She tends to get off track and voice her beliefs and opinions a lot. She does post all your readings online so you don't need to buy a text book.
