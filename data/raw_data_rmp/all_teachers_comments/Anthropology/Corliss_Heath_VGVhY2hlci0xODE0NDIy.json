The instructor was concerned about our learning process and asked what she could do to better engage students and help us do well on tests. The second half of the semester was better than the first half. As her first class, I think the professor did a good job.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjgxNjQy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH2201","date_posted":"2013-05-01 13:56:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Asks student's for their opinion, then laughs at them if she doesn't agree with them. PowerPoints, tests contain too much material (five chapters.) Case in point: She curved the first test SEVENTEEN points. That's how hard it was. The next test? Fourteen. Enough said. Maybe it's because it was her first class, but hopefully she'll improve.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjQ3MDQ2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
