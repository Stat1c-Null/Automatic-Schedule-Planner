I also felt like he taught me a lot about how to try and understand other culture's beliefs and practices. Tests are mostly based on vocab, but they aren't too hard. The final project he has you do is cool, I wish I had spent more time on it, but he still gave me a 100 for it.

His attendance is mandatory and there are quizzes on his attendances sometimes but someone in the class can send it to you if you're not there. There is a lot of group work and also there is a big project kind of work at the end of the semester that you work with a group on and another about a son.

There is a group work, and you have to read articles before class, which at times you could be quizzed on at random. Attendance is mandatory.

However, I would not take his class again. It felt at times that his political and social views would seep into his lectures.

With lectures I normally struggle to pay attention, but I enjoyed his. There was a reading or video every class, but they were not hard and were discussed in class anyway.

They are so patient and understanding and I could tell they genuinely respected their students. The class was very very reading heavy but as long as you get the basic gist you'll be fine. We didnt have any tests, instead just a few papers and weekly discussion posts.
