I liked the class, No tests or quizzes! Final was optional!!

She said they would be posted the Thursday the week before and the assignments were not uploaded until Tuesday the week that they are due. She wouldn't upload until Tues and would have stuff do that day. She did hand out 100's which was nice but it was way too much work to not be posted on time.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzA2NzQ3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
