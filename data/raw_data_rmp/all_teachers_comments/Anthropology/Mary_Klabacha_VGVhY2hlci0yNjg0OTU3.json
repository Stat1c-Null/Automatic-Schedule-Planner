She's wonderful and if you have the opportunity to take a class on Archaeology, take Klabacha!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzExMjcz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH3305","date_posted":"2021-04-12 11:58:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was not organized very clearly. We usually had to read a chapter a week and had an assignment every week, and 5 discussions overall. She wasnt a harsh grader though, but her instructions were very often not clear. Not a bad class though, there was barely any real due dates. Not a bad choice.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTM1NjA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
