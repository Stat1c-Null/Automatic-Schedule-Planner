Her class was very easy for me and because she gives you a chance for extra credit I ended the class with over a 100 average. The rest of the class had a little trouble though so take this with a grain of salt. Overall, if you are willing to pay attention in class and do the work, you will be fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzc3OTg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
