He's not a very interactive professor, there was hardly any discussion in class and so it was very hard to pay attention and learn. He presents the material very dryly. Tests questions are both very vague & very specific so it's hard to study for.

He was very understanding and caring about the students, and was really reasonable. I wish more professors are  like him. I had him for human sexuality, the anthropology version, and i enjoyed the class and the discussion we had.

It takes a bit of time to get used to his humour and teaching style (he can come across as slightly awkward), but he's much more comfortable once you get acquainted with him. He's very smart, super nice, and I quite enjoyed him as a professor. He's also the tallest person I've ever met.

Extremely boring and dull lectures. The lectures consisted of him reading directly from a PowerPoint for the entirety of the class. This class had the potential to be interesting and even controversial, but he managed to make it the most boring class I have ever taken. He's a nice person but a very dull professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzODA1ODAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
