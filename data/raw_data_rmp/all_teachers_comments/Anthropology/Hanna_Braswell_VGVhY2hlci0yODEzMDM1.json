Quizzes are easy, almost every test question was literally taken from the quizzes, you'd have nothing to worry about if you take this class. It just wasn't very interesting.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Mzg3NjA0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2023-01-09 15:18:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved prof Braswell. They were super chill and understanding if I needed to turn something late. They arent so far removed from college themself so it was really nice to have a professor who genuinely understood that college is a lot. \nBe respectful, make an effort, and pay attention to lectures and you will be fine.
