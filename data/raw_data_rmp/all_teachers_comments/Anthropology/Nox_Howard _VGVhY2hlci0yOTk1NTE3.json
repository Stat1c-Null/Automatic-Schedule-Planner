Depends on you if you take notes bc it's all from the textbook. Tests were 100 question but open book no lockdown. Final project was easy, you can also work ahead. I finished class with 3 weeks left.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTk3NjI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH-1105","date_posted":"2024-12-07 04:27:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Biggest nothing burger of a class ever. Three tests, one final project, and one quiz a week. Really straight forward. Test questions were pulled almost entirely from the textbook but I found a lot of them to be pretty hyperspecific. Easy class overall with VERY little commitment needed.
