He expects you to read the book, understand the material, and put that out on a test. There's very little organization, and so you must be prepared to organize yourself. The work load is a little ridiculous for a 2 hour class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNjgzMTc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH2105","date_posted":"2011-12-06 03:03:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"In opposition to the rest of the posts here my experience with him as an online teacher was a pleasant one. He was far from unreasonable, generally gets back to you in a timely manner of you have a question, and willing to help- something I rarely see in college professors. He expects a lot of work for a 2 credit hour class, and one negative thing I will say is that he swore up and down that he was going to curve heavily on the exams but it ended up being only 10 points or so.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzkyODI4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH2105","date_posted":"2011-04-13 00:04:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Oh WOW if you see this please I beg u do NOT take his online anth course.

Online course, no participation from the prof. Annoying glitches: tests posted incorrectly, obsolete material.

If you are self-motivated and can get things done, then take this professor. He gives little direction, but he doesn't grade harshly and is easy. I made an A  and hardly ever opened my book.

I took it during summer semester online and got an A. His tests are based mostly on the book so if you read it carefully once or twice and make good notes you will score high.

He adds extra point to the tests if class does not do too well. As long as you read your book and highlight important part you will be ok.
