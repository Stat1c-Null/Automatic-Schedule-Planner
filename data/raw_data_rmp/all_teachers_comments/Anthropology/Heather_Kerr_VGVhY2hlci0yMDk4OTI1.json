Loved this class. there was so much material, but she did a great job of presenting it all. Would love to take this class again. She gives a quiz every week, or every other week, and offers extra credit on each one. Also offers easy extra credit questions on the test. Take her!!!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDY5OTg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
