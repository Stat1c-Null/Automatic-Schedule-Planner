His tests are multiple choice and one short essay that he gives you beforehand. You MUST do the assigned readings. They consist of 50% of his test questions. Read, show up, do the 2 projects (also easy) and you will pass with flying colors. His class feels like 6th grade though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDcwNjc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH4410","date_posted":"2011-05-04 02:56:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lundy is awesome. You can really tell he loves his field and loves teaching it. However, sometimes i felt he got a little TOO excited and went a kinda fast, but its better than being boring i guess. 2 tests, 1 group project, and 1 ethnography paper. Read the articles assigned for the test! Attendance is big part of grade!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTIxOTgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH3300","date_posted":"2010-12-03 00:48:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful professor.

Thank goodness because some professors sometimes forget when they teach an introduction class that it's just that an introduction class!

Pretty clearly explained his expectations & assignments for the course. The topics we discussed were interesting & he did pop quizzes randomly. Readings assigned were important for multiple choice exams. He did reviews before tests w/ actual test questions. Very fair grader.

He is nice, but can sometimes come off as being rude or making comments that are unprofessional.
