She does not explain things well at all and is not clear on tests or scoring. She gets annoyed if you ask her anything and makes you come to her office rather than emailing back. I made a B even though I made A's on everything except attendance-which is random days inclass work- which 2 of mine she lost","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDE0NzI1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH3310","date_posted":"2014-09-02 17:36:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really cool professor...clear explanations of class material..She uses examples that I feel I can relate to; that make the topics pretty interesting!!!

Aside from this, her classes are fine. She uses PPTs and values class participation at 20%, so show up and do her assigned group work. She's a fair grader and shows movies in her classes, so while it's nothing fantastic, it's still worth taking her class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTkzNTQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
