She was hilarious, kept you interested on the topics, and extremely personable and approachable. The material may appear intimidating at first but between the way Fazlollah teaches and the labs it is easy to remember.

Our class had awesome discussions everyday. She is also the type of teacher that will call you out though, and she absolutely despises it when students are late.
