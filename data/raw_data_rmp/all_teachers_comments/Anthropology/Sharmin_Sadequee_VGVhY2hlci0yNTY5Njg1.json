If you just read the material (even just skim), watch the lectures/DOCU.s she puts up &amp; occasionally read the textbook when she emphasizes it, you'll easily get an A. Class just requires common sense &amp; her accent wasn't hard to understand.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTA2MTkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH1102","date_posted":"2020-09-15 22:04:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"There was a lot of reading but they were (mostly) interesting.

She has an accent which can be hard to understand. Tough grader when it comes to essays and discussions. Quizzes only had 5 questions so if you miss one then you blow your grade.

Powerpoints that she teaches from are never on the test, so there is no point in going to class. Tests are worth a MASSIVE portion of the grade and there are only 2 of them, so if you mess up one you have to do insanely good on the quizzes and the next test to fix it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjEwNzI4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ANTH1102","date_posted":"2020-05-03 20:34:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was her first online class, so I won't be too harsh. However, the first course that I got C in four semesters. Lots of articles to read, and documentaries to watch. Quizes every week based on the articles.

Still easy. haven't opened the book and have gotten at least a B if not an A on all quizzes and tests (hybrid, so they were online). Just pay some attention. Her lectures are terrible, pastes 3 paragraphs on 1 slide, then reads at nascar speed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTk1MDYw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ANTH1102","date_posted":"2020-01-27 17:23:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Sadequee is a good teacher. I think a lot of people have an issue with her heavy accent, but as a person thats not great at understanding accents, trust me when I say its really not that bad. Shes thorough in her lectures, but she doesnt post the powerpoints online, so coming to class is necessary. Her tests are pretty easy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODcwNjk2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
