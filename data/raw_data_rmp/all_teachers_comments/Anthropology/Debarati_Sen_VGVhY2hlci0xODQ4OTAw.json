She would forget to upload the material for the week until Thursday, when everything was due the following Sunday, and would not give extra time. Ended up dropping because it was too difficult to follow what was due when, and I didn't want to fail.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjc5Nzg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ANTH1102","date_posted":"2020-07-22 15:24:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"TAKE HER!!

Dated, long, tedious documentaries that we're forced to watch. Almost never responded to student emails asking for help/clarification. Class was relatively easy to get by on your own.

Another 30% was the midterm which was a media analysis discourse paper. And 40% came from the final exam which is a mini-ethnography of a ritual paper. Have to read to get good grade in discussions and other stuff which is graded harshly by TA in course. Got an A though.
