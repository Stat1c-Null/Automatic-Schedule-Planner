She is enthusiastic and our theme was the zombie apocalypse. How cool is that? Quizzes were done online with the book. The material was covered the next day in class. Speech grading was straight forward and she went over all the guidelines before you even start. She is a newer professor at SPSU, but I would highly recommend her. <3","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzcxODg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BCOMM2200","date_posted":"2013-05-03 11:01:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good teacher","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjY2MzMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1101","date_posted":"2013-02-05 16:18:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very enthusiastic and easily heard. very involved class. reading quizes the first nine weeks. pretty easy overall","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMzIyMjc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2400","date_posted":"2012-12-17 12:45:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher! She will get you involved with public speaking and her class was always fun to go to!! Her speech rubrics are not that bad so you can make many mistakes and still pass each assignment. You only need the book at the very beginning because you will read and take quizzes. The book teaches you everything you need to know!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDk4NDE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
