Dr. Dickenson is extremely knowledgeable and lectures well. A bit heavy on the writing assignments, but absolutely manageable. He is difficult to get ahold of outside of class and is frequently late to lectures, however these are recorded. Just catch them after the fact.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzExOTM2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--So many papers--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"QA6611","date_posted":"2020-03-02 19:37:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I don't think he know what he is doing. Would not answering phone call, email, text message. He could never give you answer right away and always told you to wait , so he could get back to you but he wouldn't; this made me wonder if he knows the subject he teaches at all. Probably the laziest person I have ever met.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTQ1MDU0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
