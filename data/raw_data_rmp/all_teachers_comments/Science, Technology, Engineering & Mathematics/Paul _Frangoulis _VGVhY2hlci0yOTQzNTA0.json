However, the professor was very understanding. Your lowest exam score was dropped. He also does give access to student tutors if you need it and is really adamant about getting help. Hardest part about the class was trying to learn through McGraw Hill.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzM4MTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DATA-1501","date_posted":"2024-04-18 20:19:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"It was tedious as it was all through Excel & I had never even opened Excel. But if u show up u will get an A! Hes caring! He wants u to excel in class & life. He made it as interesting as possible by joking and listening to students input in class. 10/10 professor & the most Ive learned in a class(ps I have no datascience interest so im not biased)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjA1MDc3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
