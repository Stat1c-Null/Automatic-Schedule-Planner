Lets you makeup stuff within reasonable time, very knowledgeable and overall a great guy. Lectures are boring but you learn a good bit once you get into the swing of things. He does change due dates without posting on d2l, so if you miss class you might miss that","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mjk1MjEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG2160","date_posted":"2020-04-29 14:36:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the first professor at KSU I have loved. He is so chill with everything, and helps you out whenever you need help. My class was from 6:30-9:30, but he always let us out around 8 or before. Just get all your work done and don't be behind, and I guarantee you will get an A. He's great!! :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTU1NTU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG2160","date_posted":"2020-03-16 00:14:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"SInce no one rated, I'll be the first. Compared to the other teachers, Prof. Turner is VERY laid back. He is very straightforward with the HW and Inclass-Assignments. Though the class is 3hrs long, we usually leave early. He reviews for exams and quiz, and his tests are pretty simple, still study terms! Only downside is its a night class ;-;","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTc0Mjg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?
