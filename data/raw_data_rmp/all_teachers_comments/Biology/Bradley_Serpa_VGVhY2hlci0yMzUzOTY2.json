He instructed the course as it should be taught, skipping the irrelevant junk and teaching us the bottom line. Follow exactly what the lab rubrics say to do and you will get an A in this class. Midterm, final exams are easy as long as you study the procedures and calculations.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njk2NjA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?
