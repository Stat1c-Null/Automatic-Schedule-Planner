Up front with what you will be tested on, and pretty funny too. One complaint, I was always intimidated when asking questions b/c he seemed like he wished he was somewhere else/thought I was stupid. Study DAILY for this class, no matter what prof you have. Lab is much harder than lecture.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDU1MTQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2221L","date_posted":"2014-07-16 15:14:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy is the best.

I am taking him for A&P 2 lecture next semester. Very helpful when you have questions. He is a bit sarcastic which I find funny. Lets you know what you must know for the practical. He gives assignments in masteringA&P to help you earn more points so the practical isn't your total points.
