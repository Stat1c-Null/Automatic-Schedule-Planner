Points r taken off if u split the papers in the packet, often its 2-3 people sitting doing nothing & 2-3 people do work, then switching.\nU have to write ur VERY specific contributions down or u get told off.

He is an extremely tough grader. He will almost cut your grade in half if you forget to add small details. I feel like this lab was unnecessarily harder than it should've been. He doesn't accept late work at all, even if it's just 5 minutes late.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODI3NTE4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1108","date_posted":"2024-10-17 01:25:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Would definitely take his class again. His lectures are really good, available to connect outside class hours, and very responsive to emails. His exams are tough, but manageable if you come to class and study. And in general, he is a nice person so you feel comfortable going to him about the material and asking questions in class.
