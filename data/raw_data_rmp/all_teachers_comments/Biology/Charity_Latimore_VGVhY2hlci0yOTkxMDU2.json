The way Latimore connects the material to real life made it very easy to follow in lecture. Homework was basically js completion grade and her exams were not bad (uses webcam so actually study).

She was usually late due to campus scheduling, and instructions weren't always clear. Asking questions could feel intimidating, but the videos she sent before some labs really helped.
