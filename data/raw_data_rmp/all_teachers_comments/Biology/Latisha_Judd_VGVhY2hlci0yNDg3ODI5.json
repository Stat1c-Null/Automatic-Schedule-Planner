This is a for sure A with some effort. Grade consisted of 3 exams, mastering hw, quizzes and the final. Lowest quiz grade dropped. She provides so much extra credit that helps a lot!! She doesn't take attendance but don't skip class, she gives quizzes sometimes in the middle of lecture. HW is 50% of your grade so don't miss it!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzQ2OTUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Beware of pop quizzes--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
