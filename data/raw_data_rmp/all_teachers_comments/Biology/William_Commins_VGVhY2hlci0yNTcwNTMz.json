Approachable professor and I would recommend taking him for Bio 1108. Had to write up 3 manuscripts, 3 labsters, and had a handful of assignments. Boring assignments but passed the class with an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Nzc0NDU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1108L","date_posted":"2021-02-19 20:22:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a good lab professor.

He makes the lab straightforward and easy to complete. For every lab so far I have been able to leave early because we can get straight into working. He is lenient about grading, so if you do the work, then you will do well in the class. There is no pre-lab and straightforward and simple expectations for the class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTgzMDc3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?
