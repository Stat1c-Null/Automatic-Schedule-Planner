This is a junior/senior level Chem course, so you can't expect to be spoon-fed!  Dr. Salerno is quite comical during lecture, and is more than willing to help his students! I highly recommend taking him!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDAyMzE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM3500","date_posted":"2011-12-27 13:05:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was challenging.  I studied more then ever for it but I got an A so I know it can be done. At first Dr S came off distant but if you showed that you cared or put in effort he was very helpful. I dont blame him for not catering to folks who didn't care about the class. The class was HARD but I learned alot! He's a good prof too!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NjI3NDIw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2107","date_posted":"2009-01-07 22:01:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was supposed to be biology but all he wanted to talk about for the first 3 weeks was enzymes, which was more biochem if you ask me. Rude and not helpful. I warn others not to take him, he is HORRIBLE!!!! Do not buy the book, he does not use it, he only uses the random stuff he decides he would like to talk about during class.....","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzM3MTE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO101","date_posted":"2008-09-03 11:37:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very clever, with no tolerence for slackers.

He says you don't have to go to class but don't believe. If you know the book but don't go to class you will be LOST on the exams. Loves to put diagrams on exams. Wishes Biol 2107 was biochem and teaches it that way. He is rude and will embarrass you for stupid things. Not sure if he realizes he's rude but he is. Class is painful to go.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NDk0NDM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO2107","date_posted":"2008-01-02 23:03:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was a very nice man and was helpful if you sought it, he is a bit condensending, but doesn't realize it or do it on purpose.  He invited anyone who didn't have anywhere to go for thanks giving to his house.  I really liked him as a person, but he is a hard teacher, and the tests are HARD! you really need to study the book and KNOW the diagrams","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzOTM2NDI2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2107","date_posted":"2007-12-14 16:45:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"The man is genius but shouldn't be teaching a class.  Deviates from the syllabus, made two students cry and I was fearful to go to class.  He screams and curses constantly if something goes wrong.  The only good thing is that he has never failed anyone.  If it matters to you, he does NOT gives multiple choice test including the final.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzODM1MTUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
