Missed her own test date and never graded anything. The class was then covered by 5 different teachers and was a total mess. Most students dropped or failed and she never once sent a email.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzY4NDMx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"BIO1108","date_posted":"2018-11-10 10:43:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a really sweet prof and cool to talk to. If anything ever needs clarifying don't be afraid to ask or go to her office hours. She really wants all of her students to pass, but you have to work for it. Tests are kind of hard sometimes, but if you do the hw, study the ppts, read the book or watch videos you should be fine. Going to class helps.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjk3MzQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

She doesn't take attendance, but careful attention to lecture is required if you want any chance at making a good grade (record them and listen to them after class, best way to study). Book is sort of useful but can be helpful at times to reinforce concepts.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDU4MTM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO3410","date_posted":"2018-04-29 16:55:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's amazing!!! very caring and the lectures are interesting and fun. you'll for sure need to study and work hard, but the tests are fair and she goes over all of it in class.

It's not an easy class, but it's definitely doable. WORK HARD &amp; ASK QUESTIONS. I recommend recording her lectures &amp; listening back to them. YOUTUBE videos will be your BFF. She's super caring &amp; willing to help outside of class. This class is a gateway to many upper level bio courses so take it seriously!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDg0MjQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":8,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

The tests consists of multiple choice, make true, and short answer questions. It is imperative to really study the diagrams. There are lab days where you and your classmates answer questions off a sheet for a grade. There are in class quizzes and take home quizzes. Do not start the take home quiz last minute.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzAzODc2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":11,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
