I would totally understand if it was for Bio majors. She just doesn't do enough teaching of the actual material.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMDc4NTQy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO2108","date_posted":"2007-12-26 16:08:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Course already hard its taxonomy 1/2 of it and she is hard.  guidlines useless, test vhard, labs Xlong, she is helpful if u talk to her. handouts are helpful but KNOW the details and how anything and everything is related!

Handouts were massive, labs were very long, tough grader! She makes you feel very little and expects that you should know most of what she is teaching from Bio 2017. I would not recommend her to anyone, especially if you are not a biology major or any major having to do wit","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMjgyMjQ3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO2108","date_posted":"2007-01-29 09:05:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gives way too much material!

People complain cause she teaches a LOT of information and if you don't keep up you wont do as well. She gives quizzes from time to time but they aren't hard. She really wants you to know the information, and is always available for help.
