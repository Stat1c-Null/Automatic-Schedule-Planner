Don't be afraid to ask questions! He responded to messages outside of class quickly. There are regular lecture activities, but they are graded based on completion. Attendance is also graded. There is also a semester long project.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTI3NDQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3150","date_posted":"2024-12-06 00:15:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Gittner was an outstanding professor and gives great feedback. The class moves very quickly and can seem overwhelming but if you stay on top of the lecture assignments and the mini project you will be fine. His midterm is open note but make sure you do it with time as it will be long. Attendance gives you bonus points.

He moves very fast, and beware if you have an Apple computer. Attendance is mandatory, but you can still get full points if you miss 3 or fewer classes.  However, there are no tests/quizzes throughout the semester, just the final which is open book. If you show up and pay attention, you should be fine.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODkyOTg0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3125","date_posted":"2023-04-28 01:55:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class starts easily but picks up fast. Wouldn't be a problem if we were able to rely on him for the code. Spent hours on labs finicking in chatgpt for code. Attendance is mandatory. Lecture heavy and did not have a sliding scale for some grades. You either get a 0, 50, or a 100 for projects that are a fourth of your grade. Don't.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzQ3Mzgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3125","date_posted":"2022-10-26 19:00:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is the GOAT! just truzzzzzz i never leave reviews ","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzQwMzUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3125","date_posted":"2022-03-01 13:37:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really really great teacher! He teaches the content perfectly and honestly makes the class easy. The only downside is that there are a lot of assignments which he does 1 for each lecture so it just adds up to a lot. He moves pretty fast so you do have to put in the work for the assignments since they'll take some time. I highly recommend him!!!!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1ODkyMTc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Accessible outside class--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT3125","date_posted":"2021-12-17 02:10:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Frustrating at first learning R but it'll calm down. Not always clearest instructions but when you ask questions he responds super fast. Not really familiar with apple products only windows so beware.

DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP AND QUESTIONS AND YOU WILL BE OK. He does not make you do any actual math, all the math is done in the computer software.

Would not be my first choice. He is new to KSU and changed the formattting of the class numerous times. He is a tough grader and does not have clear grading criteria of what he expects and then gets mad when we dont do it how he wanted. This class is supposed to be about interpreting stats not having to do the code urself.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzA3NzM1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--EXTRA CREDIT--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"STAT3125","date_posted":"2021-11-16 15:14:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not terrible. First time teaching at KSU &amp; there were def issues. Changed modality of class 4 times, added in class activities half way through which were completion if you get the general idea. Expects you to know how to code even though we weren't supposed to be coding. A lot of having to do on our own when the labs are due, directions confusing.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjQ3MDgx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
