Quizzes are 2 attempts and fairly simple. The study guides he posted were basically the exam itself. Attend lecture and hold yourself accountable outside of class!!

He is hard to access for office hours, he only offers one hour. He curves hard, but simply because his exams are harder and more descriptive than what he offers in his PowerPoints. He changed dates very last minute, and the final is cumulative. Good luck retaining info.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mjg4MDEz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"BIOL4431","date_posted":"2022-05-09 05:52:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Powerpoints are vague in comparison to the test which go over the smallest details. Sidetracks a lot. Based only on assessments (3 tests, 12 quizzes, and final) and only two of the quizzes are dropped. The only highlight is the grading scale (100-85 is an A etc.). Always messes up grades and D2L. Avoid and take the other professor (Hessier).","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjgzNDAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
