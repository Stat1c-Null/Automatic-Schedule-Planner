He really knows what he is talking about and if you ask him a question you'll get an answer. Really engaging lectures, they were super interesting and fun. TAKE HIS CLASS! Lab was a little more difficult, but he gave plenty of time for questions and answered them thoroughly.

You have 4 test 60 questions a piece and the final which is 100 questions. The final is open note open book with no lock down browser.

He is the most arrogant professor I've ever had to take. He gets easily frustrated when you don't immediately understand a concept and asks rhetorical questions like we're stupid. Not only does he have an attitude problem, but his class is also insanely boring and lecture-heavy.
