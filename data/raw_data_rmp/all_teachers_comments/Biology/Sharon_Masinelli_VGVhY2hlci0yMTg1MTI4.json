She is really sweet and tries to help however she can. The lab was just an ordinary lab class. Your really have to read and study on your own, and if you do it's an easy A. Extra credit quizzes each week and curves the tests.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njg4MTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
