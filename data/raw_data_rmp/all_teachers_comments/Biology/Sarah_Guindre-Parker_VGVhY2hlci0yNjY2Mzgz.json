Watch the seminar before class, ask a question before class, and ask a question in class to get 90/130 points in the class. It's all participation based. There is one assignment to write an easy reflection on your favorite seminar. The content and speakers are interesting!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjUzNjQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3370L","date_posted":"2021-04-13 15:53:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"There are 10 assignments, 7 are worth ten points and the other three are 30,50, and 40. She grades heavily on all the assignments. She does not curvey or drops any assignments. She will not provide feedback if you ask her to review an assignment prior to submission, so make sure you understand the rubric right. There is no extra credit available.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTQzMzI5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Her lectures are both in-depth and concise while also presenting the material in a comprehensible form. The lab assignments were easy to follow along as well. Overall, I would definitely take her again if the opportunity arose.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MzAxOTcx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
