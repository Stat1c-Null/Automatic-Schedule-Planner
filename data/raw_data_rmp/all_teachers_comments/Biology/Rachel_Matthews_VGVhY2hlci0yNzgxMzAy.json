Lots of assignments like quizzes and the lab worksheets but they're not difficult. The biggest grades are 2 posters, 1 that you present, and she gives good feedback. I highly recommend taking her. Also, make sure to get a good lab partner.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzE4Mjg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO1107L","date_posted":"2022-03-23 18:51:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is so nice and really cares about everyones grades.
