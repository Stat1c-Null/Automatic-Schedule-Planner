By no means strict with the coursework unless he has to follow the syllabus rules given by the lab coordinator. Personally, I found the content he taught (biol 1107 lab) to be simple and not difficult. Would highly recommend taking his class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjY2MzE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO1107","date_posted":"2021-04-29 01:23:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Paul Clark for bio lab and he was a great teacher. easy grader, helps you out, makes you feel comfortable to ask questions. after a stressful semester, I was really thankful to have a teacher like him that didn't make me seem like a burden compared to other teachers I've had. he literally does all he can to help his students out.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjUyOTUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2261L","date_posted":"2021-02-21 17:41:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great person and wants you to pass.
