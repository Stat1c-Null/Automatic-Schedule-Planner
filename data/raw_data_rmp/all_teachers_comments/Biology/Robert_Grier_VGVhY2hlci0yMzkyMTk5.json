He is knowledgeable, just not a good teacher. He overloads on info that you will never be tested over and then tests over info he never mentioned.

He curved 4 out of 5 tests we had, including the final exam. Final was supposed to be cumulative, but ended up testing over the last unit to make it easier on us.

I knew there would be some harsh reviews based on our class GroupMe, but in all honesty the student complaining are the ones who didn't put in the work.

If you're a nursing major, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Your grade will suffer. 5 tests, all of which are tested on material that you are not taught.

However- he is not a good professor. I spent $130 on unused materials. He takes almost a month to grade MC exams on scantron.
