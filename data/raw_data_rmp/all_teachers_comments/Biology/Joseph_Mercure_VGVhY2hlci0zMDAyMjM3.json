As a professor, though, be prepared to do a little bit more extra work to gain full understanding outside of class. This is also a one-credit class, so there wasn't too much content to shove down your brain. Overall, it was an easy class and an easy teacher. Would recommend.

Starts ever class with a funny meme/video threaten us that will happen to us if we don't follow lab procedures, very very very funny and relatable!  Doesn't make labs long and dragged out, we called him by his first name honestly felt like we were besties, great relationship with all his students","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MTk3MTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
