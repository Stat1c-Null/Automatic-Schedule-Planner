Sometimes questions were not clearly answered or dismissed, but as long as you put in the effort, ask him any questions you have (just to be safe), and attend class you will probably be fine. He answered my emails promptly and wanted us to do well but did not make exceptions or put up with low quality work.

I told him the circumstances and was continuously told he \"can't\" extend assignments that I missed any further. He is a harsh grader, that talks to his students like they're stupid.
