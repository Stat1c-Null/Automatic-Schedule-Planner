Doesn't grade things very hard, but also isn't as accessible as she says she is when it comes to feedback on lab reports, etc. Pretty casual in the lab and lets you out whenever you finish your lab. Your grade is 175 points total - 2 50 point assignments and and a couple smaller assignments.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njc5Mjcz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
