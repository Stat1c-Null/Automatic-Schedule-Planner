She graded fairly however the tests were difficult (study the labs). She let us leave once we completed the lab which was nice because I took the 8pm class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTYyOTI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

For the lab reports, make sure you follow the rubric closely and you should be fine. Tests are a little hard, but they're not cumulative and very doable if you study the labs and pay attention to what she explains before lab. Otherwise she's a very sweet person in general and very reasonable.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjk3MzU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Tests are a huge chunk of your grade, barely any homework assignments are given. Shes nice, helpful, and replies to emails. I dont like biology, but this class wasnt too bad. Just STUDY for exams!!!!

She always made labs enjoyable and interesting even when they didn't seem to be. She's a new graduate, very knowledgeable and helpful.
