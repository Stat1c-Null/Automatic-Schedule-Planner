We had a midterm that was really difficult that we barely had any preparation on. He was available via his office hours, which helped. He has no problem helping people out but is a harsh grader. I would pick a different professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDYzMDI2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"1107L","date_posted":"2020-12-08 16:46:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Does not reply to any emails, so don't even try. Would not recommend him to any of my friends. Nice guy, but should not be a professor. I didn't learn anything at all from this class.

Majority of the time the class doesn't get the results intended for the lab. Terrible instructions to follow. He gave a midterm for some reason. Quiz every week. Make stupid posters that he grades way too harshly. Spent 3 hours in lab only to make a 76 on the lab result. Every day it's something else with this guy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTg1MzQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"1107L","date_posted":"2019-10-16 15:52:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Meh :/","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMjkwMTEz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Amazing lectures--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
