I have been disappointed with other teachers at GTC but he is by far the best! He is knowledgeable about anatomy and physiology one and two. He makes the class fun and interactive. Dr. Nakhla shows his students that he cares how they are doing and will go above and beyond to help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzU0MzE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

He explains everything really well and gives a lot of good advice. Practicals are out of his control but he does assign extra credit which is 5 points extra on your class grade! Form a group and study the anatomy models in the library. Ask questions in class. You will be fine. :)","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTI5NTUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2221L","date_posted":"2016-03-10 10:08:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing guy, tries his best to help. The class in general is extremely hard, but not because of him. Requires a lot of studying. He is very knowledgeable and gives great tips on how to remember things. He tries his best to predict what will be on the practicals so that he can help you prepare.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTMwNzg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
