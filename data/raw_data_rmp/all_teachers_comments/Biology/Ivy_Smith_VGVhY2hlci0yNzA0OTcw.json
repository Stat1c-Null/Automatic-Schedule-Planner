She makes Anatomy so interesting! She is very organized, always ready to answer questions, and responds back to emails very quickly. She is so caring and wants you to succeed!

She is organized, a quick grader, and gives lots of extra credit. She is caring, understanding, and so relatable. She respects her students and wants them to succeed.

She answers almost any question you could possibly think of and if she doesnt know she will literally research the topic to come back to class and answer it the next day.
