He gives you notes but they have blanks for you to fill in.  There are 4 tests (including the final) and 4 vocabulary quizzes. If you have to take him, use the notes he gives with your book instead of listening to him. He is very unclear. I would not recommend taking this teacher.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MzczODUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2221","date_posted":"2007-10-24 11:08:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good job.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTU1NTgy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2222","date_posted":"2007-10-24 10:56:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"great","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTU1NTUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO2222","date_posted":"2007-05-16 17:10:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"For Spring semester 2007, he got rid of the quizzes so grade was based on 4 exams (25% each).  Final is comprehensive, but could have been a lot harder than it was.  1st 3 exams were tough.  Amount of material covered is huge.  I used the book a lot.  Delivery is monotone.  Not personable.

In addition to being unbelievably boring, His tests are absolutely horrible. For A&P 1, he is do-able, only because of his quizes which are basically the equivilent of making an A on a test.
