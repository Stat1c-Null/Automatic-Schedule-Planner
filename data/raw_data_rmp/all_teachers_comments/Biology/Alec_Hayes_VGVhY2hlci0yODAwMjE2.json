Tests were very similar to the material we saw in lectures, and he usually gave us hints on what to study beforehand. There were in class activities (basically a guaranteed 100), weekly homework, and 5 tests with a retake opportunity.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODc1ODIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Genetics","date_posted":"2023-05-08 22:09:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was amazing, honestly the most chill professor ive had and accommodating.

He really wants you to succeed and is very helpful in office hours.  The exams are hard but he makes them way easier by having a review the day before the exam and basically telling you what you will be questioned about.  Take his lab too it's really fun.

Pay attention to the blue words in his lectures. Those are the main topics. Some in-class exercise questions get recycled into the exams so pay attention!
