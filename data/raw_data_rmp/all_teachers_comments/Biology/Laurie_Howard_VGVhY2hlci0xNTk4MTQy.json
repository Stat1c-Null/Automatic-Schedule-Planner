Small lab and class quizzes but they are easy.  Will count off final grade if miss more than three classes/one lab.  Fair grader.  Little textbook use. Responds to emails. Labs are easy.   Overall, she is a good professor! Highly recommend!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjE1NzA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL005","date_posted":"2011-12-14 07:47:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome Professor she uses PowerPoint for her lesson plan and gives you extra for every test... Very reasonable and lets you turn late assignments. I loved her teaching speed and methods she used to help us understand the material","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTAwODE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
