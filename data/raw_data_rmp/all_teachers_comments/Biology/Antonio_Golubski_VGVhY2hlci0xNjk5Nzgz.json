Lecture and his \"Chapter notes\" are important, textbook is not. Lowest test grade dropped, BUILD-IN curve of overall 7 points, makes for an easy A if you study the notes/lectures well.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzA1MzAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL3370","date_posted":"2013-11-06 11:59:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Golubski is such a sweet guy! He went out of his way to help me out without me even asking him to. His tests on the other hand are tricky and evil. They definitely measure who knows their stuff and who doesn't. Go to class, study the equations and principles introduced in class, use the online notes, and read the assigned chapters in the book.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjY1NzY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL3370","date_posted":"2013-05-04 21:53:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Golubski's class was simple. He isn't very clearly sometimes, so going to his office hours is helpful. Lab is simple; easy grader. Lecture portion has five tests, one is dropped, so if your satisfied with your grade after the 1st 4 tests, you don't have to take the final. The tests weren't bad. Make sure to REALLY study for the 2nd one.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjc2MDEw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO3370","date_posted":"2012-12-12 14:48:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Golubski is one of the most helpful professors at KSU. He will work with you to understand the subject at hand. If you're interested in ecology, you should definitely take his class. His exams can be hard, but he gives you everything you need to be successful. If I wasn't a premed, I would focus on ecology for grad school thanks to his class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDM5MDQz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
