The exams are a little challenging but he does well to prepare us. Also works with you if you miss a class, but it is really important to attend every lab. Overall, great guy, he likes to tell jokes. I really enjoyed his class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjM5OTc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He has a passion for biology and wants to help students understand it as much as possible. I'll be honest, the content itself is always hard because that's STEM. Quiz one week, and Super quiz the next, but there are fun assignments that are worth more than the quizzes and super quizzes so don't lose hope","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTEwMDAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL1107","date_posted":"2020-12-18 16:58:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Consisted of 7 quizzes (lab safety + 6 pre-lab, 2 are dropped), 4 labster simulations, 3 handouts, 2 practicums, 2 exams, &amp; 2 posters (1 being the final + a presentation).

But Mr. Rhiner really is a wonderful professor. This being his first year of teaching university, he was very impressive and did a great job. He's willing to help his students grow, and he is very passionate about the course. I have nothing but respect for him. I'd absolutely take a class with him again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDE1MDE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL1107","date_posted":"2020-12-02 04:31:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"At the time of this post, this guy is new to the university. Biology will always be a hard class no matter the instructor. Some of the previous responses here are clear that they student put zero effort into the class. The tests are hard. The quizzes are brutal but, you'll learn and you'll make it out a better student.

I think you need to be motivated for all STEM classes honestly. We had a quiz/test every week but quizzes have 2 attempts. The tests were hard and I myself have failed a few, but If you get A's on the other assignments (they are easy A's), it is still possible to get a B even if you get a 60 on every test lol.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzU0NTkx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
