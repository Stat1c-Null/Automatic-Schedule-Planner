Tests are difficult as it's mostly memorization, so flashcards will be your best friend. Powerpoints are disorganized so you have to watch the lectures. He forced us to group up for the labs for the first time and it was awful. Discussions were easy, quizzes were easy. Overall the class was difficult due to exams and labs.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDIwNDk1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL3315K","date_posted":"2025-04-03 18:36:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Okay so I took this class kind of ignoring the reviews. It isn't that bad however the tests are HARDD. It's hard to get an A on his labs for some reason. There isn't much work if you like that but the work is hard. It's easy to fail his exams. You cannot find outside sources for anything. Not too bad but if you have any other choice, take that one.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODY3MDY5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL3315K","date_posted":"2025-03-28 14:53:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice professor. I am in bio 1108 lecture. He is very responsive to questions and email. I am in the 8am lecture. There's a lot of PowerPoints but if that's not your style read the text book. The only downside is there is a lot of group work it can be done outside of class but you're stuck doing all the work if your groupmates do not help.

Professor is not helpful and is a tough grader on labs. Lectures are boring and disorganized and he reads the slides in a monotone voice. Exams aren't too unreasonable but definitely take a lot of willpower to study for.

Stumbles through lectures. Spelling mistakes/mispronunciations galore. Inconsistent taxonomy. Uses very recent phylogeny so you'll find lots of conflicting info from outside sources. No study guides.

This is coming from someone who has done well in orgo and the rest of the sciences. The tests are brutal and the lectures will put you to sleep. I would avoid.

Every unit is 3 weeks long, post and quiz are due the 1st wk, lab report due 2nd wk, and exam is open on the 3rd week from 12am Fri -11:59pm Sun LOCKDOWN BROWSER. Lab aren't hard but, time consuming.
