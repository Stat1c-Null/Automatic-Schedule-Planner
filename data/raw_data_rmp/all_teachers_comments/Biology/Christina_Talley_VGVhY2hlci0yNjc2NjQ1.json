The labs were easy to complete and understand. She responds to emails very quickly and gives multiple chances for extra credit. I would take her class again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjQ1MDM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL1107L","date_posted":"2021-03-13 00:13:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Talley is great! She's incredibly personable and explains everything clearly. The structure of her class is easy to follow and an easy A. Pre-lab quizzes, two attempts each, easy 100. Two tests and two practicals, again, easy A. She explains how to make a poster pretty well, too. You can send her drafts early and she gives good feedback.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDMzNDg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
