She genuinely wants to see her students do well in her class if she thinks you are studying and wanting to make a good grade.

GOING TO CLASS helps you narrow down what she is probably going to emphasize on the test. Focuses a little too much on sarcasm/humor when she could use that time to make difficult concepts a little more clear. Read the textbook before class to consider getting an A/B.
