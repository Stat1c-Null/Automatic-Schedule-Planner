Yes, you have to study, he'll tell you that himself.  He will also do anything he can to help you. He is both helpful and very nice and any negative comments you see are most likely from slackers who though they could or should get an easy A.  I recommend taking him.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzA3MjM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO2108","date_posted":"2011-05-14 20:17:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"LOVED Dr. Unwin!! It is rare to find a biology professor that is not only approachable but also really cares about how his students do in the class. He loves what he does and he keeps the material interesting and relevant. He'll push you but you'll learn a lot. Been at KSU for over 3 years and he's easily one of my favorite profs. I'll miss him!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjAyNzAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO2108","date_posted":"2011-05-10 13:07:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Unwin is great! He really wants you to succeed. You have to study a lot but this is a upper level class so you can't get around it. He's very picky about lab reports, but only because he wants to make sure you really learn how to do it. Always available for help, and gives extra credit. Lecture style is great, one of the best professors I've had.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTY4MjEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO2108","date_posted":"2011-04-19 11:43:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Going to clear some air about unwin. Positives first: available to help, loves answering questions. Negatives: academic rigor, I typically get a's with an occasional b. In Unwin I struggled for a C. The output for your input ratio for studying to obtain a grade is never satisfying. Nice person, rough professor. If you like tough take him!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDMyOTIy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO2107","date_posted":"2011-01-15 19:36:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"The man was an amazing teacher. If you want to learn biology take him. The down side was his test are extremely hard. All multipule choice, but very detailed. You will have to study quite a bit for this class and the book is the best way to do it. READ!

He really likes to see his students excel. He will help you with anything as long as you try to help yourself(he doesn't do your work for you). His door is always open for help.

His tests are over 300pgs and he gives very detailed questions. He's big into fill-in-the-blank pop quizzes. I did not like him, but if you study and read everyday then you should do fine. I got a 91 on 2nd tests & 88 on 3rd. Still got C in the class.

His test aren't really hard if you studied. He wants you to apply the conceptual knowledge you used not just memorize (this is why he has essays).

You HAVE to study.  If you don't, you'll fail, but that's college so you really have to get used to it especially if you want to go further than undergrad.  He's easy to talk to.  He seemed to get sidetracked later in the semester and it showed, but other than that, EXCELLENT!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MzkwMDg0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2101","date_posted":"2008-01-07 16:57:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"I thought his class was hard and he was a perfectionist but actually his teaching has helped me with other BIOL courses.
