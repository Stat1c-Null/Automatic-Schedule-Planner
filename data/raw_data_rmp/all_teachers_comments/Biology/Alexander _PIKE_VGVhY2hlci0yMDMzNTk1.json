You come to class, he lectures, and you get the option to stay and study or leave. There are only 2 tests (like all labs), but he always answers questions thoroughly and answers e-mails quickly! I would totally take this professor again. Attendance is for a grade, so go to class. You won't stay the whole time.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzUxMTU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
