You have to do research with your group mates and present it. Fairly easy! He is very nice and caring... He has very helpful study guides and his tests are straightforward.

Grades spread across multiple categories so performing poorly on one or two assignments/tests won't hurt you severely. Tests rely on PowerPoints, his study guides are super helpful. He likes to talk about the textbook; I have not opened it once and I've been fine. He is very strict on deadlines, though. 25% off per day late.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NjA2MDE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
