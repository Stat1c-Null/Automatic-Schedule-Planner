He does give extra credit, but he does not know where to draw the line between giving out homework. The exams are lockdown browser with webcam in class. You will definitely fail if you don't go to his class, but his lectures are hard to understand.

His class is very hard and he is pretty new to teaching but if you study what he highlights on his power points you will pass. It is exactly what will be on the exam. There is extra credit opportunity and he curves the exams. It is a lot of studying for his class.

Overall, I do not recommend him. He is nice, but he does not know where to draw the line when it comes to giving homework. It's not just the homework, he also don't know how to teach. Class attendance is mandatory, it is a burden going to his lectures, and IF YOU MISS LECTURES, THEN YOU WILL FAIL. Think before taking him.

Each week there is 2+ assignments that have about 70+ questions each, and a quiz. Very unorganized and constantly changed due dates. Students are punished for him not making it through lectures, as we had to learn it ourselves. You will need 4-5 outside of class, weekly.\n","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjE5Njkz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO-3340","date_posted":"2024-10-27 07:34:14 +0000 UTC","comment":" This is one of the worst professors I have ever had.
