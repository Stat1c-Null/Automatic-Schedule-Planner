The other reviews aren't accurate and were made out of spite because they cheated. While there is a lot of material covered in his class, it's easy for us to understand and learn from. He isn't a harsh grader, so easy A's.

The workload wasn't bad just make sure to submit the lab worksheet within a week, and you'll be fine. Also, don't forget to take the pre and pos lab quizzes. He's a good lab instructor, especially compared to what I've heard about his lectures. I definitely recommend taking him for lab.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTU3MDE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL-1107","date_posted":"2025-05-01 16:27:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing teacher!

Long, unhelpful lectures, inconsistent expectations, and participation quizzes not graded for completion. You teach yourself most of the time.
