It is obvious that she knows her information and can answer any question you would have. She assigns homework before every test. 5 tests total. None of them are dropped, but she does offer extra credit on hw and in class. Her powerpoints are very detailed, and only tests on what is on the powerpoint.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODQ4MTU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Skip class?
