Entertaining lectures and all the work is pretty easy and quick to complete which is good if you're a huge procrastinator like I am.

Although it is his first years of teaching he is doing very well. Like most labs, attendance is mandatory, missing 3 class is an automatic F. Often times he was unorganized or didn't explain the lab to the best of his ability but I feel through the years he will improve!
