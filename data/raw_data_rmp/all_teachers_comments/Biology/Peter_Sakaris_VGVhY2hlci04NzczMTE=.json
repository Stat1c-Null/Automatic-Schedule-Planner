Had him for lecture & lab. The book was more useful for the lab reports. Tests are based heavily on the powerpoints & anything written on the board. He'll do study guides if you ask for them, and do them obviously! Study, pay attention, and you should get a B+ at least. His lectures are very clear. Also, he really loves fish.

I'm more of a cell person myself but he made multicellular organisms fun for once for me! Still won't be a plant biologist or anything but he's a nice man and I enjoyed his class.
