He is also a physician assistant prof so he does not know how to teach info on a lower level. Nice guy but i struggled for a C+! You have to teach yourself in this class! Dont take him if you want an A :(","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTgwODU4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2261","date_posted":"2011-11-15 20:53:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"This prof is so smart.  I really liked him.  He is struggling a little with lecture.  But he gives you all the needed materials to make a decent grade.  Study, study and study.  He is fair on grading and is always willing to help.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjQ3Mjk0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2261","date_posted":"2011-05-13 13:41:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is new, so he wasn't the best teacher. He bounced around a lot and made you know tons of information and asked very little on the test. His tests are VERY specific. He isn't the worst teacher and he works with you and is pretty lax with grading. Since KSU only has 2 micro teachers he isn't that bad. Just study","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTk1Mzc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2261","date_posted":"2011-05-06 17:45:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Doesn't know how to teach the material. He just reads straight from the powerpoints and doesn't explain anything. Even when asked a question, he stumbles on his own words. Do not take him for microbiology, I've never made such bad grades in my life.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTQ0NDgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
