There are a couple of things that require you to do quite a bit of work, but he gives great feedback on them. His lectures are good and he doesn't make them too long. He is very easy going and easy to talk to if you have any questions.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDc0NDI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107L","date_posted":"2023-12-06 05:58:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's very easygoing and gives great instruction throughout labs! For difficult math sections, he walked through it with us and made sure we were prepared for every practicum and the final. He talks just enough to get the info you need, but he never takes more class time than necessary. Highly recommend!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTM0Mjg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107L","date_posted":"2023-10-11 14:26:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's very nice, chill dude.

I had him for lab and it was his first year doing this and he did great. He is very caring and knows what he is talking about. Weekly quizzes based on the lab you are about to do, they are very easy. Grades very nicely, just show up to class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODMwOTEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
