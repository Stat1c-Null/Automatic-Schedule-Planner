I did learn a lot and you can tell that Dr Sutton is passionate about plants which made it a little easier. She handwrites all notes and they are not posted, so you have to go to class.

Hand writes her lecture notes, come straight from the book mostly. Tests are pretty hard--she grades really tough and a lot of people got way lower than expected. Tests are a combo of multi choice, short answer and essay. Usually provides a study guide that isn't helpful.

Three tests, 1 case study paper and a final. No quizzes. She uses the Tox Tutor site in lieu of the textbook but we barely used the book.
