Wrong A LOT in the CVA lab. Basic info in lecture but expects you to know in detail for the study guide & test. Reviewed 15+ pg of notes for each exam. If you don't explain things the way she wants it, points deducted even if you're correct. Honestly, just take Ganser.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjEyNDQ3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2222","date_posted":"2016-03-29 23:20:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super easy tests! If you do not make an A on every test, you are doing something wrong. She is very, very clear on what you need to know for the tests as well, and the study guides are all you need.

That said, this professor was good. She is funny and tries her best to make the material interesting. Her lectures are not enough to make an A, I used my book to supplement quite a bit (something I didn't have to do for A&P 1).","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Nzc0MDY0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2222","date_posted":"2015-11-23 14:48:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"A&P2 is not an easy class at all but Hesser is very clear &explains everything in a straightforward way. She is such a knowledgeable prof &does a really good job in relying the information. Everything is on her ppts & lectures, but book def helps! Every quiz & test has a some extra credit ques.
