Every week's lab worksheet I completed, I never got above a low B. Another thing is taking the prelab quizzes, good luck because none of the information is on the protocol.

Never listens to students when needed help. A family emergency can occur and you may not be able to turn in an assignment so you email her and her response would be &quot; Sorry, Please let me know ahead of time.&quot; As if we knew stuff were to happen. No considerate to students.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTM4NTIw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
