I had immunology with her. She treats a 4000 level biology course like a bio 1101 course. There are these stupid assignments, pop quizzes (I know... POP QUIZZES?!?!), stupidly long homework, annoying assignments. She is also very unorganized. Very Very easy A but trust me you do not want to take her.
