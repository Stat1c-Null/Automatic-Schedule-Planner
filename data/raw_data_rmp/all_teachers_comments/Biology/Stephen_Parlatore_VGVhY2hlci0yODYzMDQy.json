He doesn't know what he is teaching. He tries to make remarks to be funny but it's just not ok to say to your students. You basically have to teach yourself because he doesn't know anything about this subject.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Mjk2ODkw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
