Tons of material for test every two weeks, slides are just pictures from the book that she explains, tests ARE HARD and complicated. Makes tests even harder if class does well on previous test","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mjg0Mzgw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2221","date_posted":"2015-10-21 21:38:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"This prof. is sweet and tries her best to get students to understand, but I think her knowledge gets the best of her. Her tests are very wordy and she expects us to know what she is talking about when she lectures. She flies through the powerpoints and does not put them online. She gives a test every 2 weeks which i found hard finding time to study","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mjc4MTM1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2221","date_posted":"2015-10-14 09:18:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Now is a really intelligent woman, she knows what she's talking about however, she's very unclear when lecturing. She'll give a lot of context to the material and when people ask if it will be on the exam, she doesn't say yes or no. She FLIES through the powerpoint and DOES NOT put them on d2L. Tests are hard because of the way she asks questions.

If you go to her during her office hours she will help you, but sometimes the way she speaks to you makes it sound like she's speaking to a Rocket Science.
