If you do the homework and show up to class she basically covers everything on the test. Tests are from home no lockdown, she gives you multiple attempts on quizzes and tests because she wants you to learn from your mistakes. Wish she was teaching 1108 cause I would take her again.

She explains labs super well and easily so you actually understand the work you do in lab and its quick to get through. They were also fun and I looked forward to them which is weird for a class.

I have taken other lab courses and lectures prior to Dr. Mueller-Hill's and never had an experience as good as hers. Biology can be a dense topic to learn but she is caring and enthusiastic and makes the class worth going to. Lots of fun activities that you also don't get in most other courses.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTM3NzMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107L","date_posted":"2022-12-13 23:56:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a wonderful person, but she talks a lot, especially for a lab!

She is a sweet person and honestly very enthusiastic about teaching so I tip my hat too her.
