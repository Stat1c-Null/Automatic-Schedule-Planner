I was WRONG, Phillip genuinely could not teach and would read off of a script on his slides. Genuinely thought I would fail this course halfway through the semester because his test were awfully hard compared to his lack of teaching. I dont think hes a bad guy just a bad prof.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjE0NDU4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL-1108","date_posted":"2025-07-23 20:25:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Never had someone care so little about his students.

His lectures don't go over the topics well, and he just reads off PowerPoint slides. His tests are intense going over very specific concepts that he doesn't cover well.
