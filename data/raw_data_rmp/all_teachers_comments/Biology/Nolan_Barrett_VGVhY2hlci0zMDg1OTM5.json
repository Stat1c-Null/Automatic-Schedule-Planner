None of them were difficult if you do the prelab reading and pay attention in the lab. The final was very similar to those quizzes. He truly wanted to make sure everyone understood the material well. There was an easy group project at the end.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDMyODc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107L","date_posted":"2025-04-06 14:18:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very open to questions and super sweet! Overexplains a lot making it difficult to understand, so reading the pre-labs is important if you want to pass, especially with how specific the quiz questions are. He's willing to help and it wasn't super hard to pass, just frustrating during labs. Not bad but I wouldn't take again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODc5MTg3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
