The Bio lab reports will be quite strict so really read the rubric. She's really caring and reasonable in class. She will guide you to the A by stating exam material. Be sure you do well on the free response questions on test 1 because they will be a hefty part of the grade","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDMzMjAz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL1107","date_posted":"2017-04-04 00:06:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Erica is a grad student. I had her for BioL 1107 and I loved her! She is willing to help and is very approachable. She does grade the lab reports a little harshly at times, so just make sure to not write them at the last minute. But I would take her again!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTg5Njg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
