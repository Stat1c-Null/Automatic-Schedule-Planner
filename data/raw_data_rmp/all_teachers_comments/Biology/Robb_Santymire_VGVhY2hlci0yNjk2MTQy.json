It is straight from the textbook or power points and it is up to you to put time into it. Tests can be difficult but are manageable if you study what he says. He is very easy to work with and was good to everyone if you are willing to ask and speak up.

He is so so chill and gives you all the information you need to get an A. The only people complaining were those just not doing the work or not following simple directions. He does not ask too much of you, so the class was easy and fun to me. It was my least stressful class last semester and I am grateful to this professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDYzNzYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL1108L","date_posted":"2021-05-06 15:53:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a completely different person in person than he is online when grading. He is super chill in person and even a little fun. However, his grading is absolutely terrible. He takes off points for every single little thing and is very harsh at grading. There are no tests and no quizzes, only assignments/labs. No extra credit and no curve.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzIyNDAz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?
