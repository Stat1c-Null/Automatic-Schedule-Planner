He isn't inaccessible, he just replies to emails AFTER his classes, but if you get lost in his email feed, it might take awhile. The best way to ask questions is in class or go to his office hours. Overall, TAKE HIM FOR AN EASY A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTk0NDQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL1108L","date_posted":"2025-01-07 19:17:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was a good professor. i learned a lot from him and he would explain things very well. but he is a very tough grader. he gives good feedback on your assignments. also when its and assignment where you first have to turn in a first draft he gives you a lot of feed back so you can do better on your final draft.
