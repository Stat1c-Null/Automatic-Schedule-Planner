Sometimes I questioned his sanity, but that's what makes a science professor good. Attendance technically isn't required but he tracks it. Has in-class review sessions for exams and lots of extra credit opportunities. Does not allow recording or anything. Read the textbook and show up to lecture, you'll do well ","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzQyMTcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL4115","date_posted":"2023-05-22 16:38:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Haddow is the BEST you will get. The class was pretty easy for a 4k bio class but I learned so much. Gives a TON of extra credit and will tell you in class what questions will be on the exam. You are usually expected to read the textbook before lecture. His lectures consist of him telling you exactly what slides you should know.

Memorization is very important and you definitely should come to class cause that's when he tells you what you need to know.

We had quizzes every day over the previous material which also included questions over textbook readings. Lectures &amp; exams were heavy, so good memoization needed. Prepare to learn life cycles and correct spelling of species. Said next classes won't be as easy as his first.

He wants you to know the information well, so studying is super important. I dont know if the class will be the same in the future, but if you do the readings and study quizzes, youll be okay.

Because of that, he did some things a little differently for a high level Biology course. There are quizzes every class and the tests are based off of the quizzes, however they do get harder as time goes on. No tests dropped or replaced.
