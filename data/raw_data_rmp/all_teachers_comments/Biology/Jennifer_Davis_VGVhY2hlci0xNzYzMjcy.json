She will not go over absolutely everything in class (because there is so much content), but will go over whats important. She also provides you many ways to make an A. The homework is almost a free 80 points, the tests come straight from the website, and she gives points for attendance.

Breezes through power points, which she doesn't know the material one because they aren't hers. Her tests are very detailed and you have to read the chapter outlines, read the powerpoints, read the book, and everything else that's given to even have a chance on the tests. iClicker for participation points.

She basically just chats during class, giving a vague outline of the material. Her tests, however, are very detail oriented and go over little to nothing of what she teaches in class. You must read the book and do all the homework (which is due every class period).

I would recommend skipping class and reading the chapters and doing the reading guides provided before the tests. This class is not easy, you will have to work for your grade.

I thought the class was pretty easy. She didn't teach anything you can't get in the book the night before, so I skipped a good bit. She was very helpful in lab though, you can tell she prefers lab to lecture. The labs are a cake walk except maybe the last one. They're barely even weighted anyway. Tests are almost completely MC, & she gives bonus Qs. 3 tests and a final + labs + 2 current bio events papers (easy)= final grade. I'd probably take her again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTgzODQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2207","date_posted":"2013-03-30 14:11:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lets just say that I am contemplating in pursuing biology because of her. She does not make it fun or interesting. She tends to cover only one topic during lecture and it does not help for exams. She is vague about exam topics! Book is mandatory! Exam does cover a lot.

She won't answer important questions, and if she does, its a vague answer. She contradicts herself a lot.
