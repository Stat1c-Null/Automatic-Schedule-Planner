She's also caring and EXTREMELY helpful if you don't understand she'll take the time to explain. Make sure to study for the MIDTERM and FINAL! This class was a lot easier and nicer to take than lecture. I also have a better understanding of content due to this class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjM1MDAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
