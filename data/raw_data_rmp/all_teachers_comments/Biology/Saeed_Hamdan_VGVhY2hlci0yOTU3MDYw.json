My only complaint is that he would start class an hour early and give those students an in-depth lecture, and give those who arrived on time a run-down few minute lecture. Also made some rude comments sometimes, made me a lil insecure, but overall helpful and will answer questions.

Genuinely the worst professor I have ever had. Doesn't teach, sat and flipped through a powerpoint just highlighting things. Zero explanation, little to no expansion of what was on the powerpoint. He makes his own tests that have almost zero correlation to any of the study materials or quizzes. 0/10, would never take again.
