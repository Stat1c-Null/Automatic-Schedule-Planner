Pre-lab quizzes are due the night before lab and labs are due the day you do them. The labs are long and can be very confusing and it can be stressful to get them completed.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTEwNjg5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO1107L","date_posted":"2023-04-26 01:21:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very odd man. He can't explain things correctly, so figuring out how to do the lab and lab worksheets is so difficult. His feedback on the assignments is blunt and dry. Takes forever to grade. I don't know how I got an A.

In his defense, he seemed to be going through a lot and had a lot in his head. He was all over the place and didn't know what he was doing- only 15% of the time he didn't get lost in thought and could explain something. Nice guy though hope he's better now.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDk2NDgy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
