He provides links and made you teach yourself the entire class (and half of the links did not even work). Some of the assignments did not even pertain to the material he provided to read and study. Most of my assignments were completed by googling and teaching myself the material.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODc5NDQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"F","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

He is not present for discussion, and he does not reply to emails. If you are looking for a course where the expectations are unclear and you don't want any help or communication from the professor, than he is perfect! If not, stay clear of him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Mzg2NTcy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOCHEM1501","date_posted":"2014-08-25 18:25:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Too disorganised and confusing with lectures and exams.

His lectures seem easy enough but the exams aren't. They are confusing for the most part. Most of the class failed exams though we attended classes and studied. Again, he is a nice guy with great lectures but exams are not what we expect from the quizzes and exams.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjY0MDUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL2107K","date_posted":"2014-05-08 09:50:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took him for Bio I. 4 tests and 10 quizzes. No homework or classwork. Tests were pretty difficult and included material not covered in lecture. You MUST read the textbook page to page and know the everything from the powerpoints. Quizzes were online, which we only slightly easier than the tests.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTk2MDg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
