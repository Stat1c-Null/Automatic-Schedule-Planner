Literally show up to class, make an effort, and I promise you'll end with an A :) Good luck!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTA4MDgw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL3310K","date_posted":"2025-03-18 13:36:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"None of the videos made sense.

There is a lot of content for this course but he makes it manageable and interesting. Lab is dissection-heavy.

His lectures were actually quite interesting, & I actually found myself interested in what he was teaching. His labs were also fun, & easy to understand. He explains/teaches everything so well, and I love that he has video references for everything. Definitely take him!!

Dr. Green is very educated on the subject & wants the best for his students. Group research project is kind of fun.

He records lectures and is entertaining during them. Labs are not usually 3 hours but some are during the semester. He gives no extra credit and does not curve exams, that is one downside, however.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTE0NjI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Test heavy--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL3310K","date_posted":"2020-10-28 01:42:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"I enjoy Dr. Greens class. I had some personal problems so I havent been attending class but hes been very understanding and despite these problems, Ive still managed to make As and Bs on the tests. Lots of labs but they arent too difficult. Tests are hard but if you study your lecture notes youll be fine.
