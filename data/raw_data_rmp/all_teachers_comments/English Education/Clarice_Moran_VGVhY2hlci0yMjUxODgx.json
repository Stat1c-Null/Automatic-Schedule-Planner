There are a lot of projects, but they honestly don't even feel like work because they're actually fun to do. If you have a bit of creativity you will thrive in this class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTExOTI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3241","date_posted":"2017-04-27 11:01:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"3241 is interesting because it's all about technology (specifically internet stuff) & that's just kind of fun, &  Dr. Moran is an angel. She's super sweet, well-organized, & just a really, really nice person. She genuinely cares about her students & that's not always common at college. She's an awesome professor and KSU is truly lucky to have her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTQxMzc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
