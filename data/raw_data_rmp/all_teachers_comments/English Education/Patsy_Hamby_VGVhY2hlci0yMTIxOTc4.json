Her lectures are fun and she will definitely teach you many things you will use in your future classroom. You will mostly do group projects in here but they are easy and fun. You also have to right reflections for every assignment , but length is 250 max. Definitely Recommend!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzcwNzI4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3390","date_posted":"2020-01-30 23:05:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hamby is so awesome! You have four books to come up with lessons for with a group. And then at the end you have one book to come up with several lessons for. She's the sweetest lady. The class is at 5 pm, which is difficult to make. But don't miss too many classes or she will drop you a letter grade. That's why I got a B","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODgwOTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3390","date_posted":"2018-10-09 11:40:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hamby was awesome! She gave clear instructions and then, from that point on, we were in charge of the class. She was very flexible and understanding of personal lives as well.

You end up teaching the class, but Dr. Hamby explains that's what she does on the first day of class. The class relies on your participation and creativity, so it's not fun unless you participate. The assignments are really simple, and it's mainly group work.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTkxMDU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3390","date_posted":"2016-11-17 16:38:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is absolutely amazing. I loved her so much I took 2 classes from her (ENGL 3390&2271)and wish I could take more. Her syllabus makes it seem like she will be very difficult but she is very easy.

She is so wonderful and you will learn so many teaching strategies and get tons of lesson plan ideas. Most of the class is group work, but you need to get used to it if you want to be a teacher.
