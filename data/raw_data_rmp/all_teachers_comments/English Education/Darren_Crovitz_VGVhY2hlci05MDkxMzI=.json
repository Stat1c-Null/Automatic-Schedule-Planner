He will work with the class on anything, and all of his assignments make sense/ have a clear purpose. So many professors make their courses needlessly difficult by packing them full of needless fluff or by having needlessly vague criteria. Crovitz does neither of these things.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjAzOTk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3270","date_posted":"2021-10-14 15:54:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Crovitz is very passionate about his work, and cares very much about his students. He is willing to work around deadlines, and gives excellent feedback. He is more focused on what a student learns rather than the grades given, and gives lots of opportunity to rework assignments until a concept is understood.
