You never know if she will answer your emails in 30 seconds or 30 years and most of her responses don't address the emailer's questions. The instructions on D2L are vague and sloppy. Classroom discussions are distracted by her expecting students to echo her own opinions.

She gave little to no feedback on assignments. Never graded on time. And never responded to emails. Don't take her. She was also incredibly passive aggressive with any sort of class discussion that didn't talk about the subjects she wanted. 100% Do not recommend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Njc4NTc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
