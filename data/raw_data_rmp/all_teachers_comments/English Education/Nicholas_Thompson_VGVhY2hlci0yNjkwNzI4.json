At first the project were really hard to understand, but in the end really helped me learn. Wish he was staying, but great professor nonetheless. If he was staying would take him again. He's very entertaining.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzcwODgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
