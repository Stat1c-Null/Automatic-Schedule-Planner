He cracks me up the entire class.  His comments & sayings are hilarious.

He is extremely helpful, fair, and understanding. He actually made the writing process enjoyable. Attendance is recommended, but he's really not a stickler. He got to know each student on an individual level. I could go on, but I'll just say take Dr. Kirby if you get the chance!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjczNjQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3310","date_posted":"2010-09-14 13:21:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I absolutely love this professor. I can honestly say that he is the best professor I've had in college. I've learned more in his class about my abilities as a writer than ever before. His classes are a joy to attend. The work is useful. His lectures are knowledgeable and passionate, but he's also hilarious. I would take any class that he teaches.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTkyMDU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
