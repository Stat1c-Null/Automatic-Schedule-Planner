My biggest complaint is the lack of feedback. It was the last week before I had an idea of my grade in the class! We had a professor approval need for assignment and she did it AFTER the due date and just left a lot to do in little time. I wouldn't sign up for her again if I had a choice.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNDA3Nzc3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDRD3360","date_posted":"2018-04-17 22:35:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"She has been one of my favorite professors so far.
