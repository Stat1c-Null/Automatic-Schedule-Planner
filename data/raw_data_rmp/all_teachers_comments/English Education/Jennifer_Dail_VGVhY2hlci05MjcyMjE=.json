She cares about her students and provides multiple opportunities each week to connect (in an online asynchronous class). Requires some group work and challenges you to get outside your comfort zone. Lots of reading, but it is interesting content!

She was frequently not on time with getting the modules up, giving feedback to students, and the course layout was a mess. There was also multiple overlapping group projects. This course turned into a hybrid at the last minute and was sometimes all online, all on campus, and sometimes one day a week.

She pushes us to learn both theory and practical application. However, the number of major projects, along with the time each one takes, is overwhelming. I wouldn't mind, but I got the impression she gave up and never graded them, so that's annoying.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTY5MjE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENED8741","date_posted":"2017-12-11 10:30:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Unprofessional and insecure. Very disorganized, though she seems to know her content and probably could be a good teacher if she were more organized. Her poor organization makes her self-conscious and overly reactive to students if she is questioned.
