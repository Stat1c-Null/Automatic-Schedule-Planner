She responds to emails quick and is always willing to answer any questions and offer support. As long as you put in the effort, you will be fine (she isn't a harsh grader). There is a major research project for ENGL1102, but even the rubric was decided among the entire class. She truly cares for students, take her class!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTU2MDQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2024-12-05 01:31:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Bramblett is a very engaging and personable teacher.

Her class was always nice to attend. It isn't hectic, I actually found it to be a break from stress from my other classes, she has 3 major grades which are essays, but she walks you through the prior weeks so it is not bad. You do need the textbook, but it is free and the readings are straightforward.
