That being said, I feel I shouldn't have even recieved a D for the class. She is nice but can get confusing, she tests on some random things that no that she doesn't stress very much in class, and almost never tests on what she does stress. Too many notes with too little time to take.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDAyNzkw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES4200","date_posted":"2015-06-25 12:37:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"-Essay MC and short answer exams.  -She's terrible at trying to explain herself.  -Has the rudest personality when it comes to students asking questions.  -Has a condescending demeanor.  -Makes your hand hurt from all of the note taking you do.  -Not much book usage, but if you skip & you have the book use it! thats where her info is from.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0OTk1MjIw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4500","date_posted":"2015-05-14 09:06:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tests are structured in multiple choice, fill in the blank, and the dreaded essay questions.

You HAVE to go to class. She doesn't give out her pwpts, so take good notes. DO THE STUDY GUIDE. If you took good notes and can fill out all the info on the study guide you will make an A.
