He is always ready to answer questions and help in any way! He does give our study guides which is sort of rare in upper level classes AND they are helpful! I would say the same for his exercise physiology class!

He's a really chill and funny guy. He really knows his stuff and is passionate. He gives a study guide a few days before the test that is really helpful. The material isn't easy but he prepares you properly for it. He gives an attendance code every class for a quiz so make sure you go! He has a sense of humor!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTA5NDQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?
