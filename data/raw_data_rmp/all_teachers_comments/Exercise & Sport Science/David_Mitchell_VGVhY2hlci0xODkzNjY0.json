He really wants you to succeed and will go out of his way to help.He's a fair grader, very understanding, & with good sense of humor. Book is necessary for quizzes and so is attending class if you want to do well. Had 3 labs, quiz every week, and 2 exams. Definitely recommend, great professor","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDc4ODI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
