Time managment is key. If you study 8-10 hours per daily assesment you will have no problem making an A. It all boils down to putting the necessary time in.

She really knows her stuff and it shows in her teaching.  She puts PPTs online and leaves blanks on there to fill in during class. I highly suggest this and just take side notes in class.
