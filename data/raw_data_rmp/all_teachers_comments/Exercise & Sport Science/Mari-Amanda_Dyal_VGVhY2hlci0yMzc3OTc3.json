Her quizzes are always blank and buggy and we have to  email her to fix them. The class was easy but her being unorganized was very irritating. Shes nice but it seems like teaching and grading aren't priorities to her.

Lectures are funny and all the assignments are based on each student's interested so they're not bad to complete. She is really bad at keeping up with grading - most grades were not entered until after the finals in December, so that's a downside.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDcxODY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHE4300","date_posted":"2019-10-25 07:35:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy A!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzE5MTgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHE2400","date_posted":"2019-10-25 07:33:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzE5MTc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
