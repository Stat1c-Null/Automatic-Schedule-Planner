He did not teach us any of the material but we had to teach ourselves by reading the book or you were doomed to fail. The guest speakers were nice, but I would have loved more lectures on the course material.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NjMyMTQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2100","date_posted":"2015-11-28 00:18:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"90% of the time he does not even teach. The majority of the time we have a guest speaker. Then we he does lecture he just types up a powerpoint of what the book has verbatim. The majority of the semester half of the class did not show up. That's how boring this class is.

The entire semester has been nothing but speakers and we've barely gone over the material. I personally was looking forward to learning about hotels, not the lives of those who are in the business. He expects you to teach yourself the entire book.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzYzMDIy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2300","date_posted":"2015-11-04 00:31:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had him two weeks after coming from Iceland- 1st class at KSU. Thick accent, but amazing teacher and chef. Wish I could take him again. Really learned a lot. Super helpful, and will teach you plenty about cooking. A bit of a bummer that the class you have to pass Servsafe to pass the class, but a good thing to have when it's all said and done.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzM4MjA1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2100","date_posted":"2014-11-06 10:52:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Okay professor. Material is easy but his accent is so thick you cant understand him easily and hard to keep your interest. Doesn't post the notes. So many guest speakers that for several weeks he doesn't cover any material but quizzes us on it. Have to read the chapters in the book to get a good grade.

The reason it was easy is Professor Thor takes his time to explain everything thoroughly.  He is also patient, and re-explain things over again.  If you find this class hard is because you did not show to class or ask questions.  He will not move on until everyone understands the technique properly.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDg1MDY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH2400","date_posted":"2014-05-12 13:14:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Chef Thor is an amazing teacher. He knows so much about the industry, and loves sharing his knowledge with his students. Taking notes is imperative as is attending class, but overall his class is easy as long as you do the small amount of work. Only downside is that his Icelandic accent makes him a little hard to understand at times.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjI2MDIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
