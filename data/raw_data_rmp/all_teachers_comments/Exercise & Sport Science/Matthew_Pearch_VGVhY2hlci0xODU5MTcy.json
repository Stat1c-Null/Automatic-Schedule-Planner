I did horrible (C's) on all tests, & I studied and did the study guide. To get an A, do the labs. They take less than 2 mins, are graded for completion & are combined to weigh FAR more than tests. My brother and friend failed all the tests but did all labs, & got A because of it's weight.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzM3NTMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2014-01-10 18:01:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy class, doesn't explain all the time but if you ask him to clarify, he will, otherwise he will think that you understood everything.
