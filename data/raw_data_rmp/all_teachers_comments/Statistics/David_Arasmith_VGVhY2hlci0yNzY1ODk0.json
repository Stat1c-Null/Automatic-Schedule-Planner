Easy to get in contact with and answers any questions. The class consists of one big project, the first half is the midterm, and the second half is the final. May seem daunting at first, but isn't too bad, there's plenty of time and assistance given.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzU3Njk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2022-05-05 14:38:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Arasmith is very nice and he genuinely wants you to learn. I would 100% take a class of his again because I learned a lot. if you dont understand something, just tell him and he will make sure you understand. Its a very easy class if you are good w/ the calculator and take good notes in class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjUxMTky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2022-04-27 21:51:25 +0000 UTC","comment":" He always listens to his students' concerns and changes his style if it is what they need. His homework questions directly get put onto the test so if you do the homework you will do well. He likes to talk a lot in class but I thought it was funny. I never felt overwhelmed in this class, however, I feel like I learned a lot.

They are long and a little tedious but he walks you through every step and provides a lecture manual that includes examples and instructions.

You will only be using excel for all of your work, 2 major projects but can work in groups. Doesnâ€™t really explain what most of the math means but the steps are pretty easy in excel. He answers his emails fast and is easy on grading. I would say take a statistics class first before taking this class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDIyMzI2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DATA1501","date_posted":"2022-03-24 20:11:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Arasmith is great and accessible outside class. His lectures are mostly practical exercises on Excel so make sure you are paying attention, otherwise you will get lost and will struggle with the projects.

The class overall is a pain, and while the homework is easy, the midterm project is incredibly work heavy and almost impossible to do in under a month. If you have to, take it, if you dont have to, dont.
