It almost seems like he's being forced to stand up there and lecture. His lectures are him working through worksheets. He's about as deadpan as it gets. Quizzes are Lockdown Browser and tests are in-person (but not on the D2L calendar, only on the syllabus). Don't take his class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDQyOTIy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
