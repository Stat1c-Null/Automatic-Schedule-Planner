She is amazing. She has super clear lectures, not a ton of homework, but enough that if you can do it, you will get an A on the tests. She is nice, and funny, and I truly think she is the best math teacher Ive ever had. She actually cares too. If you can, take her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDkyNjc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2017-12-07 18:21:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's fantastic. I mean. it's statistics so it's either easy or hard. But she's great at giving you extra help and you can really relate to her since she's a grad student. Much less intimidating than an Prof. Weekly short quizzes to boost your grade and if you understand the study guide you'll be in great shape.

Explains everything in detail and still has time to let you out early everyday. Also provides student notes so you don't have to draw out graphs and write notes word for word. Let's you use a notecard on all assessments. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjAyNzgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2017-04-28 13:38:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the best stat teacher at ksu! She will do everything she can to help you get an A! She gives us study guides and goes over them that exactly like the test.
