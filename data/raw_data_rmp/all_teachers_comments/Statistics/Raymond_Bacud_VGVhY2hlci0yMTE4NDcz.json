He gives homework to go along with the chapters but it is online and if you miss a question you can continue to re-try. He also gives take home quizzes and there's an in class quiz after every chapter. Take Mr. Bacud you will not regret it","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTMyMDk2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1111","date_posted":"2019-07-31 00:57:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"lots of homework but most test are exactly like the study guides he provides just the numbers change. He does move quickly through the subjects (i took during summer so that may have had something to do with it.) overall he is fair. This is not a teacher I recommend taking during the summer if you are taking 4 other classes as I did.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMTM1MDI2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

You can miss class occasionally, but you will have to read the text book to catch what you missed. Quizzes are take-home or online(2 attempts).Study guides for each test are almost identical just the numbers are replaced. A 95 average before the  final exempts you from the CUMULATIVE final exam.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjI2OTk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Every class is just him reading off the guided notes not doing much explanation. Most of his quizzes are online and some you get to take home and then turn in. If you don't miss more than 2 classes you get an extra point added to your final grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDA0NzE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MATH1107","date_posted":"2016-12-15 12:24:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Bacud is difficult to understand, and his lectures are very boring.

This course in its own was very simple. I went to class every day but did not necessarily pay attention and I got an A. His lectures are just him reading off his notes (which he emails in the beginning of the week).
