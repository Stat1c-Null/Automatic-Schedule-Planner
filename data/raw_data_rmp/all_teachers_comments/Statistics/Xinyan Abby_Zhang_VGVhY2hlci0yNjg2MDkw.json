Math Stat 1 is challenging, but her explanations were clear to the point that I understood the material. I'm just glad it was in person because next semester the class will be online and I'm not an online learner, so I'm glad I take care of it before it's too late.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDI0NTgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"stat3125","date_posted":"2024-11-27 01:06:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's easy to reach when you have questions, though assignments are easy to understand. Sometimes the lecture videos can be a little bit of a drag (no longer than 35mins though) but it's nothing hard. She walks you through a lot of the assignments, so it's hard to do badly on most of the things in this class.

Its easy to understand her, she's flexible. However, her lectures had minimum teaching on how to do the content. At times during her lecture recordings she just pauses as if she's confused or is trying to find/remember the answers.

As long as you show up you'll get an A! We use \"r-studio\", but we learn how to use that in class and it's super easy.

Can't teach at all and heavy accent. No exams either, just homeworks and projects. It's complex material, but even if you don't understand it, it's fine since you wont be graded too harshly. She can be funny and she's very nice.
