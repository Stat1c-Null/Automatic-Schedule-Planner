While she was a student teacher, she knows her stuff and treats her students well. She is always available for help and really wants to see her students succeed.

If you don't pass its simply because you weren't trying, go to class and take notes and pay attention and you'll end up with an A in the class.

Attendance is mandatory if you want an extra point at the end of the yr depends if you want it or not.
