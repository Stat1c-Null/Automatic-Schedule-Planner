I did well in the class by not even going to the lectures but by just going to tutoring every week. If you are okay with going to tutoring and teaching yourself the content because you need the credit this class is for you.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDEzNDMy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2024-11-27 00:43:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Yan is nice, but it was hard to understand him because of his accent and he talks a bit low. There were moments where it seemed like he did not know what he was doing. I think he said he was part-time. Due dates on D2L were not matching the ones on ALEKS. Total of 3 tests, FCAR quiz and a final exam.
