The quizzes and homework are fairly easy. The material itself is very introductory, not that hard at all. I loved Professor McCormick's teaching style. I definitely recommend taking this course with him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzEwMTA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

This guy is the absolute worst professor I have ever had. Good job at being horrible at your job. Do not take this class. This man just fills in notes that he makes and does not explain how he did the work. If you miss a day he will not give you missing notes even if it is...

He made the material harder than it actually was. Expects you to already know the material BEFORE you walk in class. It is like a review of the materials, not a practical learning environment. The homework makes you even more lost. I would advise if you can avoid this teacher, DO!

He is a nice guy and will help if you ask. The material itself isn't that hard but he makes it kind of confusing and as he is teaching just kind of assumes everyone understands.

He barely teaches and gets his notes off of a online website.
