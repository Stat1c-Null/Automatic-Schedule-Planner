She is so sweet and makes learning math a breeze (which says a lot coming from me). She connects with her students and offered her class through teams if you couldn't make it so you didn't fall behind. She truly wants her students to pass and tries her best to make sure they do. I HIGHLY recommend her!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzI1Mzg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1101","date_posted":"2021-10-27 17:49:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love Professor B, She is the best professor I have ever had.
