That led it to be confusing at times when the material did not apply to the group you are in. Dr Bob is nice and will set up meetings with you. He is helpful and intelligent. Take the syllabus like a grain of salt as there are errors in it and grading chgs as class goes","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzM2NTk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He made it way too advanced for an intro python course. Many of the new python users struggled a LOT in the course. He is a great person but his teaching is meh. He opens the PowerPoint or notebook and talks 100 miles an hour. Hard to keep up, but you'll pass his class for sure.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzkyNDE0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT8240","date_posted":"2021-05-14 14:26:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"VERY willing to dedicate a lot of time to helping students. He once helped me on teams with coding for over an hour. His assignments were way too vague &amp; filled with mistakes though. Need to seek out his 1 on 1 help if you want to excel, &amp; I'm 100% sure he never uploaded the right syllabus, so we had no idea of grading.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzkyMzk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT7900","date_posted":"2021-05-14 14:25:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice grader &amp; a sweet person, but just not the best professor. Constantly uploaded wrong materials with subtle typos that either gave the wrong answer or made the problem impossible to do. Not helpful through emails, but he's willing to video chat to help. Bit sassy at times. You'll pass, but with tons of confusion &amp; frustration.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzkyMzg5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Skip class?
