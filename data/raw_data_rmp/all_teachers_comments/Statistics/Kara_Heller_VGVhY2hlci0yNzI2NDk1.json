She's super understanding, and as she says, she cares about your grade if you show that you care about your grade. You're able to exempt the final if you have a 95% overall and I easily managed a 97. As long as you show up to class and take half decent notes, you'll be fine!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDg2NTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

I suck at math and she made this class so easy for me. She truly cares about you and made me want to come to class every time and it was actually fun.

She was new at her job, and was ver caring. But when it came to the homework, it was ridiculous! It felt like it was doing homework at home 4 days a week, roughly an hour a day. The final review had 47 questions, but not even half on the actual final. Poor way of doing things that was unfair for the students.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDQwOTQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Caring--Test heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2021-12-03 03:53:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was new, however it felt like she leaned on us and we leaned on her. She's very sweet and personable. She's young so it's very easy to relate to her. Assignments are done on Alecs. She provides all necessary material you need, and the videos on Alecs help ALOT so watch them. If you have 95 or above your exempted from the final exam.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzU2MzAz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1401","date_posted":"2021-12-02 16:39:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Kata Heller is an awesome professor.
