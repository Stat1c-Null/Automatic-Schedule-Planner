Her meetings are useful and she makes sure that everybody understands the unit before moving on. But the quiz and test can throw people off.

She tried her best to explain confusing STATS concepts so that a 3rd grader would understand it. There were 3 tests, 8 online quizzes, a sizeable chunk of ConnectMath hw and a final exam. She offered EC for taking a general assessment. I got a D (which is passing for non-major classes!)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTIyMTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
