You don't have to take his final if you don't want to & allows you to makeup whatever test you want at the end of the semester. He gives homework and quizzes, but nothing too over the top.

The best professor I've had by far. He is very laidback and likeable.

He knows this is an intro class and teaches as so. He makes it clear of whats going to be on the test that you can only fail if you honestly dont try at all.
