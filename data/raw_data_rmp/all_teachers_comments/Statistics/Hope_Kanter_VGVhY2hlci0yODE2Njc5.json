A lot of the lectures different from the aleks homework in some way, which leads you to have to teach yourself. Also all tests are on lockdown browser with a camera.

She is very nice. However, she is not at all helpful. Her teaching style is very confusing, so much so that going to class regresses my understanding of the topics.
