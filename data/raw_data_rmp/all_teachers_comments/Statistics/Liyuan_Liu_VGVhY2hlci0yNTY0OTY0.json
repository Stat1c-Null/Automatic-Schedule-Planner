Although the tests were open notes, I would say that studying and staying on top of your work is essential. If you pay attention, you will do fine. There are homework assignments for every chapter and 2 tests. Overall, an easy class, and Dr. Liu is super friendly and understanding.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDM1NzM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DSS210","date_posted":"2022-11-08 17:32:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her at St. Joe's and she is by far the best stats teacher available. She is super nice and caring and super minimal work - open book midterm and final and she goes over a test review packet that are very similar to the actual exam. And she does all the hw with you. Only problem is she is sometimes a little hard to understand but not bad.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Nzk2MDQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Lecture heavy--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STATS1401","date_posted":"2020-05-11 00:59:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Liu was a good teacher. Great personality! She communicates well &amp; does the best she can to teach. Paying attention is vital and fully understanding it is as well. Do not treat it as a minimal effort class since it requires you to put effort in stuff such as the HW. She is always willing to do her best to help out if you simply ask.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjU4Nzk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?
