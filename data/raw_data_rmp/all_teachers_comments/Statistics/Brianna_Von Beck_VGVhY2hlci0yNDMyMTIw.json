I had no trouble on the test and barely studied. She is very nice when answering questions .It is 3 test and a final plus homework. The final can be used to replace your lowest test grade and if you have a 95 average you dont have to take the final.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjUxMjE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STAT1107","date_posted":"2018-11-29 14:49:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Alexis is great! She's a graduate student teacher here and she's very understanding. If you miss less than two classes she'll bump your grade if you're on the edge, but you won't want to miss class. It's never a waste of time and she's always there to answer any questions! Print out the notes before class &amp; keep up with online HW and study!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODE1ODQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--EXTRA CREDIT--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
