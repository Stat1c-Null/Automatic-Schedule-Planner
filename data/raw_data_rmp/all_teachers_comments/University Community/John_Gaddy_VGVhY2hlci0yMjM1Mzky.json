Three easy papers, (2-3) pages, 7 discussion post, and a 10 question final (EASY). I would look forward to taking his classes again, but I graduate next semester and his classes are booked! Im glad I got to experience a easy going professor. Take him, you can't loose!!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTg3ODA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS2200","date_posted":"2017-12-18 00:34:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Gaddy is so nice! It was an online class so I didn't interact with him much, but whenever you turn in an assignment he provides positive feedback. He is very reasonable and respected. He pushed back an assignment deadline for the whole class just because one student asked him too. There's no way you can't get an A in this class. Take him!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjUyNDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3600","date_posted":"2017-06-29 15:54:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"LDRS 3600 Dr. Gaddy is an amazing professor! Very tenative, caring and positive feedback. The book is needed for a few assignments, class is very doable for a 4 week online class, or short semester. I enjoyed this class very much, and the discussions! Weekly discussions, 2 responses, a few short m/c test, an few reviews/analysis writings.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDk2MTAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3800","date_posted":"2017-04-26 15:46:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really great online class. Each week is just a discussion post, there's a midterm and a final and then two article reviews. That's all the grades. If you do your weekly posts and write decent papers, this class is a breeze.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTMzNDg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
