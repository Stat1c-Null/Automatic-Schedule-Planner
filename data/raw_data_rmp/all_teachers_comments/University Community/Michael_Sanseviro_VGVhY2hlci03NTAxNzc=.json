He gives you the inside scoop about ksu and he truly cares about his students. He doesn't take attendance after the first few weeks but I would recommend going atleast one a week so he remembers who you are and at the end of the semester he will bump you up.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjEwOTQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Hilarious--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1200","date_posted":"2014-11-06 14:17:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Michael is a great teacher for the first year course.

He really knows what he's talking about and gives you behind the scenes information because he is a Dean. Also very funny- keeps class interesting.

He also has a pretty good sense of humor. Class was fun and interactive: a couple of group projects, a few easy quizes, an easy midterm & final, extra credit essay.
