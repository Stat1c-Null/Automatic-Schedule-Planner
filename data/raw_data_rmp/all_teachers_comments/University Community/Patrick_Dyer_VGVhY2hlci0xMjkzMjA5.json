You have to give a mock interview in front of the class as one of his assignment, but its a small class size. For those who don't like talking in front of crowds, you will have to give speeches and reports in some of your other classes eventually so this is a good time to warm up to the idea of it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTUyMTI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2011-11-08 17:28:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Interesting man, good at what he does and he does a good job making it interesting.
