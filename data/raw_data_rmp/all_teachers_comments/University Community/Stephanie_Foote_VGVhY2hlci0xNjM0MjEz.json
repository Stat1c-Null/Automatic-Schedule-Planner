The tests are a little tough, but I recommend taking this class online! She is a very nice and helpful professor.

There was a midterm as well as a final. There is a lot of reading and videos that you have to take notes on. There is no review guides for the the two exams. I made an A but it was, by no means, an easy A.Good Luck.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDc0MTA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1111","date_posted":"2012-12-17 11:44:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great professor. She is helpful and clear on what she wants you to do. She demands a lot of work but she grades fairly. The midterm and final can be difficult so study! They are very similar though. A lot of outside reading though, make sure to take notes on them. You watch a lot of videos. Make sure to take notes on them also.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDk3NzM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1111","date_posted":"2012-11-05 22:37:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Foote is a great first year teacher. She makes sure that the class is following along, as well as getting to know each student. The class consists mainly of group work, and discussion. Speak up! She creates awkwards silences if you don't. She grades fairly, and is extremely friendly. The books were used quite frequently.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzgzMTQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2011-12-27 23:00:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"EASY CLASS..we did 2 projects and the rest of the time we had pointless class discussions and presenters.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NjMwNTg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2011-11-29 15:04:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took the hybrid which I highly recommend.
