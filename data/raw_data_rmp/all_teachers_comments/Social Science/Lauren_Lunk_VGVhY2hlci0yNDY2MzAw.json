Only annoying this is she never responded to my many emails, and waited until literally the last week to put in grades and didn't round up my 79.36. If you do the work she is a pretty easy grader.

I would 100% recommend this class to anyone that has to take sociology classes or wants them as elective classes. She is a great professor and the content in her class made this my favorite class I have taken this far. I would highly recommend you take her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzEyODQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3324","date_posted":"2021-04-29 01:42:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class is pretty straight forward and easy to get through as long as you participate. there are weekly discussion posts & quizzes that are pretty extensive but theres only 2 exams & 2 papers. She does take awhile to grade. The textbook is also a MUST to do well in her class, it provides so much for her weekly quizzes.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjUzMTI3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI1101","date_posted":"2020-11-16 18:29:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is an easy A for quizzes, but you have to put in some extra work for discussion prompts and assignments. She kind of sucks at responding and when she does, it's pretty lazy. &quot;Hey, you messed this up on the assignment instructions.&quot; And she'll say back, &quot;Oops! Will fix later.&quot; Unreliable, but you don't really need her for the class at all","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODI0OTMz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOC3364","date_posted":"2019-12-15 21:47:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took Prof Lunk Spring '19 and it was immensely frustrating. Hardly responded to emails. Didn't grade anything until the last week. Messed up on grading a lot. Hopefully it was just an off semester for her and she isn't usually like that because it was the worst experience I had at KSU. Class was easy but don't expect any help/involvement from her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjY4OTE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SOCI3364","date_posted":"2019-04-18 21:13:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"The course is relatively easy with weekly quizzes/discussions. The problem I have with this professor is she takes FOREVER to grade papers. Still waiting for her to grade a short 2-3 page paper that we turned in over a month ago. She also pushed another paper deadline back 3 hours before it was due because she didnt respond to any emails all week.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjI1NjQ2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SOCI3364","date_posted":"2019-03-01 14:14:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very detailed. Weekly discussions and timed quizzes. The structure of the questions on the quizzes are confusing! And its set up to trick you! Very hard! Only gives you 10mins to respond to 10 questions! I didnt like that at all. Lots of pressure. There is a midterm, a final exam, and 2 papers. And I didnt agree with her feedback most times.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMzk1MDQ4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
