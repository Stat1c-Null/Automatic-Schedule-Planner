She requires you to read 25-50 pages in your book a week, on random science articles, and have a summary prepared over the reading to discuss in class, which she takes for attendance. She can however be very vague in what she wants.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODcyMzY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"STS1101","date_posted":"2018-10-04 00:09:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's pretty clear on what she expects, if you actually take the time to do the work and read her syllabus it should be a breeze. Attendance isn't technically mandatory, but she likes to randomly collect reports on the topics so you basically need to show up for every class. Usually pretty understanding, especially if you put in effort.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTQxODYx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
