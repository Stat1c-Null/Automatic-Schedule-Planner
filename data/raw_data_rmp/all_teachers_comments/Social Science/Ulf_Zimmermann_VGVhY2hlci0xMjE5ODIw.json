I enjoyed his lectures, as well as his somewhat laid back attitude; but DO NOT take this for granted. He is also very challenging, but fair. I appreciated the feedback on my papers and the opportunity that he gave me to receive a better grade. I would take any class with him!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDA2ODEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAD7130","date_posted":"2011-01-14 11:11:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"I think he's a great professor.

I have no advise to offer, but one thing I will say is that the entire final grade is curved. Yes the whole class was &quot;failing&quot; but curves are meant to pass a percentage.Nice man, if you need help go to his office, he can talk for hours.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NjkzNTgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2010-01-06 22:36:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice and funny professor but strays of topic constantly during his lectures.

The other 10% is based on an essay. His lectures are a joke. He simply stands in front of the class and rants. It is impossible to tell what is info you need and what is just useless knowledge. He doesnt prepare you for the tests at all.
