This class was so easy I would 100% recommend taking it. You do end up doing group work which sucks when it's online. But the class is so easy if you get a bad group it's annoying but doesn't matter. It's about one discussion a week and hardly any test.

Final paper due at the semester. Overall the class felt unorganised probably cause this is her first semester. She was a lenient grader. Assignments and Quizzes were easy and quiz were based off the reading.

Very group project heavy except for the final. Lots of extra credit given and super easy, as long as you get the work done. Doesn't respond to emails that often and grades do take a while to go in. Nice professor and I enjoyed the course!
