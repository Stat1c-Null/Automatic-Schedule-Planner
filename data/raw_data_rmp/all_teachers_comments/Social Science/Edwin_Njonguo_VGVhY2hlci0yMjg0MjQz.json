One time he let us move a due date back and gave us an extra credit for a movie. The actual class was.. eh. Many people dropped, and I don't blame them. He expects everyone to read a bunch of readings but hardly anyone did. It's not all that hard, but I wouldn't take him or the class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDI5ODA3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--Tests?

Boring, long, lectures. Hard to understand. Lots of busy work. Pop quizzes, papers, reading, and group projects. He hadn't submitted any grades by the last day to withdraw and kept giving the the runaround about midterm grades so I had to withdraw. He seems very nice but the class was a joke.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NzE1Nzk0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--GROUP PROJECTS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
