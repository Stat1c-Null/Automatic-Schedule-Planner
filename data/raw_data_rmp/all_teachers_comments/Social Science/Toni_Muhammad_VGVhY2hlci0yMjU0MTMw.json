She assigned us an extensive case study and gave us 3 days to do the assignment. The assignment has not clear directions, which is very normal for her. Her discussion questions did not make sense most of the time. Never take her.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTg1ODky","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
