Like expecting a complete summary of a country with political parties and major events in a single page, and will take off major points if you fall short which is sometimes unavoidable. Otherwise not too bad but I cant really recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDk5MTgz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2240","date_posted":"2016-05-02 18:54:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mixed feelings about Amanda. Shes super nice and has interesting lectures. But her grading system is kind of wonky I think. Especially with the presentations. If you go over time (which is easy to do) she takes off serious points. Doesnt make it clear what she is looking for in those and will take off points there as well. Would take again though.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDQxMDU1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2240","date_posted":"2015-11-10 14:42:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have the utmost respect for Professor Guidero. She's a genuinely nice person and one of the only professors that I would consider a friend. Really good at getting information across and helping you if you need any help. More teachers should be like her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzgxNjgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2280","date_posted":"2015-07-14 02:30:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Cares about her students and will talk to after class if you have any questions!!!

Your grade consists of a midterm, a final, 6 quizzes, and 2 easy essay assignments. She offers quite a bit of extra credit too. Very pleased with this course, would take her again.
