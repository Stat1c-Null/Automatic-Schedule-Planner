Two assignments (a paper and a presentation)due throughout the year and a midterm and final exam. The discussions aren't difficult but do require just a little more effort than copying what is in the text book. Very fair grader.

Course had 4 Discussions, 8 quizzes, and 7 written assignments. The written assignment weren't really essays though. Maybe one to two pages of work and citations really wasn't hard at all.

She is very nice and funny. It is recommended to read the book, but it is not needed in order to get an A in the class. She does take attendance.

Her classes are never boring, especially when she plays John Oliver when he discusses the issues we are covering in class. One pop quiz a week, and if you make all A's, you get an automatic A on your midterm/final. Theres also a group project that is presented each week and is a big part of your grade.
