We had an individual project and a group project that was most of the grade. You could go to the professor for feedback regarding your projects before they were due so you can improve them. Super understanding and caring. I hate coding, but I loved this class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzA2NTY2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCID3400","date_posted":"2023-07-20 19:48:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"You MUST take Professor Phillip's class. He is kind, caring, funny, and knowledgeable about the subject matter. He helped students who were falling behind get back on track and provided additional resources for those who were more advanced. He does not have a bunch of busy work due every week, just a few projects over the course of the semester.
