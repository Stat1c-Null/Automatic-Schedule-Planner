Professor Scott is extremely laid back and a quick grader! Assignments arent difficult and if you try you will do perfectly fine. He assigned two modules at a time and gave us near a month to complete. The two modules include a short paper and a quiz and can be done in 30 min.

Do not even hesitate. Professor Scott is not a tough grader by any means but you will be writing short papers every other week. It switches off between discussion posts one week, and the next week is a paper. (min 2 pages double spaced, not that hard). There are quizzes over the material.
