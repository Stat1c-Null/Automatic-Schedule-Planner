The 2 exams consist of easy multiple choice (as long as you study the slides) and a written exam portion that is not that bad. She makes you read small portions of the textbook for in class discussion and writing assignments. Easy extra credit also available, would recommend","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTA1NjQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Failed this class the first time and she made it easy to pass. Two map quizzes, two test (gives you a study guide) and a primary sources assignment. She's very clear & concise and you will never not know what is expected of you. She's one of my favorite professors I've had.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMzUyMjYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
