I normally do not go based off of rate my professor since I normally am I straight A student, but she is making that almost impossible. Her tests are actually impossible, and her quizzes are even worse. If you even want to pass do not take her. I could go on and on about her, and she does nothing to help.

I have never left a review before and I've had multiple difficult professors in the past but she is by far the most difficult I've ever had. The weekly quizzes were lockdown webcam, no notes, 11 min for 11 questions, some written response, and worth 70% of your grade. Take anyone else if you care about your grade.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDA0MDYz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIO3340L","date_posted":"2023-09-28 16:38:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lab is easy enough, but makes getting a good grade more difficult than other micro lab sections. Pre lab quizzes are 70% of your grade, they are lockdown + webcam, no noted allowed and free response sections. The lab manuals that the quizzes are on are very lengthy.

Your answers to her quizzes could be identical to what she says in her own lab manual as well as other students, yet she'll still mark your response wrong.
