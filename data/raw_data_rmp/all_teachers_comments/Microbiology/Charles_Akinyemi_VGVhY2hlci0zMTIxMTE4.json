Gives good feedback and will ensure every student understands the material/procedure. Can be difficult to understand/follow when explaining things. Very easygoing and lenient.

Great professor who truly wants you to succeed.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjYzMDYx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
