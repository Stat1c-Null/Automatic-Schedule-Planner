The instructor can come across as dismissive or unapproachable when questions are asked. Overall, support is limited, and it would be helpful if more study resources were made available.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjMzMjI5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2025-03-31 16:23:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor!

Easy class to pass if you pay any amount of attention to the room. Not many grades though, the syllabus says there is only a midterm, and a final, but if you just go to class, it's really hard to fail.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODIwMzgy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2024-11-30 21:02:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take this Professor I have finished the class and she hasn't graded an assignment since early September and it is now December.

Lectures are just reading off of a pre-made textbook powerpoint with little explanation. Tests are also heavy and very effort-some with lack of multiple choice.

Beware, kinesthetic and visual learners may not do as well because she talks way too much and doesn't give sufficient practice. Gives very little information about what is truly on quizzes. Study guides are a list of vocabulary words that are not discussed thoroughly. No thanks.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4Mjc2OTY2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
