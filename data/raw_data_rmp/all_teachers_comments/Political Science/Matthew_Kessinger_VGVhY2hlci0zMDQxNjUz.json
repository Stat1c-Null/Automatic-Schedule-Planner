The content is easy to follow through videos. He is very caring and helpful. People are doing their introduction syllabus week discussion (4 months overdue) and still receiving some partial credit.. Take him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDYzMTM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2025-03-13 00:57:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"A really awesome professor and very kind towards his students. His grading criteria is very clear and he's really understanding if you need an extension or help with an assignment..I struggled with an essay prompt and he helped me come up with some things to write about. There is an essay every two weeks, so be ready to type!

His D2L is set up by the week so you'll know exactly what's due and he sends reminders all the time. He gives good feedback on papers and he really cares about your learning. Just put in effort and you will succeed! I definitely recommend taking him","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMzc5NTgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2024-12-05 16:00:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"I believe this was Kessinger's first year teaching!  He is an amazing guy.  He truly seems to care about his students and wants them to succeed.  He is a tough grader for writing assignments.
