There are pop quizzes, but its over the assigned reading. Also, he explains well what will be on every test including the final. You learn a lot in his class that will help you out in life like negotiations and resolving conflict.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTQ2MjU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAX1102","date_posted":"2018-05-05 16:14:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not a fan. Lectures are hard to follow, rarely uses powerpoints, pop quizzes over material not yet covered in class. Assigns arbitrary groups at the beginning based on where you sit that remain for the rest of the semester. Not very clear what he wanted us to study for the final. Literally made us read his thesis. Also, he has a very thick accent.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTk2NDQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":9,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PAX1102","date_posted":"2018-01-11 18:55:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love this guy. This was my favorite class. He teaches beautifully and intertwines interesting group projects. Little to no homework and if you are engaged in class it is super easy. He cares abt his students and helps apply the concepts to real life. He always asks for feedback on how he can improve his teaching. Tests are easy.

He thoroughly explains everything, multiple times if necessary. His teaching style makes the class easy and enjoyable. If you pay even a little attention in class then his already easy tests will be a breeze. Hes also a great people person and very down to earth.

If you follow it and get ahead of the game, then you will be fine in class when it comes to discussion and participation.  If the majority of the class shows that they did not read the assigned chapters per the syllabus then he gives pop quizzes so read up and you will be fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NjAzMjYw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAX1102","date_posted":"2016-12-08 01:00:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really cool guy, class was very inspirational.
