However, on our first test on a class of over 100, the average grade was 60. His questions were just worded very tricky, you had 4 questions and one word separated the difference between it being right and wrong. The tests are multiple choice. Good teacher, difficult wording on tests.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MDg5MDE1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2007-11-28 20:26:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"good teacher, sometimes can get a little confusing if you don't pay attention.  Two papers, two tests. MUST study for the tests! He is willing to spend time and help if it is needed.  never pushes his views and is very open to discussion and questions.  great personality, easy class.  Can be a little boring sometimes. I would recomend this class!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNzE1OTU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
