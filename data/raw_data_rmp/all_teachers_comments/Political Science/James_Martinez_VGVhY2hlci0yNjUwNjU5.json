Graded on 10 quizzes and 4 tests which are all online and really easy. Some stuff from those come from things he said in class but if u want to just skip class everyday u can still get an A or B just look up the answers. The textbook isnt required","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDEzNTg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2021-01-14 01:24:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Martinez was really enjoyable. There were some long lectures (some 2 hours) but he is very clear with the material. There were discussion posts and weekly quizzes, and three tests. He was clear on what he expected from the posts, and gave you feedback if you missed something. I recommend his class and would take again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Mjc0ODI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
