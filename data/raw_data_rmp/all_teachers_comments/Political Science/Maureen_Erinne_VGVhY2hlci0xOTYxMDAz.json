Many people told me that this was a difficult class but with her online class, i made an A easily! The class grades consist of 3 test, discussion posts every week, and a quiz every week. The tests are very easy and on the quizzes, you get 3 attempts to get a good great. Would take again!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTIxNDEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2015-12-24 15:03:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor is fair in her grading. Like other professors you have to do the work. I got a high B because I did B quality work. She knows a lot about American Politics but a lot more about international stuff.  She had us thinking on a different level. Her finals are no joke. But to her credit she provided us with a study guide. Overall, I like her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODIwMDg3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2015-05-12 12:25:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"I think she knows are stuff. She is very knowledgeable about the subject . I loved the extra credit opportunities. She does have long powerpoints which guided a bulk of my studying. She requires class participation by talking about what was going on in the news. I actually learned a lot. She's nice, helpful but you got to do the work. I got a B.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODA3OTI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2015-01-14 18:43:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class requires some effort. Yes, she tells you to study questions at the back of every chapter for her quizzes , but you really have to put in a lot more effort for her exams. I thinks a smaller class size would have helped. Having 90 students in a class is no joke. I got an A  because I studied. I would recommend her to anyone.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Mjg4NTk0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2015-01-06 12:20:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"She spends every day in class staring at the power point just reading it off and before ever quiz and test she would just tell us to read the questions in the back of the book and we would be fine. No one believed her at first but they literally were just those questions until the final. She completely screws you over with the final.

Reads straight from a powerpoint that is posted online. There is only two tests. The first one is easy because the questions come straight from the questions at the end of each chapter. HOWEVER, she WILL tell you to study those questions for the final but only 20 of those questions will be on the final.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTI4NjA0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1100","date_posted":"2014-12-15 23:59:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Only 4 quizzes in all, memorize the practice test questions at the end of chapters as they are exactly the same. Only 2 tests in class, and requires attendance. I ended the class with a high A with minimum effort while not reading a single chapter. Caveat: shes monotonous, reads straight from the ppts.
