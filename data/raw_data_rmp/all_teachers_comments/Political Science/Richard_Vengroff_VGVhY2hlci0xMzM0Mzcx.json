He is so informative and helpful. i learned so much by attending his classes. he asks for weekly journals about specific topics but the good thing about that is there is no wrong answer as long as you do the work. I would highly recommend talking this class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDA5MzMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2240","date_posted":"2011-02-18 11:17:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst teacher I have ever had. There is a lot of work he assigns weekly that is pretty much pointless. He teaches the class as if this is the only class we were taking during a semester. Ridiculous. He also does not follow the syllabus rules or I would have dropped the class during drop/add. He posts discussions and makes them due like 2 days after","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MjM5ODY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS4490","date_posted":"2010-05-28 19:00:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was an extremely interesting class. Dr. Vengroff made it very enjoyable and easy. There was a group project (which is a lot of fun). Make sure you read books and come to classes to do well on the exams. There is one paper on a policy. Exams are online and open-book. If you don't know anything about Canada, this is the class you should take.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjgxMjA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3334","date_posted":"2010-04-20 11:37:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Comparative Politics. He gives great explanations and you know exactly what to expect from the tests. He has a few class activities which are interesting. There is a paper in which we follow a country which he grades rather easily.
