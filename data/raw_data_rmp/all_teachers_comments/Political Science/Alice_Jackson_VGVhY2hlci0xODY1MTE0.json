Get a hard copy, she wont let you use the ebook. Doesn't allow you to type your notes or use your laptop, she wants them handwritten. Gives out &quot;assignments&quot; that look really similar to the test. Do them, they help.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODcyNTIx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2017-09-26 16:13:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"She lectures the whole class giving you so so so much information so quickly that you do not have time to write hardly anything down. She tells you to read parts of your textbook but when you take the test the information on the test doesn't come from your book it comes from her lectures. She lost my first test!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Njk4NDM5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2014-05-03 19:09:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"It was an easy class, not thanks to the professor.  Often did not use powerpoints, when she did she just read directly from them.  Did not seem to know the material well.

Remember people we are in college and there will be work that is due. 4 or 5 tests with one of them being a take home. She is a cool teacher just go to class. At times the assignments can be a little vague, she will clarify if asked","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDQ5NTgy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2013-12-14 11:04:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wow, she is bad.  She is nice, but really does not know her subject.  She refuses to post her power points on D2L. She can't explain, only read from the book. Her \"handouts\" often create more confusion.  She talks during the tests and seems to have no confidence. She cancelled class several times.
