Exams were easy, they were essay questions and you got the question at least two weeks before it was due, open book and notes. At first I felt that I wasn't learning  bc his lectures are scattered but it did make me more aware of  global and national politics.

He is scatter-brained and unorganized but is a nice man. He wastes a lot of class time with BS. IT'S HARD TO MAKE AN A! I work hard and still got a B on most assignments. Tests are essay format and we are allowed to bring an outline and use the book. I found him funny- some students thought he was annoying.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDI1ODk1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
