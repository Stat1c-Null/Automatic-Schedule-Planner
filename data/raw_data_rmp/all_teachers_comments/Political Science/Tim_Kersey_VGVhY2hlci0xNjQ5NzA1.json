The test content comes straight from his power points. You do not need the textbook. He is a jokester so be prepared haha he sometimes gives extra credit points for attending class, so go! The tests are not hard. He explains the content well and if he is not feeling in the mood to teach he cuts class short!

I studied hard for the tests so I passed all of them with either a low A or a high B. His quizzes are hard. Failed only one with a 60. The rest I got As and Bs. Go to class because he offers extra credit for it. As long as you study you'll be fine.

His online quizzes are hard, the tests are some what ok. He has recommended daily readings for the book, but I just use the power points and my notes to study for the tests and quizzes.
