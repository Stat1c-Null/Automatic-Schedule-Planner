You cant make over a 90 on his discussion posts in the NGO class and youre graded by a few things. Im sure hes a nice dude, but make sure you do well on all your assignments because one can make or break your final grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTgzOTgz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Graded by few things--So many papers","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS4490","date_posted":"2020-12-17 14:53:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was so hard, and it is basically built to where a top grade is a B. The discussion post is weighted most heavily - basicallty 50% of your overall grade, but the highest grade you can even make on them is a 90. This sets you up to where it becomes nearly impossible to make an A the moment you don't make a perfect disc. post.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTE5Mzkw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS2250","date_posted":"2020-05-05 12:51:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"I knew Id like Professor Pallas from day 1. This is a discussion based class instead of lecture based, which was a really nice change of pace. Hes extremely understanding about any personal things and just wants you to understand what hes teaching. The first half is learning and the second half is application. Also the essays are terrible for IA","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjA1NzE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS4490","date_posted":"2018-12-13 19:46:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Outstandingly nice guy.

He is extremely knowledgable about IR, and he certainly does push you to learn the material. He wants the class to be engaged and separates the class into small groups for discussions. He also spent an hour+ with me in his office going over how to apply the theories to real world problems.

He definitely knows his material and tries to make sure his students understand. Grades papers a bit difficult, but allows a re-write on the midterm.
