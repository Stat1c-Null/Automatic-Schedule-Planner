He is very scattered when he lectures so taking notes is impossible. He tests on concepts so just do your research, pay attention and talk to him. He's a nice guy and will do anything for students.

He likes his job and he cares for his students by taking time to talk to each of them out of class. He is also the first teacher to actually make me want to try harder and not have to. He is tough but understanding when it comes to grades.  I recommend.
