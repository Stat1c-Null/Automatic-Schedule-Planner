Whether you agree with his political takes or his interpretations of the Constitution or not, just use whatever was in his lessons on your papers and youll pass just fine. Holding my tongue when I disagreed with his political stances was the only challenging part of this course.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTY0NjMw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Lecture heavy--So many papers","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2018-02-14 23:16:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"He knows what hes talking about for sure and brings in cool guest speakers if hes gone but lectures arent consistent.

However, he has an uncanny ability to make an interesting topic as dry as stale toast. He relies heavily on his assistant Barry who does everything Bob should be doing. He provides no visual aid for his lectures, and doesn't allow you to record them either.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTE4NTAy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2017-03-27 12:41:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"It's always cool to take a poli sci class with a former congressman.
