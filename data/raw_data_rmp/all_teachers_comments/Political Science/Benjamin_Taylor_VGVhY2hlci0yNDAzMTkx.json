You will spend hours working on a paper for this class and no matter how good you think it is, he will still give you an F or maybe a barely passing grade on a good day.

He's also VERY understanding of how lazy college kids are and curves/grades/drops things appropriately.

You have weekly quizzes online on the textbook chapters but can use quizlet for them, they are like 30% of your grade. He takes attendance with Kahoot (10% of grade) but forgets it rather often. He is funny which makes his lectures interesting.
