Clearly not interested in actually teaching her students. She was the most BORING and uninteresting teacher ever. When she decided to grade tests she was tough. Always on her phone instead of teaching. She was given many nicknames and none were good. Avoid her class!!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDg3Njg2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POL1101","date_posted":"2020-12-30 01:44:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly, she isn't the best not the worst. She would show up late everyday to class and always end the class early. She never reply's to emails, I sent her an email in September and till this day she hasn't responded to me back. The test and quizzes are open book and are easy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjE0OTIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2020-12-15 19:21:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was easy, but the bad thing was HER attendance. Most days she would come in late and leave early. To some thats nice, but for others its bad. There have been lectures that last 10 minutes. Also, VERY slow to grade anything. For example, there was a project that was due 9/24, and still isnt graded (its 12/15). I would NOT reccomend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDg0OTk2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2020-12-14 06:04:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easiest class I've ever taken. All quizzes and tests are open book online (because of covid). She showed up at least 10 minutes late every class and released us 20-30 minutes early.

We took all quizzes and tests online. The main issues with this professor: 1.)Over 200 question tests with 1 hr1/2 time to take them. 2.)Lying about providing certain things for students. 3.) She said, &quot;Well no one is failing yet by mid semester so I must not being difficult enough.&quot; DOES NOT CARE","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDU4MjAw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

There is a bit of reading and her lectures move a bit fast all I can say is TAKE NOTES!!! She gives you more than enough opportunities to up your grade than any professor I've had. She is extremely caring and has an overwhelming understanding for the working student. She never keeps you the full class period.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTM0MzEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
