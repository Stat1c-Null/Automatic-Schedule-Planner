He offered 3 extra credit opportunities throughout the semester, but gave us an extra one to help our grades. Make sure to study for the tests; they are difficult, but not impossible. Also, attendance isn't mandatory, but he does give quizzes that reflect your grade!

Mixes lectures up with videos so you don't get too bored. No in class tests, just take home tests, they can be a little tricky, but with research its not too bad.
