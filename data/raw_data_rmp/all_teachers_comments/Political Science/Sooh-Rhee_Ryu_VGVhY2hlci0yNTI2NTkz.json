Completely asynchronous and easy to follow along. I gave this professor a 4 just because I never met them or heard their voice. It was a bit detached, and I would've enjoyed getting to know them more. Kinda scary because the only test was the final, but it is open book.

She is honestly so helpful and her class is extremely easy if you stay on top of your work. Each week there are 5 assignments due (extremely easy) and she is very lenient on grading.
