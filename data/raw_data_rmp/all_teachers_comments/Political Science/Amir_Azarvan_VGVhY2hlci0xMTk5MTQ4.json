Very straightforward examinations, makes class fun. Discussion posts are simple grades, and his term paper is not as daunting as it seems: just try your best to be impartial and non-biased (I received a 100% on it). He really values \"getting all sides\" on issues, and not appearing to take one side or another.

He is a professor that really wants his students to understand what he is teaching. Nothing is easy in this class, you must apply yourself and your knowledge. Duh its college.

He does count for attendance, so don't miss too many days. As long as you study the powerpoint slides and read the small sections that he lists on the study guide, you will make an A.
