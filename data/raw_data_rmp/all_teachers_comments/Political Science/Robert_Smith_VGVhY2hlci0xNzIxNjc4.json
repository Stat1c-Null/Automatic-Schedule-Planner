He graded the written assignments easier than I expected him to, which was wonderful because the majority of our overall grade was from written assignments. Although it took a lot of time and diligence, the class was not hard to follow and I never felt lost.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMDI3OTU1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2201","date_posted":"2013-03-30 18:11:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took him for Intro To Public Administration... not the most fascinating teacher, but he's good. He teaches and tests fairly. Also, he's the chair of the Political Science Department--and he's a fair man who listens and will help solve problems with other PolySci professors. He's a good man and well deserves his position.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDY2MDYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2013-02-19 21:43:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"He really wants everyone to understand the material and I love him as a person.

The workload was light and his notes were very clear. I highly reccomend his class and would gladly take it again although I have no interest in the subject.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTM2Mjgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3343","date_posted":"2012-05-23 13:51:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Smith is very knowledgable about the subject matter, but tends to go off topic frequently, and at times it is hard to understand the point he is trying to make.
