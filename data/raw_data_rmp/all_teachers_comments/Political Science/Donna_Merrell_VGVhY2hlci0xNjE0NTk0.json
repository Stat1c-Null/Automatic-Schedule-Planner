She knows most students are only in the course because it's required so attendance was not mandatory. She gives a study guide and tells all the answers to it the class day before the test. The study  guide is the test exactly. I only went the day before the test and test days and made a high A!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjE2MTEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3370","date_posted":"2013-05-10 11:03:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher. Attendance is MANDATORY. I did not know this and I lowered my grade a full letter; my fault though as it says it in the syllabus. Great professor- I would take her again no doubt. She is very unbiased too. Though I know she loves Lincoln, I don't know if she is Republican or Democrat. Awesome professor.

She makes class easy, VERY clear, and worth taking. You will learn things in her class but she makes the discussions interesting and funny. As long as you complete your study guides you are good for your tests.

The student who complained about create a party is very incorrect. The project taught me more about how political parties operate then learning their history (which I've seen before in other classes).

She introduced this new Create a Party thing that was utterly useless. Instead of learning about political parties, we spent most of the time pretending to be in one and holding elections.
