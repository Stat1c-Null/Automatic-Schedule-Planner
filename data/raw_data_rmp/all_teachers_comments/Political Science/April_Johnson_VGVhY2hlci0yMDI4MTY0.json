You have a midterm and a final (for summer class) and she gives you study guides for both.  You will have weekly homework assignments due 24 hours in advance but they're usually posted by Friday or Saturday so you can do both of them then.  HIGHLY recommend Mrs. Johnson.

If you miss homework you cannot make it up. Does not matter if you pay attention in class because you will find yourself using google to study for her only two exams.

Its not particularly difficult but its really annoying having an assignment always due. Its seven research assignments building up to one major paper (15+ pages) and a presentation and she makes you use SPSS which is a very hard to use program. She is a very, very easy grader though.

She's an easy grader and gives extra credit towards each paper. If you do the paper you'll get an A. She brought snacks to class too. The only bad thing is that attendance is part of your grade and her lectures are on material you don't get tested over so it's boring to sit in.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzM5Njg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2015-12-20 11:25:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Johnson's class taught me a lot.
