The class seems difficult due to the lack of clarity in instruction and absence of application, but it really isn't. Put some effort into the 8 homework assignments, use key-words from the powerpoints in your paper, and look over the last 3 homework assignments/in-class handouts for the final.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzAxNTE5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"RESEAMETH","date_posted":"2011-11-15 21:30:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is not difficult to understand and does help a lot. She has given NO information on what our final will be over. It's VERY frustrating as we have a final that gives the majority of our grade and have no information on it. She gives assignments that you MUST complete on-site, which is a challenge.

For my class we actually only spent 3 weeks in the class. The class was extremely easy, but I felt bad for those who didn't understand things. She speaks horrible English, and she will not clarify answers to any questions. I received a B in her class, because she has a jacked way of grading. Avoid her, she's dumb.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTUwMzAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2280","date_posted":"2010-05-03 22:32:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is NOT easy to understand at all. She acts like she cannot understand English! She grades really easy but makes the assignments so hard it takes at least 3 hours to get through. She is NOT receptive to student's questions.

She has a very thick Korean accent (which you cannot understand. She lectures everyday for the ENTIRE class time. Sits in front of a computer, speaks very low and monotone. If you raise a question, she gives you the death stare. She is very dry, boring, and rude.
