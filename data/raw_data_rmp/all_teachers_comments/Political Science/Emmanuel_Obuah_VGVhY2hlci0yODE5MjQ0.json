He posts all of his lecture powerpoints online so you can review. He has quizzes periodically and only 2 tests. His lectures are a little hard to follow, but his attendance policy is lenient. He passes around a sign in sheet and enters attendance as a grade at the end","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzE3MTE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2401","date_posted":"2022-12-11 04:12:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Was not great at lectures, very soft spoken so unless you sit at the front of the classes you will most likely not be able to hear him. On top of that what he lectures on in class usually has nothing to do with the unit we're learning and its really hard to follow along with. He is also a super tough grader. If you can avoid this class please do","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDcxMDgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2401","date_posted":"2022-12-06 17:31:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class had no structure. Assignments are randomly assigned with no warning. Very unfair grader with no set grading criteria. I am a good writer and an all As student and I struggled to get a B in this class. Lectures are boring and yield no valuable information. Quizzes and tests include the most random questions and are hard to study for.

His quizzes are confusing and have multiple correct answers, does not give clear criteria for grading, tests questions are given on topics hidden deep in the textbook and barely if not ever discussed in the actual lecture. Grades discussion posts like essays with no clear rubric.

He is one of the worst profs I have ever had. Grades extremely harsh on simple discussion posts. On his quizzes, he had questions with multiple clear right answers and has questions about information that isn't discussed in class or on the power points. Do not take this class unless you are prepared to get a C at best.

He does not announce quizzes in class so you have to periodically check d2l;  random essays which he grades roughly; does not accept MLA format;  his tests do not align at all with what is spoken about in class. Quizzes have typos and multiple clearly correct answers. 0/5","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NjcxOTA1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
