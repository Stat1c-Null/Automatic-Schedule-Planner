You would have to try *really* hard to fail. She cancels class a lot, and makes it ridiculously easy to do well. I finished with a 101 and only took 2 of the 4 tests. She gives extra credit (+5 on your TOTAL grade) and open-book quizzes (you can copy DIRECTLY from the book on the quizzes). EASY!

She /does/ shorten study guides for tests.  Test policy allows you to miss one and the next counts double.  Her tests are not the easiest things and count for 80% of the grade.  The study guide is very general and her questions can come from any angle.  She likes discussion and actively encourages it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEwODk5NjMz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2005-11-13 23:46:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Has prefered students that she caters towards.
