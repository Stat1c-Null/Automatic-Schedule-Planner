She never posts grades and her lectures are not engaging whatsoever. She makes us do these news journals as &quot;busy work&quot; that have nothing to do with the material. I would rather spend time doing course work that helped prepare us for the tests.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MzQxNDU5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2017-12-11 21:55:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Kate is amazing, hilarious and highly passionate. She only had a media journal which compares bias in media and had two tests and the final. She gave a 5% participation that everyone gets since she doesn't take attendance. She makes everything easy though. PowerPoint's are online and the review day she tells us what to study. Multiple choice tests!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTQxNDQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Hilarious--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3300","date_posted":"2015-05-06 23:13:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is amazing and very chill about everything. The class consists of writing two case briefs, midterm, final, debate, and participation grade. Loved her. Powerpoints are posted and study them and you will do well on the final and the midterm. She is a defense attorney and she is very patient with everyone. Easy AB course.

You will not know your grade until you see it on your transcript.

The class was very interesting and topics were relevant to  current real-world events. She allowed the students to discuss various topics outloud and debate our opinions. Grades seem to be based on student effort. I would recommend her class to others.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTA5MTMw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3300","date_posted":"2014-04-26 23:46:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a lawyer, very nice, really cool and kinda hot. The class is interesting and I was surprised at how much I learned. The material can be difficult and you need to do a lot of work on your own.

She doesn't post notes online, so class time is spent furiously writing so you don't miss anything, and there is little time to actually understand. Didn't get a graded assignment back all semester despite our first assignment being due Week 1.
