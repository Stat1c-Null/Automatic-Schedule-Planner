He is very lecture-heavy, so if you can not just sit and listen to someone talk, this is not the class for youlots of reading as well.

He would only post lectures with only audio no notes. His quizzes are what makes up your grade. Questions are impossible no amount of AP classes could prepare you for the awfully worded run on questions. He did not tell us this until finals week. He stopped posting a month before..","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjM4NDcx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2019-12-19 07:45:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"He assigns a lot of reading, which is needed to get A's on the weekly quizzes. I took a hybrid, so our quizzes were online every Friday. I didn't take notes or read one time during the whole semester, and I also don't know anything about government, but I still managed to make a high B. The class is easy and he's a cool professor.

He does not tell you when his tests will be on the syllabus, he announces the dates in class. His tests are timed and offered online and you MUST read to pass them. There are only three tests. He is a nice guy and is very smart, but his lectures are dense. However, I would not say he is a difficult professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzE0NzI4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2019-11-14 21:13:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great guy.
