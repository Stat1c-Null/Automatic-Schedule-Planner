He goes through the slide and then posts them on D2L. I skipped the last month of the semester and only came on the day of the final and still received an A in the class, and many students can say the same. He has 2 tests: A midterm and Final Exam. Both aRe multiple choice and True/ False.

He simply explains everything on the powerpoints, which is all the info you will need for the tests. Also, I did not use the textbook at all; it's still in its plastic wrapping.
