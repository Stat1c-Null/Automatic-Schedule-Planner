He posts notes online and posts them on WebCT but our class made him mad so he might stop that. Review sheets is EVERYTHING thats on the test. I only used the book to further understand some things on the review sheet. Very Helpful if you ask for it","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNzA5Njgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3360","date_posted":"2007-01-02 12:47:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Gunning taught US Congress, and it was a fairly easy class, but it is one you need to attend.  Most of his test questions come straight from his lecture.  Class sometimes is long and boring because he doesn't really get the students involved.  But he is very willing to help if you have questions.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNzA4MTc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2280","date_posted":"2006-12-23 14:29:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Research Methods with Pr.Gunning. He is simply the best. He is young and very motivated teacher. It was fun to learn. He tries to find something that might interest him and then bring in to us. He made the most boring course I guess, my favorite class during the semester. He is very very helpful, but it doesn't mean you don't have to study.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNjc0NjEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2006-12-05 12:03:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Oh my gosh!

This class was very fun, very easy. His tests were based on his lectures only. I never opened the book. All that is needed to pass his class with an A is to go to class and take notes; if that is done an A is garanteed. He explains the material very well. He makes the class be very pleasant.

He made his first test the hardest and they got easier. You will have to study unless you are familiar with our government. He is tough somewhat I got a B which I only studied a day or two before the test, took notes in the class, and NEVER read the book!
