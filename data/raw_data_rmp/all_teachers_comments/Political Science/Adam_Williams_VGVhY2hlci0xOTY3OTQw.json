There was a lot of busywork in class and a few times when we were held late, but this was more a time management issue than quality teaching.  Pick an early presentation date, start working on it early, and ask him for help.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MjQwMzc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAD6700","date_posted":"2015-01-15 21:56:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor, Dr. Williams was very clear in his expectations for the class and gave good feedback for how to perform well.  Classes were interesting and enjoyable, he encouraged participation, and the material was not too difficult.  Read the weekly assignments, come to class, work hard on the presentations and 'Quests,' and you'll do well.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Mjk1MjQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3343","date_posted":"2014-12-20 09:44:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Williams hails from FL. He's brought a lot of spunk & enthusiasm to KSU. He has 5 quests (quiztests) where he allows you to use your book & notes. If you listen to his lecture and take notes, you're in the clear. There is one group project where you make updates to a current gov. agency & present it to the class. Start that ASAP.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTUzNzcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
