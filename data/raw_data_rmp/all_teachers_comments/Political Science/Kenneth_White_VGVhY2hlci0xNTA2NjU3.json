His class is not easy, but it is a 4000 level class. He works hard to stress the importance of taking responsibility. He is very clear about his expectations, and does not waiver from them. If you want a true learning experience, take this class from him. If you want an easy A, don't.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjA1NzI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS4490","date_posted":"2011-05-13 11:49:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Although I got one of the lowest grades of my college career (a C!) i still REALLY liked this prof! I wouldn't recommend taking his class as an elective as I did if it's not your major, but he's VERY straight forward about what he expects! Gotta respect that.
