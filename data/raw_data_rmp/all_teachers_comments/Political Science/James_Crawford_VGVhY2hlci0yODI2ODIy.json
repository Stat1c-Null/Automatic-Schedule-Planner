The workload is kind of insane, you have to read an entire chapter with either an essay or discussion post every single week and a quiz every other week. Also, you aren't allowed to reply to peers on the same day that you post your initial post or you get points taken off.

Every other week there are writing assignments, that are 2 to 3 pages. He's a bit of a harsh grader and will take points off for trivial things. He also tends to personally email you on the day something is due if you haven't turned it in yet, which I found strange.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzkyNjkw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3300","date_posted":"2023-01-12 21:11:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not a hard class very easy to pass.

He is extremely rude and if you ask him a question prepare to get no help. The class itself sucks. He gives you until friday to post but if you post friday you wont get full point.

There is a lot of reading ( ~700 pages worth), quizzes are 5 questions (easy as long as you read), and most importantly, enough extra credit to bump you up a whole letter grade. Dr. Crawford is very responsive and open to feedback. So far, the class has been very decent.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzAxOTM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS3300","date_posted":"2022-10-01 02:28:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Read 100 pages a week, have a quiz with just 5 questions, miss 2, get 60, repeat. Answers to quiz questions can be wrong. Fight him on his answers! Turn discussions in the day they open, not when they're due, or he won't give you full credit, seriously. He doesn't know how to communicate. This class uniquely frustrated me.
