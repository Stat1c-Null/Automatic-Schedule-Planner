The lectures are interesting and easy to follow. The tests are open book. If you can't pass them then you have a problem. The study guides are helpful and you can use them on the tests. It is impossible to fail the tests! He provides you with everything to perform well in the class. It's just up to you to use it!

He will call you out on it and he drops your grade two points each time you miss.
