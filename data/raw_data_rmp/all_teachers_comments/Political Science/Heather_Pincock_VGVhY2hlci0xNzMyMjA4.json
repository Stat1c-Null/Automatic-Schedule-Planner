She's super caring about her students and is willing to help you when you're struggling. Her pop-quizzes are easy, but you have to do a lot of reading. Her tests are easy as well, but please show up to get a good grade on them. Excited for the final project, which btw is a huge chunk of the grade.

Not to mention her tests being ridiculously long (they were originally 100 questions and now 75), and extremely nitpicky questions. You have to search through the book to find the answers.

She gave out a weekly assignment every week but they were typically long and time-consuming. (I thought so because I had other classes and a part-time job).
