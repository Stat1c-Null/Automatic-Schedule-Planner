Really loves what she teaches. Her tests are a little tough, but if you study the quizzes and your notes you should make an A. She hates when people don't come to class, and if you do she will make it worth your while.

There were only 15 questions on each test. To study read the book, highlight the important points and then study what you DID NOT highlight. She went back and gave credit for three bad questions, she should have thrown out a few more that were ambiguous. She was fair about that.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNDA0ODc0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS4410","date_posted":"2007-07-29 13:20:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this as an online class summer semester. The class itself was not too difficult and I found the material very interesting. Class consists of 4 tests and 3 papers. I thought she graded the papers harshly, and then on the last paper I got a 100. I felt like all my papers were pretty much the same quality wise, but I guess not.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMzYyNTIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS4410","date_posted":"2007-07-25 19:05:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed this class, and \r I thought Dr.Neubauer was a great instructor.
