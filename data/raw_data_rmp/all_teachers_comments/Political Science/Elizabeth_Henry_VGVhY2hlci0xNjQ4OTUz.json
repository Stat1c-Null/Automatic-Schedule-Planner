Played one documentary per section which added a lot of interest to material. Made it very obvious what information would be on exam.

Come to class to get the answers for tests. 4 tests, gives you the terms and could just use straight memorization. Tests are easy, just write 3 bullet points. Offers help & lots of office hours. Very simple class. Always happy & cheery. Never taken US history before & I thoroughly enjoyed her class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjAxNzc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2112","date_posted":"2012-04-26 21:53:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lecture style teacher with little connectivity.  Just spit out information.  Nothing to verify that she's getting through.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTMyOTY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
