This class was a lot, on top of managing other classes. He's not a bad professor, just wouldn't take again or recommend due to the workload.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzkyMDQw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PERS2700","date_posted":"2023-03-29 01:54:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great guy that really cares for his students. Took him in my first semester of freshman year and the class was fairly easy. No quizzes or tests just A lot of writing assignments but if you give some effort, you'll be fine. The group projects are not very difficult, and he takes attendance however I missed many days and still got an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTUyODgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PERS2700","date_posted":"2023-01-24 17:40:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"The professor was decent, the actual class content is hard part. The only issue I had was he would forget to remind us about assignments due on D2L so I missed 6 assignments in total because I didn't know they existed.  Though he did allow students to make up late work.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzcyODk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PERS2700","date_posted":"2022-04-30 19:15:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class isn't very difficult. He does lecture a lot though but no quizzes. There are weekly discussion/reflection papers due, but the reflections only have to be a page long. He isn't a tough grader either. Make effort on the writing assignments and you'll get a good grade. There are 3 projects in this class but 2 of them are group projects.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjAxNTcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PERS2700","date_posted":"2022-04-20 00:00:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"10-page paper if you take his half a semester class.
