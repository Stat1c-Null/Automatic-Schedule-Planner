The tests are long, but if you go to 10 of the optional zoom sessions you don't have to take the final. HI wish I actually knew what his lectures were like. Gave a 3 because he wasn't bad, but I didn't really interact with him a whole bunch.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTA1NTcx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2021-07-01 15:03:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly just show up and participate and hell give you a good grade","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTQ3OTgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2012-11-18 22:26:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a great dude, but not a great teacher.

I took him online and easily made an A in the class. As long as you read the book, do the discussions, and actually put forth some effort, you will pass and probably make an A. He is very helpful and his grading policty & expectations are clear. Take him if you can, you'll learn a lot!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTc2Nzg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS07","date_posted":"2012-04-12 10:03:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good go either way if you read your chapters and listen to him in class the class isn't that hard. If you don't do both though might struggle a bit, but can be helped with the study guide he gives before a test.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDM3MDM5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS1101","date_posted":"2010-12-05 17:03:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hated this class. I have gotten an A in every gov. class ive ever taken. not this one. He does not answer your questions correctly. He does not know how to formulate a sentence correctly.

So far, SO EASY. Everything you need to know on a test is on a powerpoint (which he posts online) or in the text. He also gives study guides which are exactly what you need to study.

Durham grades subjectively and in a biased manner. He does not tell you what is expected of you and can give you no explanation for your grage. He is very slow at returning grades and posting assignments.It's Political Science yet he makes it seem like rocket science.
