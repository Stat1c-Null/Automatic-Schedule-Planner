While the material was, and probably never will be, that interesting or exciting to learn, it was important, and Professor Fletcher did a great job in teaching it. While there is definitely a solid amount of work that needs to be done, it's nothing crazy. Best online course I've taken, and it's not even close.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjQ5NTUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2280","date_posted":"2012-11-14 15:09:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Kim is super nice. She goes to great lengths to make sure that you understand the material. Very fair but still challenging. Would take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODM0NDE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
