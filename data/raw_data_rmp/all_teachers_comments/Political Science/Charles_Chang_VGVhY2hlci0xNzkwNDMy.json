You will learn a lot, you will have to work, and you will be capable of making a good grade so long as you CARE! And that's all. If you have the OPPORTUNITY to be in his class, you should. Interesting person, has many great stories too about his time in the force. &easyontheeyes","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDg1ODAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2250","date_posted":"2014-01-07 23:54:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"His heavy korean accent makes it even harder to follow or understand; class is really boring, reads off the power point word for word like they do in the army.

You can take the quizzes as many times as you want and there was only a midterm, final, and a paper besides the quizzes. Easiest professor I have ever taken.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTg3MzE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
