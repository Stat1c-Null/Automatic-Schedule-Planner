She will say that something will be on a quiz and then it won't be so it is difficult to even know what to study. Quizzes can be 5-10 questions and cover a ton of material, this increases the difficulty.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5Mjc0Mjc4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2280","date_posted":"2011-11-07 17:48:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"BEWARE!Her qiuzzes are like tests. All questions are short answer.

That alone should let you know how terrible her class will be.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTc5NjQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2280","date_posted":"2011-09-26 17:34:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Warning, her class is tough, she teaches it as a graduate class. You have 5 quizes a paper and a final, and each quiz is a letter grade.  The quizes are short answer to essay, and are extremely hard, she doesn't believe in m/c.  The quizes will make or break your grade, my only suggestion is to find another teacher, half of my class has dropped!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MDI0MzU4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
