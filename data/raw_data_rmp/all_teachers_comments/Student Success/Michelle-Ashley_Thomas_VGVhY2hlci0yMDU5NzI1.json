She makes it almost impossible to make anything lower than an A. As long as you read the chapters and do all the assignments to the best of your ability she will give you an A. She is very personable and really likes it if you have a southern accent(:","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NDYyNzE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
