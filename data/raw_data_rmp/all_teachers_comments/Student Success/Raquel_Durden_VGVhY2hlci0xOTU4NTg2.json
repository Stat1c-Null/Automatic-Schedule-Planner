Class is mandatory and there is a lot of busy work at first but it slows down as the semester goes on. The work can seem annoying but she never assigns more than you can handle and she wants to help you if you need it. Attendance is necessary if you want to pass. She's reasonable and fair.

She is very clear about what she expects from you and she presents the material in a straightforward manner. There are a few projects/papers including a group presentation, however, she gives you plenty of time to complete the assignments. The quizzes are online and open book as well.

The semester will seem a little tough at the beginning but it's completely worth it and she teaches you SO many important life lessons. It's for sure not an easy A, but the projects are always fun. She gives AMAZING feedback and will be there to listen to you and help.

There are no tests, the quizzes for each section you take online, and the final is in class but she gives you the questions beforehand. Projects will take up most of your grade.
