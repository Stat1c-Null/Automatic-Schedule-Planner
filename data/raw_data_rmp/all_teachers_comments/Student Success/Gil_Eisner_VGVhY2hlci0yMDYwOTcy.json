The class was very boring in my opinion but, Professor Eisner made it bearable. There were 5 online quizzes, 2 essays, 1 big group project and a few individual projects. The class is extremely easy to pass and you don't get a lot of work.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njk4MzQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-12-11 09:51:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Eisner is probably one of the coolest professors/teachers I have ever had! He is a very laid back and fun type of person. He is very lenient and understanding about grades  and assignments. He usually will extend deadlines when after they are due to give you another opportunity to succeed, without penalty! TAKE HIM IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDI5ODM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"Respected--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-12-11 01:54:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am so glad I decided to take him for freshman seminar!! He is such a great professor and genuinely cares about his students. The assignments he gives are super clear and easy to do. He understands the class is supposed to be a GPA booster, but also makes it so we learn something. Definitely take him!

Attendance is mandatory but he often lets class out early so you can go home and work on individual assignments. His lectures are power point based so taking notes is super easy. Although this class is easy, don't slack off. He's all around a great teacher! And no 10 page essays either","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzczNTE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-12-04 18:13:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really cares about students and their grades. Easy Seminar class compared to may of the other professors. Just have 5 online quizzes, 2 tests, and a few projects. Lectures are boring but he tries to make them more fun.

You have to have the book for an access code to take your quizzes. Multiple projects and quizzes but only a Midterm and Final. After a certain amount of absences you drop a letter grade. Long powerpoint lectures that are usually common sense and boring. He was nice but I did not enjoy the class.
