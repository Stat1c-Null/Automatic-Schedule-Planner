As someone who deals with a lot of mental health issues, she tends to use hers as a crutch and makes weird jokes about it all the time. Also goes off topic a lot. On the last day of class she gave out male contraceptives with animal facts on them. Very incredibly weird.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODYzNDk1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-12-06 13:32:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Pede is great.
