There are readings, weekly quizzes, discussions, and some other assignments for the final project. It was a lot, but just manage your time and you'll be fine. Dr. Polk was very nice and gave you help if you needed it! Gives you good feedback on discussions and projects.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDQ2NzQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Accessible outside class--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
