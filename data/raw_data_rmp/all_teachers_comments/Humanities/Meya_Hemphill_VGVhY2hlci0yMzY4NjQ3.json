She is very caring and considerate towards her students and understands that we have lives outside of the classroom. There was a good bit of writing but the topics are very interesting and thought-provoking. I would definitely take her again for other subjects!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjUzNjE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"AADS1102","date_posted":"2018-05-01 22:15:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class wasn't the best but it wasn't the absolute worst either. There are weekly quizzes (really easy &amp; 5 questions each), two tests online, a film review assignment (3-4 pages), weekly discussion board posts, and a group project. Every assignment in this class was easy and I made A's on almost everything in this class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTUzNTQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

This class was straightforward with all of the information posted on D2L. This class did not require any books as well. She graded everything on time and was always available to speak about issues or questions about the weekly topic.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTM0MjA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
