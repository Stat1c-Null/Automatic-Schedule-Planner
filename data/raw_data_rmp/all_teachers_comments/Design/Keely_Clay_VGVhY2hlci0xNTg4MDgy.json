Her classes are easy if you care and pay attention. She's not big on lecturing. Everyone participates in class discussions about the industry. She is accessible outside of class.

She really cares for her student and tries to make the work as simple as possible for the student. Honestly, if you don't succeed in any of her courses then it is probably 99.8%  your fault and not hers, because she makes courses too easy for you to understand.
