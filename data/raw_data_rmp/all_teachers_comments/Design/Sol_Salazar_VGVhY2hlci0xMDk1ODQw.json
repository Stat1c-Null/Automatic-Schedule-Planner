She explained very clearly what she asked of us. Once she realized that unless she explained all of what she wanted, we'd ask millions of questions. She's not hard to understand once she gets talking. If you ask her what she wants she'll tell you. She likes playing your models f.y.i. so make sure they can played with.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzA2MDkx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN2241","date_posted":"2009-07-19 01:45:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"First of all you don't have to be Spanish to do well in here class!! I'm 0% Spanish and made a 99 in her class. She's the sweetest women in the world and if you ever take her class you'll defiantly love her. She's very hard to understand at first because of her soft voice. She expects late work if you work hard in class. Do take her for D.com!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDQ5MTY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1002","date_posted":"2008-08-11 19:51:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"No Comments","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NzMzOTgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1001","date_posted":"2008-04-09 21:09:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Definitly take if you're spanish, you'll pass for sure.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MjY4MDU1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DFN1001","date_posted":"2008-01-21 17:29:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"awesome teacher! hard to understand at first but you'll learn to understand her. i'd recommend her to any first years. as long as you try, you should receive a B or higher, but trying involves many many MANY all nighters. so be prepared!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MDI2NjUw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
