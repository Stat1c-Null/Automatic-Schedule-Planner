His tests are hard as are the lab assignments. Pay attention in class and study, study, study.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTM1OTcz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEO1113","date_posted":"2014-01-09 05:07:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not only is Professor Vann a great teacher, he is also a great person. He shows a lot of interest in what he teaches. He is the most helpful teacher I've ever had in my 4 years as a student. If you are on a track to complete your Geography or GIS major, I strongly recommend taking Dr. Vann. You will regret it if you take someone else.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzI0MDU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1112","date_posted":"2013-11-13 12:38:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"I liked him.
