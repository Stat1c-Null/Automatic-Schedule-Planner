Really nice teacher (don't sleep though), pretty funny, attendance was only taken 3 times but only for extra credit on tests; take good notes, tests come STRAIGHT from notes. He gives study guides that are really long but I made sure to know everything on there & never made less than a 102 on a test. Put the work in & you'll get an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTk2ODE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1101","date_posted":"2009-12-07 13:40:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shelley is an old-school professor, no class participation or discussion, just straight lecturing.
