Every week, you have a lecture, a quiz (with two attempts), and a discussion post or assignment. The lectures and topics are very interesting. A few of the lectures were a bit long, but it was mostly due to some videos you have to watch. She also grades very fairly and overall it was an amazing class!

Every week there were 2 assignments due a quiz, a discussion post, or a writing assignment. They were easy and didn't take that long, you also get 2 attempts on the quiz. The professor isn't a strict grader so should get 100s if you just put in some effort. She also responds to emails.

Just don't. I know my grade says otherwise, but I dreaded this class. Her way of grading makes 0 sense, she doesn't answer emails, when she makes a mistake she doesn't apologize, the labs were so difficult, overall it just wasn't it. The connect was easy though..(Quizlet) She almost turned in an F as a final grade when it was an A.

One quiz and one assignment for each unit, the assignment varied from discussion boards, watching documentaries, researching, or writing mini-essays. There was a final as well. Everything you need is in the story maps, if you read them the class is an easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTMyNDM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1112","date_posted":"2022-11-15 02:14:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was overwhelming at first, but once you get into a groove, it's not bad! Typically you'll have an assignment, assessment, storymap lab, and news articles to post. The labs were confusing at first, but not hard. She allows 3 attempts when submitting! No lectures.

Connect wouldnt be bad if each assignment didnt take LITERAL hours to complete. Worst part is the labs. Theyre insanely difficult as well as the actual 'learning' material from them is never ON THE TEST PORTION. \nOverly difficult.

She is awful at teaching and you will teach yourself EVERYTHING and I had to withdraw. A lot of your work is on connect and it is easy but she makes you do these story-map labs which are IMPOSSIBLE, and they weigh the majority of your grade. She doesn't give clear instructions and grades hard. Half of my class had to drop.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NjcwMDU2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1112","date_posted":"2021-11-08 18:03:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"She doesn't teach, like at all. It is all work in the textbook and labs that she doesn't make. All of it is automatically graded online. Only spoken to her once and she seemed kind and was helpful, but otherwise, I don't feel like she's even really my professor.
