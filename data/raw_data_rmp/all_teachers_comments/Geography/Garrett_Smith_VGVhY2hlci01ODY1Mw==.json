ALWAYS wears black jeans... we had an ongoing joke about him, and he would never answer questions. If you asked one he would tell you to get back to him.  If you're teaching a class you should have the answer, or know enough about it to BS an answer.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMzgwMzA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1101","date_posted":"2006-01-17 18:20:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"What a great teacher.

He knows a lot and communicates well. Economic Geography is a complicated subject and he explains it well. He is very eager to help and answers all your questions. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT MISSING CLASS! You will miss out on important test material. 2 Exams, 1 paper & presentation, and a couple of map exercises.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExMzM0MDM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2005-08-11 08:03:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor! Brings his own travels and experiences into class which makes it interesting and fun. Tests are mostly from lecture, occasionally he'll throw in something from book. Atlas questions are open book but it doesn't hurt to know where places are. Gives essay questions in advance which is good.

The tests come mostly from class lectures.  There is an essay question but he gives it to you a week before the test.  He has been to a lot of different places so he is very knowledgeable.

That means that if he says something twice or writes it on the board it is on a test.  No papers and projects are pier graded.
