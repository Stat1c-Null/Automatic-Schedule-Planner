He spends a large portion of the class period talking about people he knows in the industry, instead of clarifying concepts. There are no rubrics available for the assignments; grading is fairly subjective.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTIxNjcx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
