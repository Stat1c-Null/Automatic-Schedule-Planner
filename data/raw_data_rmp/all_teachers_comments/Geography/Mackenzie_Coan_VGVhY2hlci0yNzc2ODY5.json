There is basically no interaction with her, the only thing she actually grades (not automatic) are the two discussions and the final, there are no lecture videos or helpful interaction on her part, the course may as well be run by a TA.

Weekly textbook reading, quizzes, and discussion. There is no final but instead there is a final project that was fairly easy. She is very very strict with deadlines and will not provide extensions so make sure you stay on top of things. Regardless, it was pretty easy to adhere to those deadlines so just don't procrastinate.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTc4NzQz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEO1130","date_posted":"2023-12-09 00:36:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"For the fall semester of 2023, I have to say that this is the best and great teacher that I have had. Even if I did take her class online, it's very important to keep up with the due dates because you wouldn't want to receive a bad grade, right? Overall, the teacher is very understanding and makes sure to turn your assignments in on time.

Her discussions aren't very clear, and the writing standard is set low. Easy to complete for quick grade from a student's perspective - but will give you a low grade for responding vaguely, when the original post is 2-3 sentences long. Grading wasn't realistic or flexible.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTY4NTEz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEO1130","date_posted":"2023-12-03 06:05:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class itself is easy, but this professor makes it very easy to fail the class.
