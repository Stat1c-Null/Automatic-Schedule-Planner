Gives so much busy work, which I am assuming is to \"make up\" for class time since it was an online course. Still, I typically devoted an entire day to complete all or most of the work (around 10 hours total). Way too much for a core class that doesn't matter in the long run.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODMzNTQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Test heavy--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1112k","date_posted":"2024-11-14 19:08:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"two-week module schedule, one for reading the chapter and taking an assignment and then assessment, then the 2nd week for the lab and discussion. the chapters are long, devote like 3-7 hours a week to read, it's necessary to get good grades. went through an entire notebook of notes lol. enjoyed the content much more than I thought I would tho.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTUwMzcz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1125","date_posted":"2024-10-23 20:56:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Definitely take a course with Dr. Hall, she made the class very clear and the workload was very manageable.

She doesn't reopen assignments past deadlines but as long as you manage your time well you're going to be fine.

Not only is the course itself kinda tough, she makes it even harder by adding unnecessary discussion posts that have unclear due dates.
