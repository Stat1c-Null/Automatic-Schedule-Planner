There were so many issues in the beginning we ended up starting late. She lives in another state so she isn't on campus to work things out with you. The learnsmart takes hours to read and the quizzes are nit-picky. Can't work ahead and on weeks when there isn't a learnsmart, there's a lab.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzk0Mjgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GEOG1113","date_posted":"2018-09-24 12:10:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Although there were technical difficulties that were beyond the professor's control, I found it very difficult to communicate with the professor.
