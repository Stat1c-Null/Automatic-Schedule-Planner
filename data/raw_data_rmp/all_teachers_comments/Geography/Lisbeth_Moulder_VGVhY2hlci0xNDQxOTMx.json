Her lectures are interesting because she makes sure to add personal experiences to them. I passed all the tests and she even hands out study guides for them beforehand so you know whats coming!

The slideshows are very long. She mispronounces many things and  gives inaccurate information. She has a sign in sheet for attendance and it's part of the grade.

Professor Moulder isn't exceptional, but she makes everything easy. Attendance is required, maps are required to be turned in about once a month. Not too much homework, easy tests. Two long papers that comprise 15% of your grade each. Boring lectures, but she always makes an effort to let out early.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQyOTI5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOGRAPHY1101","date_posted":"2015-01-28 10:56:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"She assigns lots of reading, but I honestly never even opened the book. As long as you show up for class, do the assigned map homework (takes 10 minutes) every week, review the presentations before the test, and even try a little on the two main essays you'll be golden.
