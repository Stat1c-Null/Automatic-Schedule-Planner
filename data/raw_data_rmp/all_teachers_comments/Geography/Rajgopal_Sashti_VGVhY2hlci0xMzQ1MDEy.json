Tests/quizzes were easy, and though he has an accent his lectures weren't difficult to understand. If you take notes and skim through textbook his class is simple.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzY3Mjc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEO1101","date_posted":"2011-02-07 07:52:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO  NOT TAKE AT ALL COST! you have to do a TEN page outline for EVERY single chapter, he writes on the board and it is not legible at all!

Do not take! His lectures had no clear or concise path. Homework was pointless and did not help you to understand the material. The test material did not jive well with the chapters assigned. The grading scale was not defined in the syllabus. Stay away!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDY5MjQy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
