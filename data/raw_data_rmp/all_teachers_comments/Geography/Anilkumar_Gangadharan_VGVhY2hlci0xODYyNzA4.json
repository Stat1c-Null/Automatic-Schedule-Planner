First, his lectures are dry, but he tries to spice things up sometimes. Second, he can be rather emotionally volatile/intimidating at times. And, lastly, he has a certain foreign accent that makes him a tad hard to understand at times. Beyond all of that he is... okay, I guess.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTcxMTI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

He is very easy and all of the work is online. Grade consists of easy labs and three exams. He responds fast via email and is very flexible. I ended up with a 97.9% in the class.
