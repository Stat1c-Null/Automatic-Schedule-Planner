Very structured with his work and sends out at least 3 emails a week keeping people up to date on what they should be working on that week. If you do the work you will pass easily!

I had a 4-week class so every week I had two labs and two quizzes. The labs are interactive and easy and the quizzes were not very hard. He had great powerpoints which were very helpful.
