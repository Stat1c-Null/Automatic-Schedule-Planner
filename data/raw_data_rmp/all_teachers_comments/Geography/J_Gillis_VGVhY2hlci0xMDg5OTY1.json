Just as a suggestion, always read the section before going to class because not everything on the quizzes is from the atlas. Go to class because he gives bonus points for it at the end of the semester. It was not very difficult, just a hard class to sit through.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODkwNjkx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1101","date_posted":"2010-10-05 23:42:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"This man is awful.He seriously does not know how to teach. He retired then went back into teaching because he was bored. All he talks about is his families experiences. He always has an effing story to tell about each country its ridiculous. He is not clear on some of the things he says. He has open atlas quizes randomly so always have your atlas.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjM0NDE1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1101","date_posted":"2010-05-07 16:05:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gillis is a good teacher and has funny, interesting stories. He is very clear on everything he wants from you and is a very fair grader. You are allowed to use your atlas for every grade in the class, which is EXTREMELY helpful. The in class quizzes are pretty easy and if they are hard he will give out hints. The tests arent bad either.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTQ3NTAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1101","date_posted":"2010-05-05 19:36:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gillis spends the whole semester talking about his personal trips and NO time on what is on the test..He grades the papers according to his opinion.. Going to class ends up being extra credit (which you will need after the semester of failing all his bogus tests)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTMwODQ0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1101","date_posted":"2008-11-07 08:48:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"I enjoyed this class.  It was hard at first because you don't really know what the tests are going to be like...and the first on was hard!  But, then you kinda get in a groove and the class really becomes enjoyable.  It's all lecture and can be a little long sometimes, but all in all I would recommend him!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTUzOTg0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
