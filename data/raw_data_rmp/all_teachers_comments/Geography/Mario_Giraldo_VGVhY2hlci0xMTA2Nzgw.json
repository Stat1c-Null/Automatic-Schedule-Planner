I think Professor Giraldo was probably the best teacher I ever had. He was extremely helpful and knowledgable about what he wanted from us. I took this as a maymester class, so he made it as interesting a he possibly could.If you pay attention and study the maps and key terms he gives you...you are good to go! :)","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjI4NTg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG2010","date_posted":"2010-05-06 15:10:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"what did he just say.....&#63;  other than that,  he was pretty cool.  pretty easy class as long as you go over the material before the tests and pay attention in the lectures.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTM3ODc4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG4410","date_posted":"2009-11-02 11:00:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"I've had him for 3 classes and one more to go next semester. By far not my favorite teacher. I have yet to figure out how he got his PhD and still can't pronounce words. Tests are hard, basically straight from the powerpoints. I haven't read A book in his classes. He also doesn't explain things well.. I was on facebook the majority of the class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mjk5MTY5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1101","date_posted":"2009-05-22 19:05:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"He mas no hay bean speaking inglich por manny jeers.There are several map quizzes, and a couple of exams(I took him for May Mester though).I sailed through the class, but a lot of people were struggling.Questions on the exams were at times tricky or random, more like a higher level class,not intro. Probably won't take him again.

I took the basic geography class as a may-mester but I wish now I could have taken him for a full semester. He was very interesting and knew how to change things up a lot so I never got bored.

Even if you go to his office for help, he has to explain it 4 or 5 times to make it somewhat comprehensible.   He has his PhD in the subject but can't talk about it and is frequently stumped by questions.  All said below and at UGA is 100% true. All who passed had to teach themselves or have other profs to  teach them.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0Mzg2Mzg2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG4410","date_posted":"2008-04-23 20:54:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst teacher I have ever had!!

You will learn nothing.  He tells you material won't be on the test so don't study it and then tests you on it.  This is his MO, see his UGA ratings.  He is a nice guy until you ask questions in class then he gets mad. Students didn't ask him questions because of that and because they were so lost they couldn't.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MTI5NzM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
