Her tests were rediculous.  Not only do you have to know the 3 chapters for the test, but you have to know every country, river, landform, etc. and be able to identify it on a map.

Nice teacher, but her class is easy to stay awake in @ 8 in the morning. Sometimes the info is interesting. She does powerpoints the whole course, which she posts on WebCT.
