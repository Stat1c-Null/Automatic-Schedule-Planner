The material isn't very interesting, but he cracks occasional jokes. The tests are straight from the study guide, but it is a LOT of information. Just make sure you study a lot for the tests and you will be fine. Easy B, very obtainable A. 2 assignments which are very easy and you never have to go to class.

Note outlines posted online before class, extremely helpful for note taking. If you fill in around them you will ace the tests. 4 tests, no midterm or final, choose 2 of 3 easy assignments.
