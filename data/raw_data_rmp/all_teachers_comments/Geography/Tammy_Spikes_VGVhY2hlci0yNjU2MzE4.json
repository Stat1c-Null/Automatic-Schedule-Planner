There is a lot of rather tedious homework, so beware of that at least. Weekly reading and long assessment based on the reading (open book/note), lecture videos, labs, and occasional discussions and tests. Try your best to stay on top of things n youll be fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTc5MzEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GEOG1112","date_posted":"2024-11-06 17:23:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"SUPER EASY!
