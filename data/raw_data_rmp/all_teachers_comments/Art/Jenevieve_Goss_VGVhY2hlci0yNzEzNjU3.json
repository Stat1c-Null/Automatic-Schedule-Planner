You cannot go wrong with taking her. She is very creative and balances out lectures and videos to help you understand better. She makes a class which itself rather stale a reason to get up and go to class in the morning. She is very helpful to her students and honestly no one should fail her class. 10/10!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDg0OTE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2021-11-30 20:32:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a really good professor.
