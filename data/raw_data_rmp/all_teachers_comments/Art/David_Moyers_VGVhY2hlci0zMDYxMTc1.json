Sometimes he says things that may come off as mean but I truly think he doesn't mean it that way and is just joking around. Gives very good feedback and loves to give/receive recommendations on things.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTE4ODQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART4024","date_posted":"2024-12-14 03:11:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really appreciated having Professor Moyers for Motion Graphics; he always wanted to help and worked with students to turn in work as soon as they possibly could. Please make sure to communicate with him if you're having any problems as he just wants to help. His class is actually incredibly easy and his tutorial structure while long is helpful.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjg5MjUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
