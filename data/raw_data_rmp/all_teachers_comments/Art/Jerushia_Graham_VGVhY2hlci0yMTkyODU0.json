The two most important factors of her class were her constant lectures and small, weekly art assignments. The directions of such were vague and the purpose was truly pointless. The worst part was the attendance policy. Missed 3 days due to illness and could not make an A. Do not take.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjIzODMx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART1100","date_posted":"2016-12-13 23:41:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Was her 1st semester teaching so def some kinks to iron out. My biggest gripe is she puts u in groups and thn changes them every month. Assignmts are easy but doesn't give much time to complete. Mon assigmnts due b4 class on wed. Then discussion post & other assignment due sun. Pointless group presentation. Not hard. Just a lot for an art class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDgxMjgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"GROUP PROJECTS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2016-11-16 10:08:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her for a generic art class. She does not grade anything in a timely manner. In the last few weeks of the semester, I still didn't have any grades in the class. She is really strict about attendance when the class shouldn't even require attendance. Her assignments are vague and she does not always open a folder for you to submit it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTk4ODQy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
