She really seemed to understand that students must be going through a lot curing COVID, and made adjustments accordingly. Everything was open notes, we had one paper, easy classwork. This class was nice and laid back- a nice breather from the rest of my classes. Definitely take this class with Trina.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTg1MjIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2020-11-29 01:43:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"if you want credit for doing absolutely nothing except on test days, this is the most amazing class to take. had her for art in society-- would 100% recommend if you are a slacker or are just awful with time management. she is sweet and just doing her best to make covid easy for everyone, love her to bits. take this teacher.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTAwMTUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2020-08-09 23:11:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is extremely easy to do well in. 5% of the grade comes from turning in a consent form.

She did take attendance but she just lectures all class. You have three tests that are all 30 questions and she basically gives you the test on the study guides.
