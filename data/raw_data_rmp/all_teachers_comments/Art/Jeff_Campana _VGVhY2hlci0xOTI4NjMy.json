Knows a lot of people in the ceramic community. Apparently invented a bunch of ceramics techniques.

Encourages students no matter what the skill level. Critiques based on effort and care for your skill level. Very chill and flexible. He understands how stressful a class of this nature is and constantly works with students so they can produce their best work.

He is kind, knowledgeable, and experienced. He gives out challenging but fun assignments. He really gets you to think critically. Although 3D and sculpture are not my major, I would like to take another class with him. This is probably the first time I had a fun time with a group project.
