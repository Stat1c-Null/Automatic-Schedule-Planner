She is very flexible with students and understanding of other classes course loads. It was the first semester of the improved Production 2 course, and Sandee handled it very well and it was a great start to learning rigging! Plenty of room for learning more if you're interested as well!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjY5ODkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3600","date_posted":"2022-05-07 15:57:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Chamberlain is amazing. She was always accessible outside of class and she was always willing to help if we needed it. Only 5 big assignments in the class so we can focus on them rather than trying to take quizzes/tests too. If we needed extra time for a project, she gave it to us. Great professor and I highly recommend her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjcyODg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3650","date_posted":"2019-04-05 03:46:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"She missed class on the last day before spring break to see a ball game with her father without notifying students that she would be absent beforehand.

Understands that students are adults with responsibilities and interests outside of the classroom, but expects great work because of the freedom she allows. Great for upper level classes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTMzNDcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
