We had a few students who were always skipping half of the class because he never gave clear expectations and seemed forgetful. He knows his stuff, he just couldn't seem to get it across very well.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDM3OTQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART3150","date_posted":"2018-12-14 23:31:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Weiss is a highly experienced artist and an overall great professor.

He doesn't give clear assignments, objectives, or grading criteria. It took him a month to get us the syllabus. He's awkward to talk to, and didn't care about what I did because I was a painting major, not an illustrator. Waste of time and money. And I'm a straight-A art student.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzk1MTY0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART11077","date_posted":"2018-05-10 00:26:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gary Weiss is a very down to earth and awesome teacher. He is insanely experienced and I absolutely loved his class. I highly recommend him as you will learn a lot! He is very caring about his students but he is serious about attendance, don't miss more than 4 days! He's pretty okay if you're a little late. Definitely take him you won't regret it!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDUwMTA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?
