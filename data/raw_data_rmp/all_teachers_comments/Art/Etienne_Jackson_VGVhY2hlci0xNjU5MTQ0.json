Takes WEEKS to return test grades. Never responds to emails. Tests are very difficult and can include massive amounts of information he expects you to memorize. Does not understand that Art 1107 is for non art majors. Stay away.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5Mzg5NzM3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
