Gives A's but is super nit-picky & wishy-washy about what she likes. Ex: Tells you to add color during rough print, takes points off on the final product because of too much color. She only likes what she likes, so you're basically a graphic design workshop for her. Didn't learn much except for how to use InDesign and typefaces.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTIyMDY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2550","date_posted":"2015-01-23 16:12:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Hwang care genuinely about her students and really wants to see us succeed.

She's a nice person but a terrible professor.

Because of her accent, it sometimes becomes a little diffuclt to hear and keep up with her lectures.
