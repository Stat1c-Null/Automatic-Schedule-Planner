Expect the grading rubrics to be extremely wordy to the point a lot of the class makes mistakes, and the teacher will penalize said students instead of looking how their rubrics are organized.

He did not provide our class with a clear rubric for assignments/projects. He was unfiltered and relentless in his feedback about students' work, so you have to be mentally tough to succeed. He will push you to improve as an artist, but you often have to teach yourself.

He encourages returning in assignments to see improvement.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTk1NTE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

He really focuses on each student individually and gets to know you as an artist.
