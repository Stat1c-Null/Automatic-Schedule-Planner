There was one assignment each week that had to be under a page in length. They did not take very long and I considered them to be fun and interesting. You got to watch a short video or interview and simply write a little bit about it or answer a few questions. Very easy seven week course","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDYyMTcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ATT1000","date_posted":"2020-10-28 18:06:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"The orientation class has more homework than her history of fashion class! video lectures (done by someone else, most of them not even working) and written assignments weekly, along with 2 major projects. all for a ONE CREDIT class?? makes no sense.

Her lectures are monotonous, she literally just reads straight from the book. The only assignments are a few quick homework and a few tests, all stolen from quizlets. It's very clear she does not care about what she teaches nor giving a good experience to the students.

And she did not even try to hide it, she read from her notes, and followed the textbook to a &quot;T&quot;. Even then she did not explain things well, the simplest topic sounded extremely complicated and confusing. However, not much work to do, just make sure to study.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzE2ODI0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
