He gives really good feedback, projects are fun, and you can tell he genuinely cares about his students. He constantly checks in on each student, making sure they aren't having trouble on projects. Lectures can be long, but you can work while he talks.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTg2MTc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3620","date_posted":"2025-05-06 04:17:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Santiago is one of my favorites on campus. I took him both this semester and last semester, and both were wonderful experiences. His critiques are thorough and well balanced- you will know what you did well and what to improve. He's very lenient, and as long as you communicate with him, he will be understanding if you're behind.

I highly suggest if anything comes up for you during the semester to communicate clearly with him as he can only help you if you communicate.

He will sit and help individual students as needed. If you are not feeling well he'll tell you to go home, no worries. Critiques are long and detailed so be ready for 1-2 class-long critiques, but they are no stress.

He's a great person and really cares for every student. 5 projects total; 3 are prompt (1 group project) and 2 are self-lead (use to develop senior reel/portfolio piece).

Bit new to teaching so he's a bit shy, but still does a great job. Didn't find class challenging enough as we had a lot of free reign to complete projects in Photoshop/Illustrator/any program.
