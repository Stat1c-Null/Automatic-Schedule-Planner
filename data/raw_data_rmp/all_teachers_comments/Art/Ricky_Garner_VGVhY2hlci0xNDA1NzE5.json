I took him online and we honestly had one assignment that was due at the end of each week. He doesn't put grades in which is the only negative but he does email a couple of times throughout the semester to give you a grade update as far as what your grade is! Really easy class with him so take him if you can!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTE1MzI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARED3308","date_posted":"2018-08-07 17:27:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Garner is very unique. He is hard to get to know, but he is very intelligent and funny once you do get used to his dry sense of humor. He really lets you either sink or swim and he expects each of his students to give 100%. Overall, great professor :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNDExMjM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He can me mistaken as someone who doesnt care, but after you get to know him you learn his personality. he is very educated in what he teaches and helps you become a better teacher!

He gives you a lot of studio time to work on your portfolios, so there shouldn't be an issue of not completing them. Also as long as you show you are putting forth the effort in your artwork, that's all he cares about.  He's pretty funny and chill though so I would recommend him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTM2NzM4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARED3306","date_posted":"2017-02-07 15:13:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"He means well, he really does. He picks his favorites. Get on his good side. He has a tendency to tear you to shreds when doing a critique.

Expects greatness but understands if you are trying your best. He does give you work but nothing that can't be conquered. Book is required as well as attendance but I enjoyed every day I was there.

He didn't teach us anything new, he just told us to paint/draw something and he would come around and tell you something to &quot;make it better&quot; but it didn't help much. It was an easy A but very boring. Every class was just working on artwork that I could have finished in 1 class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTYzMDkz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
