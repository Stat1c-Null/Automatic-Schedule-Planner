Waited until the week before the withdrawal deadline to grade everything, only to grade incredibly harshly for anything he deemed not high enough effort. Zero opportunity for make up, no late turn ins, and no extra credit. Will fail you in a heartbeat with no remorse.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjgxMjcz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART3160","date_posted":"2022-10-26 22:08:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Constantly saying dreadful things about how being in art college is useless, all the while being a disruption when you're trying to concentrate. Doesn't respond to emails, or takes days to get back to you. After 2 absences, ANY absence drops you a letter grade. Acts like the most chill dude in the world, but is actually an EXTREMELY tough grader...","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzQxNDMy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART3160","date_posted":"2020-11-16 15:00:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class challenged me, there is a good bit of homework. Before taking this painting class be sure you have a bit of a budget saved up to buy the supplies. To put it simply, it's basic brushes, dish soap, odorless paint thinner, painting medium, 9&quot;/11&quot; &amp; 16&quot;/20&quot; canvases, &amp; oil paints. This is a great class to take &amp; the teacher is awesome!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODIzMzUw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Skip class?

There's only 2 absences though, so be careful. He has super fun &amp; unique projects, he is knowledgeable, and great for conversation. The class is pretty lax, sometimes he plays music. He allows headphones, and don't let the syllabus scare you off. He is a easy grader &amp; a fun teacher. I would recommend him to anyone!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjc0ODE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
