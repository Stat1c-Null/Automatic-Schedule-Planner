Theres 3 tests total and you have to visit a museum (theres one on campus) to submit a discussion post on. She responds to emails quickly and all of the discussion posts are based on the textbook/slideshows.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzQ4NTcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2020-04-30 17:25:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Hutchinson is a true gem. She has a heart of gold! She gives clear instructions and is always ready to help. You only have to do 4 discussion posts, 3 tests, and museum attendance/paper. Very easy class.

She's very helpful and knowledgable. However, she goes through instructions fast so pay attention. I thought it was going to be my least favorite class, but Hutchinson made it my favorite of the semester.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODExMDEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2020-01-01 23:55:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Only have to do 5 discussions, and you get to pick which ones. Otherwise, only 3 tests and a museum visit. Very easy class, textbook can be helpful for your tests and museum visit, but could get by without it.

However, in practice, she can be a bit disorganized and talks a lot in class (to the point of losing precious time on projects). Despite this, I would recommend her she is very knowledgeable.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjc0ODAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2017-11-16 01:12:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor and super easy class.
