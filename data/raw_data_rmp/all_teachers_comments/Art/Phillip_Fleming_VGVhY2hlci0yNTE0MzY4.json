If you do not enjoy still lifes you will hate this class too, you sit still for three hours in silence to draw. This class made me switch majors.

I'm not the best at drawing but he made the class feel accomplishable for everyone.

His tests werent great, they were strangely worded and hard to understand. He would take forever to grade assignments, so most of the semester you dont know what your grade is.

You were graded on 3 tests, a few online discussions, and a mandatory paper where you had to visit an art museum. His lectures are fast-paced and taken directly from the text.
