She is a very nice lady and willing to help you. I honestly went to the class about 6-7 times and got a C because I did very well on the exams.

For about a month all we did was presentations over pieces of art. I can't say I've really taken much out of this class. I'd go with another elective if possible.

Her tests are decently hard but not impossible. you must read a lot of the text and have incredible notes to even have a chance to get an A on the tests.

Not too bad of a class, just monotonous lectures. She's an approachable person who wants her students to do well. Study the book. Pay attention to what she says about paintings. Tests were decently hard. Not really sure how to prepare properly.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDE3NjYz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2010-04-17 18:17:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the most boring classes I've ever taken.
