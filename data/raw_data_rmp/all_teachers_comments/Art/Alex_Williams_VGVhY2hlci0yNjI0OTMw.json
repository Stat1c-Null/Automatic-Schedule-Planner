Classmates were awesome which made it bearable. Instructor was very blunt, critical and comes across as condescending and arrogant. Often was contradictory with instructions for projects.

Has made me cry on several occasions. Grades way too harshly for hard work. Alex is very off putting and tries to be relatable but doesn't. Tends to put students down by what he says. Says derogatory and insensitive comments. Rarely says anything positive about work.

Weekly discussion posts. Takes a while to reply emails. We made a portrait, character design, imagined landscape, print a portfolio, and learned Illustrator, PS, &amp; InDesign.
