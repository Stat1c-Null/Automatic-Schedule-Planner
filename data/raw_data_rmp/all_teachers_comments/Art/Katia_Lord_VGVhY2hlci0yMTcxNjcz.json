Yes she can be hurtful during critiques and wants to see effort in your projects, but it is for your own benefit. She helps prepare you for the concentration portfolio and for the real world.

Refuses to help you and asks you to \"google it\" instead. Doesn't teach and spends all class showing us videos instead. I've gotten A's on all the projects so far, but it's no thanks to her. DO NOT take her unless absolutely necessary.
