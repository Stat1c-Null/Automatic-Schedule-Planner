Then there are 3 tests but no lockdown browser so they are all easy A's. You also have to go to an art museum and write a paper but its super easy.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTE5ODc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2024-11-27 00:35:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Su's class is easy.  There are discussions every week, that go with the textbook and provided videos. There are only a total of 3 tests and no final. Had to complete a museum analysis paper, it was easy and fun. He does not take long to grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDQwNzQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
