Had challenging material for everyone, regardless if they were a dance major or just had dance interest. Always smiling and full of energy.

She is so sweet! She gives a lot of extra credit. The paper assignments she gives are very easy. It was a very interesting class. The class discussions never had awkward silences like most classes. She also really cares about her students. We had coffee together to talk about my college meltdowns. She really cares.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzI5MTk1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC1107","date_posted":"2012-12-12 15:36:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy class. No book needed. Talks about different dances and uses videos and movies to make the lectures more interesting. Loves to get you involved by having discussions or by making you participate. Must attend 2 performances, but they were actually interesting. DO NOT miss over 4 days and this will be a very easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDM5OTMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANCE1107","date_posted":"2012-11-18 07:46:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor gives lots of extra credit opportunities and she explains the content well. Sometimes she talks a little over the head of the nondancers in the class, but it's nothing that affects her teaching or your performance in the class.  There are two concerts to and attend with a paper assignment on each of them. Responds to emails quickly!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODU3MDMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANC1107","date_posted":"2012-11-17 10:17:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is really sweet and nonchalant. She gives you plenty of opportunities to make an A. It's such an easy class. The only thing is that you can only have 4 absences, but this is a class you would want to go to. I'm not even a dancer and I would highly recommend it. She's only made us dance once, and it was not as bad as you would think.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODU0Mzg3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DANCE1107","date_posted":"2012-11-05 22:08:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a professional dancer so she knows what she is talking about. She likes the class to get up and participate and often forgot some students were not dancers.
