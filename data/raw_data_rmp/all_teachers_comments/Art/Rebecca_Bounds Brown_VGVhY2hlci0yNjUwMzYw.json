Easy quizzes, can check if your answer is right (not lockdown browser, so can look at book too). Most annoying thing are the art criticisms, which aren't too hard, just put the work in and you should get a good grade. The final is a bit ridiculous, 100 questions on random things through the sem, so you can't  really study but not too hard","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODI1Nzkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2023-07-11 18:24:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her figure drawing class will push you to grasp proportions of the human body. The key things to remember when taking her class is time management and attendance. Group and class critique are mandatory. You will spend most of class drawing live models. I would not take the class again because she made a strange racially specific comment to me.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDk3OTMx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2023-04-20 01:08:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loved this class, haven't taken final yet. Take her! Grading is very fair. Multiple quizzes but they come with check ur answer button to help you get better answers& the quizzes balance out ur overall grade.

There were weekly quizzes but if you just apply yourself to the course like you would with any other class then it shouldn't be that bad. The class overall was interesting.

If you want easy with little work it is good, but the way she grades the art criticisms is ridiculous. She grades based on her own personal opinions and expects the most.

Sadly, the content of the class was uninteresting and unengaging.
