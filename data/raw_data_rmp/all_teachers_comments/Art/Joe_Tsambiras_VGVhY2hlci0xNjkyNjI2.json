He is a fair grader; if you are making constant B's in class but start making A'a by the end, he will see it as improvement and give you an A in the class. He can come off as a little rude at times but he doesn't mean to be. Cool guy","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDkzNDU2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2150","date_posted":"2015-09-28 13:53:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a really good guy and he's a great artist. However, I think his expectations (drawing a life-size full body self-portrait in 2 weeks) are a bit much. You also need to come to class everyday (strict with attendance). If you're more comfortable drawing at home and are paying for this class, why can't we? Not everybody is a drawing major.

I learned a lot of new drawing techniques from him. He assigns projects every week and you usually get about 5 days to work on them. As long as you apply what you learn and turn in projects on time, you can get an A. I didn't get to finish some of my projects but i still passed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDMwODgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2014-11-07 12:27:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I absolutely LOVED having Mr. Tsambiras as my art professor. He has a lot of very interesting things to say that will help you not only as an artist, but as a person. You can see his true passion for art as a teacher and is just overall a very enjoyable person. If you are willing to work hard to better yourself as an artist, this class will be fun.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzY1NzA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2150","date_posted":"2014-08-16 00:13:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great man. Helpful and listens. WOrk hard and you will be rewarded. We talked one on one after class about a project for over an hour to make my final the best it could be, and I turned out great! I'm proud of the work done int that class, and it is great for my portfolio.

He grades VERY fairly, and is pretty lenient on late work. He tends to go off on a lot of tangents, but it makes for an interesting class. Also, if you're looking for work to build up your entrance portfolio, this is a great class to do so. He assigns projects weekly.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTM4NDkz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
