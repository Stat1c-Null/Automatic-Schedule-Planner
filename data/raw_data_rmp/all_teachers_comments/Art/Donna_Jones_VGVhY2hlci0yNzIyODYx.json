She was very easy to get a hold of and she is really good about reminders for exams or projects. There is one project where you have to go to an exam and write a short paper but that was probably the \"hardest part.\" Take her if you want an easy class.

It's like she understands that majority of us are just taking this class because we have to, not because we're art majors. As long as you turn everything in, this class is such an easy A. The assignments are so easy. No camera on exams and everything is open note. Super, super easy class. Definitely recommend.

She condenses any &amp; all lectures she does to the best of her ability to make it easier to understand, &amp; had very little assignments; her doing kahoots REALLY helped on exams.
