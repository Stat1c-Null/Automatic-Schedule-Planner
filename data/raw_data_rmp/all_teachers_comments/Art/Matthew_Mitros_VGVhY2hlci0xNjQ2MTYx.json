He should not teach 3d. the projects were lame and with little creativity or inspiration involved. He's attractive but that all goes away when he starts talking. He makes a better artist then teacher. Dry humor was ok but then he makes it annoying.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTc3MDg3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1200","date_posted":"2012-07-16 18:52:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"every once a week we had a quiz, 5questions that are from each chapter form the text book. not too hard, but needs study.
