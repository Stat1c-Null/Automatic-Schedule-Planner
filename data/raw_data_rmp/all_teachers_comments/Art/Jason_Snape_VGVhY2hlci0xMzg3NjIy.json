One of the few professors that actually allows you to expand your own artistic style rather than trying to mold it to to a commercial standard. Unfortunately he no longer teaches at Kennesaw, but if teachers in your school DEFINITELY take him. You will learn key design techniques and leave a much better artist.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTc2NDg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2550","date_posted":"2010-11-11 15:52:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Snape is very eager to teach and is definitely helpful. I don't think his projects are hard although I usually make B's on the projects because Computer applications in art is not at all my interest. He is very knowledgeable about his subject and he is easier on people who are not a graphic design major.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzU0NzU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
