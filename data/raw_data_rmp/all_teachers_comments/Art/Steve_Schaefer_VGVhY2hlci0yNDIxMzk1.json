His class is expensive, unclear, and extremely presumptuous of pre-existing talent. If you arent already a professional photographer, dont take this class. He was rude and abrasive nearly all semester. I was one of three students to not withdraw out of the 16 total.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjU2MTUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He is rude, unclear, and is not fit to be a teacher. I have no doubt he's a good photojournalist, but I have no idea how this guy has taught since 1991 as he is loud, argumentative, and gives feedback in the most demeaning and degrading way possible. I have 0 respect for him...","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzI0MTA0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He's incredibly rude to students, has said he is a god to photography, constantly interrupts students during presentations, always speaks over you to tell you you're wrong before you've said a word, and says your photos are bad before you even show him your images.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzAwODM5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART3410","date_posted":"2019-01-10 23:48:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was both time consuming and incredibly expensive. The professor does very little teaching, and is easily irritated. He gives out a lot of work, but provides very little time to complete it, while at the same time expecting high quality work out of his students. Very interesting class, but the professor should be more accessible.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMjQwODQ2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"11306ART","date_posted":"2018-11-08 10:41:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst class I have ever taken. He is not meant to be a professor of any sorts. He bases everything off of his opinions, not facts. He mocks and argues with everything you say, he contradicts everything he says, so it makes it impossible to know what he wants. He doesnt give good direction, and he is very rude. Also this class was very EXPENSIVE!!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjg0MTk4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
