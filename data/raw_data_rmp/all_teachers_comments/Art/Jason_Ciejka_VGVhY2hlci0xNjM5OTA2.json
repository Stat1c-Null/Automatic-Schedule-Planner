Everything was easy especially the presentation, that was not that bad, but his test was not that easy which shock me. But he gave like 10-15 point curve on every test except the final.

I only attend class on the review day before the quiz and on quiz day and I have a high A! The first week when I did attend, he lectures all class period. He is a great professor, but his lectures are very boring.

Easiest A, ever. 3 quizzes. I got a 105 on the first and a 98 on the 2nd so far. He curves all the tests 10-15 points each. Ppts all online and he's really nice. People who complain about his class obviously don't try to put any effort into his class. One day he got people to sign a piece of paper of who was there for extra credit","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTg3NzM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2012-03-25 16:35:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good teacher, but the most boring class ever. He literally lectures the entire 75 minutes. He loves to hear himself talk. Tough quizzes, usually about 40 questions.

He absolutely loves art history and is very articulate in his lectures. Very concise, and he'll help you 101% if you ask him about anything- takes the time to actually ask if you have an questions and is eager to help.
