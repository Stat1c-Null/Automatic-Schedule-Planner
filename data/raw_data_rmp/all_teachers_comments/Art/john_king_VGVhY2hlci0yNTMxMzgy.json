You have weeks to do your assignments, and he gives very clear instructions and feedback for your work. I only wish he wasn't so strict on attendance, but I can understand why he is. Overall great guy.

Although he is very laid back, he can be a bit strict on attendance, so make sure to show up if you can! His projects are not that difficult and he gives you plenty of time to work on them. He gives great feedback all throughout the process, and grades well.

He goes to extremes to explain everything thoroughly and is always extremely helpful when you have questions. He goes over everything slowly and cares if you understand correctly. He also has a great sense of humor and makes class fun. If you get the chance to take him do it! Very personable and an overall great man.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzgyODY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
