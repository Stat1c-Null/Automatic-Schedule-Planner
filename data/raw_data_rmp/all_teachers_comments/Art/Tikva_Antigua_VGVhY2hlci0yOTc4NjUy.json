Classwork is nice independent work. She gives demos almost every class to help set you up plus provides PowerPoints for even MORE help. Easy homework 1 a week.

She's a new professor and a very nice person so I cut her some slack, but this class wasn't great. Most class periods we just worked with no engaging feedback or critique (at that point why am I coming into class when I could work at home?) However, she graded very pretty fairly in my experience.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDEzMDA3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"17224","date_posted":"2024-05-27 15:19:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"I was frustrated with this class. I wouldn't mind the mandatory attendance if the class was worthwhile. she doesn't teach and the projects are repetitive but my main problem was CRITIQUE. We had to attend class but we sat there on our computers and wrote in a discussion post. Don't take if you actually want to learn anything because I didn't.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTI1Mzgw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"17224","date_posted":"2024-05-10 04:30:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Attendance is mandatory even though you don't do anything in the class except your projects which you can easily do at home, plus she doesn't even make an effort to teach. She's nice but she's not good as a professor in my opinion.

I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she is a new teacher, but STILL. She doesn't teach and expects you to know what to do.

She is a harsh grader and includes any practices you did beforehand. If you take her be prepared to put 100% effort into every assignment. Also what she says and presents to the class is often not even the project, and her explanations are confusing. I would pay close mind to the project rubrics online.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDE2MTI0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
