If you have any problem that prevents you from attending class, she will not care. You'd think during a pandemic she'd be more understanding towards students when they say they have medical issues, or need to get a COVID test, but nope. Good luck if you take her. She's a nightmare.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzcyNjMw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Skip class?

Yeah, there was quite a lot of work to be done, but it wasn't taking too much of my time. It helps to have experience in Adobe. Please participate and answer questions, she will like it. Try to do your work early. My advice: take her online class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzQxNTg2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Skip class?

The only assignment that was clearly explained was the bi-weekly homework done based off a textbook. Her tutorials were missing steps and she is not willing to help you when youre struggling if she does not feel like its hard.

Gets mad at people for asking questions. She means well but comes off as rude and doesnt have respect for students. I dont think shes had a good attitude a single day this whole semester and takes it out on us. Also is very unclear with assignments. Hope she doesnt act like this with her clients.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODYzOTA1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART2550","date_posted":"2020-09-29 18:59:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"She doesn't specify half of the requirements for projects so you pretty much drop a letter grade just from that. For example, I turned in a project on the due date and got points off because apparently she wants you to turn it in a day early. She never said this to our class though so most of us got points off for that. It is frustrating.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjY5MDI0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

She is very easy to talk to and gives feedback that I usually think is very helpful. I have had her for Computer Applications as well and she's really patient with students.

She expects way too much out of beginners. If I did not have experience already in what we learned, I surely would have failed.
