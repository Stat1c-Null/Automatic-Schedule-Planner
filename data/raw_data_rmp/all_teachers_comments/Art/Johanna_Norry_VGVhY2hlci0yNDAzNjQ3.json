I took ART3860 with her this semester and she is so informative and knowledgeable when discussing projects and showing hands-on demos. She can answer any question you have, and she loves when students are engaging in critique. To me, she is an easy grader and can always see the good in a student's artwork. ,","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDc1OTgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ATT1300","date_posted":"2025-04-15 01:04:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Its actually art 1107, overall its a pretty easy class, online book, test were hard just due to the amount of information given and focusing one very little subject matter about the picture. religion or materials used, 40 or so images you have to remember things about, its not that hard. overall fairly easy class as far as work goes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTQwMjUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ATT3505","date_posted":"2019-07-02 15:03:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Norry is new to the ATT department, but she is well informed of the fashion world. She gives very detailed lectures and uploads the slides on d2l which is where most of her tests are from so it's pretty hard to fail her class.
