There were few students in my class. like 6, so it was hard not to participate. She is extremely knowledgeable of how to properly respond to your classroom and in my opinion an expert art teacher. There are few things that you are graded on as she focuses more on learning than on giving out grades.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODI4ODM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ERTED3309","date_posted":"2017-05-03 13:59:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Munson's class was one of my favorite professors this semester. She does a great job of explaining art and how it be incorporated into different subjects. Each class was very relaxing. You will be amazed at how much she helps you become an artist. If you are debating taking art online or in-class, take this class with Professor Munson!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTk4NTIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARED3309","date_posted":"2016-06-01 11:52:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Munson is super chill and an all around great professor. I took her for an Art Education class for a maymester and enjoyed going to classes very much. Her class pretty much seemed like therapy, it was great!
