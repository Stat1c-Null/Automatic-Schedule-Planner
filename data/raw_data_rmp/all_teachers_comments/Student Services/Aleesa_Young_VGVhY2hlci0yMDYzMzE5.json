Assignments were random and were hardly discussed in lecture or reflected what was being instructed. Lecture and homework was more about activism rather than highlighting important points in the text. She did respect all view points though and is a very nice.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTI0OTY3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-12-22 15:15:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Sweetest woman ever. She has \"relaxation time\" for everyone during the class which lowkey helps. As long as you know whats going on and pay attention to rubrics and deadlines you'll get an easy A. She does demand respect though so don't think she'll let you sleep and get away with not paying attention, but it's easy to since she's so entertaining.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjA0Mzgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-11-04 00:38:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Young is very nice, but she is very work heavy. Lots of projects from the book, volunteer hours, and homework (every class). She only has 1 test and that's the midterm, and allows 3 \"Crisis Coupons\" for late work that last for 2 weeks. She also does meditation every class which can either be really helpful or really boring.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTI4MjE5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GROUP PROJECTS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2015-12-20 11:40:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ms. Young tries her best to inspire her students. Any KSU seminar class is going to be mainly busy work so you just have to accept that and do the work. It's easy. She's cool and funny if you give her a chance. Don't let the fact that it is a pointless class get in the way of your grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NzgwMDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2015-11-11 20:46:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the worst classes I have taken. Beware of volunteering many hours with little time to complete it. Also beware of numerous and countless assignments. This seminar class was more stress than it should have been.
