If you are taking this class just because it's required, then it may seem very boring. There are two tests, a lot of group projects, and a lot of assignments involving taking selfies. Lots of class discussions. If you take a lot of notes you won't need the textbook.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjI4OTg5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--GROUP PROJECTS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
