When I told her the school did not have enough cameras for that, she looked at me and said, &quot;That's not my problem.&quot; Apparently got in trouble for that assignment later and had to change it to a group project to ensure we could all get cameras.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMDA3MTY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"JOUR3340","date_posted":"2018-12-13 21:46:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor was fun in the classroom and great at giving feedback right after presenting. However, she never posted a single grade throughout the semester. Group projects took up a lot of time outside the classroom and were tedious. Very stressful class, but fun if you're into broadcasting.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDEyODQy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"JOUR3340","date_posted":"2018-12-11 11:53:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Weatherspoon is a great choice for digital media production. She was very helpful at learning the Adobe editing software. On the first day, she assured us that no one would fail and this class is a learning experience. As long as you do the work. The hardest part of the class is coordinating everyone's schedule for group projects.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTYyNjU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JOUR3340","date_posted":"2018-01-09 00:44:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Weatherspoon was amazing. She knows what she's doing and strives to teach students the same thing. We got to use awesome equipment and she challenged us to make stories as if we were real reporters. Be prepared to do the work and not just try to get by. Its a great learning opportunity so take advantage of it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDE3Nzgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
