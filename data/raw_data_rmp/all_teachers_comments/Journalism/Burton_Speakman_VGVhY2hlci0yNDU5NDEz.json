There's weekly assignments, some quizzes, and 4 major assignments, but the class isn't hard. Pretty much, if you just do the work and follow the assignment guidelines, then you'll easily pass the class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDkwODE5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JOUR4488","date_posted":"2022-08-24 02:21:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Speakman is amazing! He is not only an honest professor but an experienced journalist who wants to help his students succeed.

Took him for one of my lower-level COM classes and again for my Capstone. You can really tell he wants the best for his students. He worked with me and helped when he didn't have to to make sure I got the grade I needed in the class. Easily accessible and grades VERY fast.

His lessons are really helpful and he gives clear examples. He is a tough grader on assignments, but he gives clear criteria and great feedback.

He is one of my favorite profs here at Kennesaw. He really works from a real-life kind of mentality. If you don't have to do it in the field, he is not going to make you do it in class. For Investigative reporting, we just have updates that we have to give him and the final project. Those are the only real grades.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMzA1MDU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
