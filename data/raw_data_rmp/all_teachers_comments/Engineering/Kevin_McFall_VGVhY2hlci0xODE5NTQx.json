His grading on HWs, labs, and tests is super strict. I regret taking it coz my  other class got distracted  and I am EE major. Tests don't come from previous exams, HWs, slides, or quizzes.

He can be a little some of the material he teaches can be difficult and he will force you to think through the material but he is a very fair teacher.

I would definitely recommend taking him for any and every class he teaches.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzYwMzUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
