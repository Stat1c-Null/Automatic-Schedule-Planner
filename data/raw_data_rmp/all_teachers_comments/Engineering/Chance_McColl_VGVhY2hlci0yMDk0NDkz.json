Dr. McColl prioritizes learning over grades and will do anything to ensure student success. I especially loved how he applied theory into real world application in industry. Highly recommend him for any class he's teaching!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDQ1MDEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COE3001","date_posted":"2018-04-18 18:11:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"He taught my GT def bods class and is amazing. He is really good about working examples and relating the material to actual examples. He is organized, approachable, accessible, and good at explaining things-a great professor. He also has a great sense of humor and is really cool- he makes drones and plays double left-handed guitar in a band.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODM1NDg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3122","date_posted":"2015-12-26 10:53:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. McColl is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is very passionate about the subject and obviously enjoys teaching. Dynamics is not an easy subject but his lectures are very clear and he gives you many extra credit opportunities. It also helps that he has a pretty sarcastic sense of humor and is just an all-around cool guy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODI2NDM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
