I wish I could say what I got in the class, but have absolutely no idea. He constantly makes excuses for his own disorganization.

Never responded or cared it seems the second he leaves the room. In such crucial subjects to learn, you will finish the class not knowing much and learning very little from him.

Have not received a grade for any lab throughout the semester (at time of writing, it's finals week) nor received a response to any of the numerous emails I've sent him. Just dumped two labs on us during finals week after neglecting to send anything since the school was shut down.

Will not respond to any emails or text messages from the many forms of communication he gives you. Expect to get grades back weeks to months later. Does not teach theory or direct materials but rather his own experience. Very confusing at times with material.

He teaches the practical side of hydrology and less theory. Tests aren't that hard if you pay attention in class and he usually will emphasize what is on the tests. He does give pop quizzes but they're super easy if you just listen to what he says the class before.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTY3ODcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CE4703","date_posted":"2017-05-15 13:24:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor McClain structured this course to follow what he does in his job. His lectures are thorough and very interesting. He does an excellent job teaching the material. He doesn't give many HWs or quizzes, but they are straightforward. 3 tests, and does a review for each test the class before.

Pop quizzes are not difficult if u show up to class. He doesn't have many handouts or slides, feels like he just wings it in lecture. He is repetitive over things he'll put in the test.
