Machine Design was probably the hardest class of my academic career but I learned so much. The homework is long and difficult, but the tests are easy by comparison. Do not take this class if you expect a low effort A, only do so if you want to be a better engineer.

His lectures are definitely acceptable but his grading is very tough. He also holds a very high opinion of himself, in his eyes, he can do no wrong despite having blatant errors in his tests that he's too proud to make right by the students. Take him if you have to, but most professors are a better option.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTM2MjYx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ME4141","date_posted":"2021-02-10 17:04:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is a class where you are tested for your obedience instead of your knowledge of the subject. He requires an irrationally heavy amount of work.

I would say he cares more about teaching you the subject then all negative reviews show. I took him for machine design previously and spent hours on his homework, but I learned machine design.
