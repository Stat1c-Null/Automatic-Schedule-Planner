His lecture notes are really valuable, and if you pay attention, you'll learn a lot. The course has just 5 homework assignments and 2 tests all semester, so the grading is fair and you can often get better scores than you expect.

The homework is almost identical to the exams so make sure you pay attention and do the work. Would definitely take his class if you want a good grasp of fluids and a high grade (he hates giving out C's or lower grades but he will give them out, so don't slack off ).","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDg4NzUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR-3343","date_posted":"2024-03-26 16:16:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best fluid mechanics professor at kennesaw state, Professor Shi knows his material and teaches it very well.

His lectures are clear, engaging, and surpass other professors at KSU. He is knowledgeable, patient, and understanding, fostering a positive learning environment. The final grading is unexpectedly high, and I highly recommend his courses for anyone interested in fluid mechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODU0ODUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
