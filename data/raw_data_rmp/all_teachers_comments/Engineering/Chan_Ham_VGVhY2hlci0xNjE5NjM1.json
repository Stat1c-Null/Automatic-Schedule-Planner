He didn't really like me as a student but, that didn't matter. I did well in his class because he teaches the material like a true Ph.D professor. Work hard for your grade. I recommend this man.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDk2NTE0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CONTROLSYSTEMS","date_posted":"2014-07-29 16:35:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Ham is an amazing professor.

He is enthusiastic and well prepared for class. He makes every subject easily understandable. You just need to pay attention to his lecture. I didnâ€™t know that the modeling of dynamic systems is so easy till I took his class.

His language comprehension and communication skills make asking questions difficult. Teaching methods are poor and confusing. Very little real world examples/studies. Study outside of class and stay on his \"good side\" to get an easy grade. Course load is usually not bad. No help with labs. Good luck!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDgwMDE0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":6,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
