He is very careful about how to make comments on/rephrase/respect students' responses/questions. He may have a bit of strong accent: a different blend of exoticness and excitement coming out of his \"unique\" personaliy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NjYyNTE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME3101","date_posted":"2017-05-15 09:58:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Mirgolbabaei is the best professor ever!! Clear breakdown of your grade percentages is presented. His grading is not too strict, he focuses on 'your' learning. There will be many lectures and power points presentations, which are very effective. There are only 2 tests (Midterm and Final). You have a bit of reading to do-easy A. I recommend!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzEyNjkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
