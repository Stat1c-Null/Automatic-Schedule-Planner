The other lab reports are considered your presentations. He's not a hard professor as long as you do your work and get everything done by the due date. He also helps you if you have any questions and is understanding of other classwork loads. Take him!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjgwNzQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2020-05-11 19:23:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a nice guy and a pretty good professor. He is not too hard with grading and there are plenty of assignments to get grades on. However, it does take weeks to get grades back on test and he does not use the d2l software to store grades. He is very smart and easy to understand. I liked him and would take him again if needed.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjY1MTUx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
