Labs are pretty much non-existant. Class subject will include things learned in ECET3000 but you probably forgot & don't be the fool that falls for Yon's tricks. The Final pject & Final lab will be insane & not be mentioned at all during the semester.

You will not discuss anything useful, you will not have any grades, there will be no assignments, you might do one or two labs, then you'll have a final project and a final exam over topics that were not even remotely close to anything mentioned in class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDY4MTY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
