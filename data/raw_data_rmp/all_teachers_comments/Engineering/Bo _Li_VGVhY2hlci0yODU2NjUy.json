He makes his grading system where he prioritizes you learning the material rather than worrying about the grade. In thermo he only requires a 69 in the class to get a B.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjYwNDgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME-1311","date_posted":"2024-12-11 05:12:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"He made it really easy to get an A in the class. He double curves all his tests. He also gives almost an exact practice test for every one. The final is a project which is graded by the other students, who usually give everyone a 100%. It is a really easy A. Highly recommend, but you might not learn a lot from him. You will need outside help.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjE1OTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME-1311","date_posted":"2023-12-08 21:44:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Going into this MATLab class, I was scared since I'm really new to coding but this professor changed that.
