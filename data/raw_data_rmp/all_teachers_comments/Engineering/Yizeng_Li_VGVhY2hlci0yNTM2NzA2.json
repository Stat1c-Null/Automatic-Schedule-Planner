The homework was a completion grade, and her quizzes and tests were all open textbooks (print textbooks). She had a project at the end of the year that you could gain extra credit for, and she also gave out other EC opportunities. She was very nice and accessible as well.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MjQ1ODQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME3101","date_posted":"2021-07-16 16:01:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"From my experience with professor Li, as long as you show up to class and have the textbook, you are already on pace to pass the class. She allows you to use your textbook for quizzes/tests. With that being said, you still need to put in the effort if you want to get an A, tests are not difficult, but if you don't study, you won't get an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTcyNDQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME3101","date_posted":"2021-05-12 19:16:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Yizeng Li is very open to criticism. She posted two anonymous surveys to get a sense of the class feeling. What I did not like about her and the class is the class is very textbook heavy lectures. Test are hard, especially problems because past examples look nothing like it. The final project is not explained. Extra credit is given alot.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Nzc2NzM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ME3131","date_posted":"2020-05-05 23:07:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"I strongly disagree with all the above feedbacks. The course itself is very hard and lot of material to cover. I failed the first test with the low grade but talked to her and she is always willing to help. One of the best professor I have ever taken. Pay attention in class and do your homework you will be fine. She gives lots of extra credit.

She reads directly from the book, you have to teach yourself the material, and if you derive formulas and do not show on the quizzes and exams you'll be lucky to get a point, and that's if you solve it correctly. And to comment on the testing,the practice does not relate at all!

You feel like the best isn't good enough for her. the Review Research she has you do is torture because you need to read 5 what seem like graduate school research papers. She expect us to understand a course that should honestly be split into 2 classes. It's just too much to handle for one semester.

That's the best to describe her. Trying your best isn't even enough for her. I leaned nothing about heat transfer from her.

Even if you must take the class. It is not worth it. Her power points and examples are all from the book, but her hw and tests are nothing like it. If you like solving problems using advanced math take her. She's hard to understand is absolutely unhelpful when you need help.
