Dr. Li is a caring professor who will explain whatever you need her to, and she's available outside class if needed.  Also, 25% of your grade is group projects, so find a good group to work with.

All her classes typically have weekly/monthly quizzes, two exams, and an optional final exam which cannot hurt you. This is the first semester she taught ISYE 3350, and she taught it well.

She always came to class with a positive attitude and taught the lecture material perfectly.

Her lectures were just powerpoints that you could go through at home, but it makes more sense if you attend class. Her tests were tough, but she is a fair grader if you just put effort into your answer. She gave a couple of easy quizzes that you could work on with classmates. Overall great teacher.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzgyNzY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISYE3400","date_posted":"2021-05-06 21:47:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Li is the best. She truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed, and will do everything in her power to make sure you do well in her class.

If you do not watch lectures you will not pass! Make sure you follow all instructions to a T or you will get a lower grade even if you have the right answer in the wrong format.
