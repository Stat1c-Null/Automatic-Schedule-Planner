I'd taking any other Prof. All of his classes are taken from past professors but over the years parts of the lessons have been lost. His accent isn't that strong but the online lectures are inaudible due to audio issues. The real issue is his disinterested in fixing any issue. His classes/exams are unpredictable.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjU2OTk4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET3325","date_posted":"2022-03-01 17:30:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a good professor. It's a tough subject. The two tests were hard. But the final is helpful and will improve your grade if you truly study.

His voice and way of lecturing is very monotone and does very little examples.

The class was hybrid but his lectures were powerpoints read word for word too quickly to take any notes. He made the class a lot more difficult than it should have been. If you get stuck with him stick it out but otherwise take someone else.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTg2MDU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
