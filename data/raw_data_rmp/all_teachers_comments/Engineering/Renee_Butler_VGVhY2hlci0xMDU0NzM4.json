The homework is numerous and will take hours to complete (and most likely you will need to get help from her to finish it). The tests are doable and easier than the homework, but still tough. You have to buy a textbook, and do a group project near the end of the course. Can be a tough grader.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzUyMjc5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SYE3300","date_posted":"2016-06-17 17:41:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took her for another class previously and found her to be nice & an easy grader. However, in this class during the later half she seemed to grade the last 2 projects way too hard. Also !EXTREMELY! hard to reach outside of class. There's 3 projects and 2 tests (midterm and final). Did I mention she's extremely hard to reach outside of class?","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NzM1NzEw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SYE3400","date_posted":"2015-04-26 19:31:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty easy grader, but expect regular homeworks that will take hours to finish. Tests are open notes and open book. Only negative is she pretty hard to contact for help outside of class as she's never in her office and doesn't usually answer emails.

Her instruction of Engineering Economics was very easy paced, even for a summer course. She was very clear on her explanations and all of her test questions were similar to textbook cases, so no surprises out there. Would recommend as an instructor any day.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTk5NDQz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPSU1101","date_posted":"2012-11-02 12:16:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"is not helpful, does not respond to emails. not even a good teacher","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzY4NjQ3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET4405","date_posted":"2010-04-24 17:00:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor! Highly recommended.  Does the best best she can to make a very dry subject as fun as possible.  Grades fairly on tests and will spend the time to help you out if you need it.  She also provides opportunities for extra credit.

The class was over a difficult subject and she made it easier to grasp. Example tests are identical to real tests. Pick up a solutions manual for the homework (about 5 problems weekly) and you have an easy B, at least.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NzgzODcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET4405","date_posted":"2007-11-13 21:39:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very patient and fair.
