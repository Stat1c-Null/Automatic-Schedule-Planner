The project is done over the entire semester which gives plenty of time and the exams are fine as long as you are familiar with the material. She is extremely understanding if anything happens or you need a little extra time.

She only graded the hw for completion because of being slow to grade it. This did worry me because for most of the semester I had no idea what my grade was but it worked out in the end. The project was due half way in the semester, which I liked because less to worry about later on.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzUxMTk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET0000","date_posted":"2021-03-19 03:19:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have had the pleasure of taking Dr. Ergai for several classes now and have thoroughly enjoyed them all. She is very personable and truly cares for her students, I never felt hesitant to ask questions. She explains criteria and lectures well, I would certainly recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDUyNTYw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3325","date_posted":"2019-04-23 01:14:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Ergai is an excellent professor. She explains materials pretty well, but sometimes her teaching way is harder than it should be. Her class is a bit boring. As long as you do the quiz, practice problem, and ask her if you have questions, you will do well in her class. Her test is not bad at all.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjQ3NzQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
