Oh was constantly late, ended classes very early, didn't &quot;teach&quot; class. His grades were all or nothing, he modified the class schedule to take days off. He was extremely disrespectful and brought his KID to class on more then one occasion. Even with a study group, we failed his class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTg3NTM3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CE1000","date_posted":"2011-01-20 22:12:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had him for CE Orientation. He really didn't care what u did as long as u showed up and at least ask a question every class. Very funny if u get him going off topic. Suck up to him and u'll do fine. Only 3 projects: 1 paper,2 power points that are easy. The final was a power point where u had to interview 5 CEs. BS it if u want. Got an A doing that","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MTY1NDQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2010-07-31 07:13:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great professor and explains everything in extreme detail, but grading is brutal. If an answer is wrong there is no partial credit. He does use a curve at the end, so don't be on the bottom.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDY3MTIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2009-12-04 12:58:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice guy!
