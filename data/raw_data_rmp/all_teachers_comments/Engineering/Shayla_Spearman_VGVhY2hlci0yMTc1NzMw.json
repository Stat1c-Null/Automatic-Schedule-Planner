We had to do 2 group &quot;supply chain games.&quot; These games are extremely confusing and unclear as she does not explain properly what to do. It was like we were teaching ourselves what to do.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzUxNzQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IET2449","date_posted":"2021-12-11 01:06:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Just one wrong question will get you a B for a test.

Only a few assignments worth major chunks of your grade. The exams were nothing like the material in the powerpoints so there was nothing to study. She would take months to grade assignments...

She only has about 8 assignments including 3 exams which each are worth 25% of your grade. The exams only have 10-11 questions and if you miss 2 or 3 your grade will be low. The questions have nothing to do with the PowerPoints and be prepared to read even though some of the answers are not in the textbook either.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzE2NTc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IET4151","date_posted":"2020-05-13 17:14:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have taken Professor Spearman for a few classes, but this semester was Operations Management for Engineers. There wasn't a lot of work, but when there was it was really simple to answer. I would suggest getting the book, but I found it unnecessary. The exams and quizzes were simple and the answers could be found in her lessons.

Reads from the slides.  Doesn't interact with online students, even though she DEMANDS they attend all classes.  Cannot use the tech for the online students adequately. Frequent guest speakers & if they don't show she has no back up plan.  You just sit waiting until they show or she cancels the class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDI4NzIx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
