Emailed him about links having \"admin only\" directory and he did not fix the links. Homework assignments say one thing, but he emailed 1 student the separate instructions. Quizzes are on sundays and you have 1.5 hours to take them, which just throws away the flexibility of taking an online class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTY5OTA2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MET2501","date_posted":"2022-02-16 17:46:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"I heard this teacher was good, but not anymore. If you ask him a question or for help, he repeats himself louder. It is very frustrating and unproductive. I felt like the whole class was unwilling to ask questions a few weeks in. He does not really help his students, just repeats his vague instructions. If you want to learn do NOT take his class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1ODU4NzA2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MET2501","date_posted":"2022-01-28 14:49:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not a good professor. First off, he says he will update d2L with lecture notes, but 4 weeks into class d2L is still empty. Miss 1 day of class and youre extremely behind with no ways to catch up. There is no detailed schedule, so you never know when theres a quiz.

HW problems are much tougher than the test & quiz problems. When he is lecturing he is very straightforward and clear, he really is able to dumb things down & teach the main concepts.
