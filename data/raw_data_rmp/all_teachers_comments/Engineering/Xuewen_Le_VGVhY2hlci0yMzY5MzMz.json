The semester started off a bit slow, but he seemed to be getting more confident throughout the semester. Really enjoys people participating when working through problems. If you feel like youve been graded too harshly, hell revise it without being offended by it like some other teachers. Great choice!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTk1Nzcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Skip class?

He's laid back in the labs, but the reports are where it breaks down. Every report is a formal lab report, and he doesn't tell you what he's looking for in the reports, so you have to find out through trial and error. He often gave my group 70%-80% on the reports without telling us why, so we didn't know how to improve.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTYwODEy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CE4177","date_posted":"2018-05-22 11:17:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Get ready to teach yourself the course.
