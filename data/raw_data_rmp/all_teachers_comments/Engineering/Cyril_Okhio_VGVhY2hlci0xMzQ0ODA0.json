It sort of relates to senior design but I could've learned all of this in 2-3 weeks myself rather then 15 presentations over a semester and loads of busy work. He is also very forgiving on grades. Will let you resubmit until you get a 90+ on the assignment. Also cares about his students alot!

We made a lot of powerpoints that reviews articles of the design system your group chose for a senior project idea. Very picky on what he wants in the slide, must be in a template he provides, likes pictures and graphs and good citations. If you made a mistake, email him and he'll allow you to fix it.

No doubt one of the beat professors to be around, spends a lot of class preparing you for the FE and your career.
