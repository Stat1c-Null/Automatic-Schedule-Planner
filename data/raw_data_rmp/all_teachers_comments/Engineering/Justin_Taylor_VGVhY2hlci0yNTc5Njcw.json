I feel like I know less about SolidWorks than I did when I took him and I've had to entirely prepare myself for the CSWA. If you value your knowledge and GPA, don't take him.

I doubt he ever got his CSWA. So disappointing. Still waiting to get our first grades back, a month left of school.

Doesnt teach you anything, he just ask you to create solidworks drawing from the book. Which even himself DOES NOT KNOW how to make. And if you ask him for help he creates some weird angles and what not to pass the time. And also he tells you to figure stuff out.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDAxODky","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENG1212","date_posted":"2020-03-29 18:29:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"No grades have been given back yet and it is almost April. Dude doesn't know Solidworks. His class is a joke. He points to random pictures in the book and wants us to model them, but when asked for help he can't do it himself. He doesn't use D2L at all, no grades, no post for HW, no due dates posted, no instructions, nothing. AVOID HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDAxNDQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDG1212","date_posted":"2020-03-24 01:43:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"New to KSU, doesn't care about the class, &amp; knows nothing about SolidWorks. Very unclear w/ what is expected in class such as assignments or due dates &amp; has not graded a thing even halfway through the semester. If you skip class, he expects you to ask classmates for the hw and for help with anything you missed. Doesn't teach, gives random classwork","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTg4NTEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
