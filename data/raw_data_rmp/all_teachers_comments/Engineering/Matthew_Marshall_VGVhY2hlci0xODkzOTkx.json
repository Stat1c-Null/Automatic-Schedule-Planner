He opens the entire course at the beginning of the semester so you can finish the class in the first couple weeks if you want. He has one 5 question quiz for each \"week\" that do not use lockdown browser and has only 6 other assignments to complete and is a super easy grader.

I got to do it all, I got too work with my hands and come up with really cool solutions to real world problems.

His teaching style is a little different than others, he has online lectures that you need to watch before classes and take notes. Then in class he might work out an example or just jump straight into the lass exercise which you probably wont finish in class, he's there, so you can ask questions.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Mjg0NTEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MTRE3710","date_posted":"2016-05-31 20:19:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best professor to take Mechatronics Fundamentals.
