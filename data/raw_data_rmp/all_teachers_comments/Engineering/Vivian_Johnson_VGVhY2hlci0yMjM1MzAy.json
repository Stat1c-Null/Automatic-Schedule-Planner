During the semester I stayed after class numerous times for help. He was patient and took the time to make sure I understood exactly what to do. He even met with me online on a Sunday night to help me with HW problems I was having trouble with.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjY4MTYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2","date_posted":"2018-05-01 10:23:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is good professor. He is usually stick with basics. If you do want to undestand deeply in to course knowledge, ask him specifically otherwise he will stick with basics. Best advise, solve and understand the practice exams as soon as possible and ask the questions. His attitude is very respectful toward to his student.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTQ0MzA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGT3124","date_posted":"2018-04-26 17:48:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Johnson is an all-around great professor. He is informative, both in class and outside of class, and spends time to make sure you understand the course content. He is not the easiest grader, but get over it because you're in college and life is hard. Do what is assigned, ask questions, stay engaged, and you will do well in this course.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTA2NDg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGT3124","date_posted":"2017-05-04 18:03:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"He taught the class as if we have all already taken the course once and have seen the material, when we haven't. Doesn't give any feedback on any of the Homework or the Tests, in other words you get points counted off and have no idea why. No office hours and he will not answer homework questions. he also tried to teach a new concept during final.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjE1MjAz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
