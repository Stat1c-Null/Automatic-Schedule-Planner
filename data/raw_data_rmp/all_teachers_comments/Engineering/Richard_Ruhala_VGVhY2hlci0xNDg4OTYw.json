I took control theory with him and got an A. it's a hard course but he will make sure you understand but have to ask him questions. he is a fair grader and give you a curve if you tell him are showing work. Overall solid professor, he always replied to my emails within 1 hour.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODUyOTI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME3501","date_posted":"2021-03-24 19:05:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Ruhala is an overall great professor, he may not be the most exciting, but is straight to the point. All information that is needed for tests/quizzes comes from his notes and homework.

Pretty straightforward class, just follow the instructions he gives during lecture and turn stuff in on time. Should've been an easy A but I had some late work.

The course material was very interesting and he's pretty good at explaining everything. The homework and tests were a little challenging but he's a pretty fair grader (he curves too). He did take kind of long to grade things. Project instead of final exam.
