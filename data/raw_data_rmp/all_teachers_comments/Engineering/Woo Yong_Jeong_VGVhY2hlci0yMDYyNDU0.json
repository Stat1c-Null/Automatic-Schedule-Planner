Very unclear, grading was fair until the final which was 50x's harder than the rest of the tests. Ended up flunking the final and getting a 69.7 and now having to retake.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjExMzY2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":6,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2016-03-31 09:53:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Jeong seemed fresh out of the bin to me. Taking him for statics was more of a test of how well I could read material as opposed to how well I took notes or payed attention. I never knew when his office hours were or how to contact him. Hopefully I would never be forced to take him again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjA5MjU0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":5,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2016-03-30 11:19:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Avoid taken his class. Quiz material is hard to predict/study for. Too many questions on test compared to the time allowed to take it. Often gets stuck while explaining examples in the book. Almost always goes 5-10 minutes past class time. I'm doing well because I go back and teach myself the material.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjAzMjk2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":6,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2016-02-14 20:33:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Woo teaches the class as if you haven't read the book and explains stuff pretty well.  English isn't his first language, but he isn't difficult to understand.  His tests and quizzes aren't that difficult and he allowed us to correct the tests for half of the points back.  If you pay attention in class and do the homework it should be an easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDU1NjUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":8,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2015-11-10 22:18:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Avoid taking him. Terrible English. Often gets stuck explaining example problems and sits there for 10 minutes trying to understand it. Clearly has no grasp of the material. Tests are out of left field and don't cover what he tries to teach in class. Basically learning this stuff on my own thanks to YouTube.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mzg2NDM1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":7,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
