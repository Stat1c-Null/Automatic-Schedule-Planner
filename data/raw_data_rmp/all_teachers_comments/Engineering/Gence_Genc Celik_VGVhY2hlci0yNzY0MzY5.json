She cares about her students, so much so that she basically learned everyone's names by the second class. We had 3 homework assignments, two tests and a final. She also allowed us to have 3 full size, back and front notes sheet for the 2 tests but not the final (because its a department final).","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzMxNTE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3345","date_posted":"2024-04-18 16:36:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"GG is a really good professor. Does her best to make all topics are understood and that labs are informative while also pretty easy and fun to do. Gives very little assignments and hates giving out bad grade so as long as you put effort into work / labs , you will be fine. Would 100% take her again if I could.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjAyMzUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3132","date_posted":"2024-02-08 02:20:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really enthusiastic professor.

She is one of the sweetest professors I've met, and her strengths lab is incredibly easy. You do write group lab reports, so do choose a good group. Her grading is very lenient though, so the papers were super easy. She's also great at explaining theory before the lab!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzM2NDQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2022-05-13 03:04:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor. Her teaching style matched my learning style. I know from other students that it is not for everyone. She gives a lot of extra credit for in-class participation, not just attendance. She teaches from slides from a textbook which she cannot give to the students due to some copyright stuff, so it is key that you go to class.

Her powerpoints are from the textbook so you can't access them, so in a way attendance is mandatory. She's easy going. Her exams are problem based so you have to do calculations to get the answer. The exams have 4 questions. You're allowed one cheat sheet. In conclusion, make sure to know your stuff.
