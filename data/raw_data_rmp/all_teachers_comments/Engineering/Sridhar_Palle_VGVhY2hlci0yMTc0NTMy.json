He teaches great and its obvious he genuinely cares about his students. Grades in Dynamics came from HW,  2 midterms and a final. He is extremely reasonable with the difficultly and wants you to learn the concepts. An A is very doable here. Cant recommend enough.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODg2MDM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENRG3122","date_posted":"2018-10-05 12:13:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"The best instructor anyone can ever think of.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTQ1ODk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?

Dr. Palle is a good guy & I respect him, but the class itself is a joke. Attendance is 30% of the grade. The questions are absurdly easy. There is no real material to learn. It's a freshman seminar course for engineering majors. If you actually want to learn about Mech Eng, do not take this course.

If you take this class, take it in the fall; that's when the big project is the traditional pumpkin launch. Palle is a nice guy, but his lectures can get repetitive and boring. He talks a lot about car airbags.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDYwNDc3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"GROUP PROJECTS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
