She walks through several examples. Quizzes are slightly changed HW problems. Tests are not bad if you do and understand the homework. Honestly, she is one of the most caring professors I know and has tons of side stories that make the class not so mundane!! Strongly recommend.

She kind of expects you to be familiar with the material before you get to lecture, and she spends the class more or less guiding students through the problems. It felt inefficient to me and I was constantly losing my train of thought during class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjc1Mjkz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGR3122","date_posted":"2020-05-11 19:09:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"A very good professor. She learns everyone's names day one. She lectures well and works examples in class. She is very available outside of class. She grades very quickly with great feedback. Her grading is pretty easy and very generous as long as you are on the right track. She is definitely a top notch professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjY0OTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3122","date_posted":"2020-04-27 20:07:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you want a professor to take Dynamics with, this is the one. I feared this class, hearing how much people struggled with it, but she made the process a piece of cake, even during the whole virus situation. The grade was based off of 3 tests worth 40%, 4 quizzes worth 25%, homework worth 15%, and a final worth 20%.

Perfect explanations of problems, always answers any questions you have. 4 quizzes, 3 tests, we had HW due every time we had a quiz or test, it helps to complete the HW.
