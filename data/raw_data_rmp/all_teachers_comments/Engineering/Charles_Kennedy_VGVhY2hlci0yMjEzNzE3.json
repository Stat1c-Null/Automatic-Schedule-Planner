As long as you keep up on the Tooling-U and pay attention in class, and you'll do fine. His lab quizzes are kind of hard cause you have to remember everything he ever says during welding lab. He also LOVES group projects, so be sure to get a good group who aren't lazy.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njk0NDc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
