Final is the exact same questions he sends through an email but you need to search for the answers yourself.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzIxMDI3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG1211","date_posted":"2025-05-01 23:25:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class could of went smoother but some of the instructions were not clear. It took him up to 7 days to respond to emails. His syllubus did not have his office hours nor his phone number if you needed to call to get help. He was lenient on the grading and he still took late work. The tutoring sessions were limited.

You will get a response, but do not bet on a quick response. Using the textbook & watching Youtube tutorials will be the way to pass this course.

Class layout for homework/info isn't the absolute greatest but it's definitely good enough. Homework was usually due on Monday's which threw me off a few times, and late assignments are not accepted. Drawings are time consuming but that's EDG, easy grader though. Good Solidworks tutorials.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTA0MjI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG1211","date_posted":"2021-05-07 15:04:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Can't say good enough things about Derek, you can tell he actually cares about teaching and enjoys it.

Basically self study. He doesn't test you on specific topics, only drawing. When you get to using solidworks, the class becomes very easy. He gives good feedback on drawings and has really good step by step drawing tutorials. I still don't even know what they guy looks like.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzEwNzYz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
