There wasn't much of a clear direction on how to prepare for exams but they weren't hard if you came to class. Also being bombared with several tests in the span of a month really didn't help most of us with heavier courseloads. Somewhat hard to understand and even messes up information.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjQ3OTk3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME3101","date_posted":"2024-11-21 22:09:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"I didn't mind taking him at all, It was basically a free A.

What we learn in the class does not make sense and it is the professor's fault. He just babbles on reading powerpoints and will randomly say \"ahh so simple\". He one got his own question wrong and tried to play it off like he was tricking us. Please take any other professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NzAxNTU3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
