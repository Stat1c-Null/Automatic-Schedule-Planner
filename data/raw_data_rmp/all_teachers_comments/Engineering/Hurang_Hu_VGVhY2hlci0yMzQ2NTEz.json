TBH I think he cares about his students and he's very generous with moving hw due dates etc. but don't expect to learn much from his lectures. Just use MATLAB's online resources and you should be okay.

Bad at explaining things and is hard to follow, yet makes attendance mandatory (1% off final grade per day).\n\nAwful class pacing; midterm exam worth 25% was held after withdrawal day. Final was worth 30%.\n\nConsider waiting a semester if he's the only open slot (I'm begging you).","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODU0NTcy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME1311","date_posted":"2022-10-26 01:32:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Contrary to everything else that has been said about Professor Hu, I thoroughly enjoyed his class.

He NEVER explained anything for assignments, would get mad at us for asking questions and getting bad grades. Never graded anything and only works the easy problems in the textbook, gets them wrong, and tells us that the textbook is wrong and to listen to him. Seriously, if you want a horrible time then take this guy.

At least for Materials Science and Engineering specifically. I've not had him for any other courses. He reads straight off of the slides, but still requires attendance, so the lecture seems pointless.
