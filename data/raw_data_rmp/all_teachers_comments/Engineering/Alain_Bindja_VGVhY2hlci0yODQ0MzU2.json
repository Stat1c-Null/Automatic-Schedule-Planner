If you just do the lab reports correctly you will get a good grade. Just show up and do the work. Only con is he expects you to come to lab knowing everything so he just sets you loose in lab. Everything else is a standard fluids lab.

I don't write reviews to avoid falsely representing a professor. Professor Bindja is an exception. Every small mistake on Labs cost you a letter grade. Exams are unfinishable, and pop quizzes are impossible. good luck getting an A. He also makes a habit of degrading students in class. If you are signed up for his Class DROP IT.

Changed grading criteria without notice, formulas were not given for labs, labs worth 70%, does not tell you why something is incorrect, tests were redoing entire labs, gives 0 if you miss lab even if you tell him ahead of time, tried to schedule final during break. He enjoys having students beg to him.

Grades reports out of 10 so its nearly impossible to get an A unless you are perfect on the uncurved midterm and final which have nothing to do with what you discuss in the lab. Literally take anyone else. the equipment for half the labs didn't work but he'd criticize our reports for in accuracies even though we didnt do the lab","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDkwNjIz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR-3132","date_posted":"2022-11-20 04:00:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Labs are graded upon unclear directions, tests had many questions that were hard to understand (not due to content, due to how it was written), no curve, seemingly impossible to get an A with his incompetence. Quick to take points away with no extra credit or good explanation. Disorganized and bad at explaining expectations.

This makes it very hard to do well. For the midterm and final he posts a drop box to turn them in but wont email you the pdf of questions until after 6:00pm and makes it due at 9, so if you have work, good luck. He seems nice, but very disorganized.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODMxMDM2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
