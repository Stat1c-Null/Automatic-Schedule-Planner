He also waits until the last week to grade anything. It was awful. I didn't know what my grade was until finals week. But, since he took forever to grade things, he reopened all the assignments for us to redo if we wanted. Make sure your drawings are correct. He is a harsh grader. His lectures are worthless, only reads slides","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDkxNTQ4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG1211","date_posted":"2024-11-21 01:03:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"good teacher and wants the students to know SolidWorks and hand drawing. The only thing is he takes FOREVER to grade, so don't expect to get ur grade till the end of the semester and he's a harsh grader. you will have quizzes, midterm but there mostly definitions, not Solidwork or hand-drawn, which sucks.

His lectures were wonderful and it seemed as though he genuinely just wanted to have us learn SOLIDWORKS. Always seemed willing to help students whether it be during office hours or in class, but like I said, his grading is kinda tough.

He is a nice guy but can go too much into detail. Spends a lot of time on hand drawings and looks for things very specifically. Very particular on what is being graded. Available and able to answer any questions pretty well.
