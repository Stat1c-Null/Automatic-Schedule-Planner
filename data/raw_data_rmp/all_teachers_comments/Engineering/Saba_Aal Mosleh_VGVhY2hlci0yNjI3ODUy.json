She isn't accessible outside of class and we never had a reliable schedule to begin with. This was meant to be an in person lab and our first in person lab took place three weeks before the end of the semester. She also doesn't look at your lab reports and just gives Bs and no feedback","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTc3NjEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
