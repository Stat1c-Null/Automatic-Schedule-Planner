While he wants everyone to pass and make a good grade, he also wants you to actually learn the material. It isn't hard as long as you apply yourself and try to learn. He is always available to answer questions and help you to understand the material further than just lecturing.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMTA3OTk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3040","date_posted":"2019-06-26 21:56:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Eric knows his stuff. He is very qualified. You have to participate to do well in this class. It isnt hard. He tells you everything that will be on the test. But its a class that you need to pay attention in. You have to watch him do stuff on the computer, and then he will let you replicate it with an in class assignment.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMDYwODM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?
