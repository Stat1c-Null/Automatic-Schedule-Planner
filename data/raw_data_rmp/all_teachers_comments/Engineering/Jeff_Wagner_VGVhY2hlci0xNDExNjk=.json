You'll forget your question by time he calls on you. So make sure to recorded it because this guy is almost impossible to meet outside class.

He is great! Love him! A little long-winded and will waste a class if he gets off on a story, but he explains everything so well you shouldn't worry. The material is not easy, but he is willing to help until you understand. The tests are not a walk in, laugh it off test. STUDY! You'll be ok. I studied.

Labs are fun and informative, but write-ups are a pain.  He has past tests available for you to work on, but it's a tossup on whether or not they'll be anything like the real thing.

Just when you think you don't understand what the F he is talking about. He has managed to explain it 15 times before you can ask the question.
