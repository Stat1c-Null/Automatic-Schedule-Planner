He never has any clear instructions or grading criteria, and while he does respond to emails quickly, they are often of little help. Quizzes are graded subjectively and with no explanation.

To me, class is dis-organized in D2L everything from numerous semesters put in at once. I got the feeling he did not put in as much work as he could for this very important class, who knows he could be behind the scenes doing stuff, but I doubt it.

Lecture will be straight from the slides with a tiny bit of outside material. The textbook is horrid and is a chopped up version of another book.

I've had him for two classes, and I do not like his teaching style, which seems to be the census I gather from others as well. He makes tests really hard. It is ESSENTIAL that you put forth effort and sit in the front. Very political when it comes down to final grades.

Tests are really hard, so the class averages are pretty low. If you make a 60, then you're doing well. It's not a big deal, he does a curve at the end. He always assigns a big project in his classes and that's a bigger factor for your grade.
