Explains things well with a clear structure, so I came away feeling like I had a solid understanding of the material. Tests are 80% of the grade and he made the first one more difficult than homework/examples w/ missing information, so he had to offer a bunch of extra credit to compensate. Had about a 50% response rate on my emails.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjIzNzAz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
