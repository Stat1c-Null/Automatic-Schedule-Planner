She's assessable outside of class and is willing to work with you. If you try, you will get an A. Just note for ISYE 4250, there is a book you have to read and be tested on at the end of the semester.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODczMzQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3325","date_posted":"2022-05-05 14:33:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor who makes this class a breeze. She is very flexible/accessible and lectures are good. HW/Quizzes seem fairly easy and also provide feedback on how to correctly solve. Tests align with material presented and you have an option to take online/in-person. Do not need to attend lectures to do well. I would 100% recommend.
