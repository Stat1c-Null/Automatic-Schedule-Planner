I was in his office all the time asking him questions and getting help. He was always very knowledgeable. There were online quizzes. occasional homework, and tests. Be aware that you will have to work very hard for an A. He gave like 7 A's out to a class 50.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzIzODY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISYE3801","date_posted":"2020-09-22 16:43:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was not a good professor at all. Rambles the entire class regarding just the math concepts with not much context to how it applies to theory. If you try to get help from him to try to understand something better, he loses his patience immediately and gives you a condescending attitude. Avoid if possible for sure, not a helpful professor at all","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjU2NzM2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ISYE3801","date_posted":"2020-06-18 11:04:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"I'm a studious person and not typically one to leave negative reviews, but I would recommend avoiding this professor. He has a very condescending attitude, he rarely replied to emails, and he dropped a major group assignment on us and gave us only a few days to complete it, then he took over two months to grade it. Super tough grader too.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNDQ1NDA1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ISYE3801","date_posted":"2020-03-20 17:55:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Coates is really cool, but be advised Aerodynamics is kind of an intense course. The material can be a little abstract and hard to keep up with but he really goes the extra mile to make sure you get it. If you don't understand, email him and go by his office and he'll make sure that you get it before you leave.

He was very inspirational. He stressed to us that getting an answer in a box was not nearly as important as understanding the process of what you're doing. Lectures and tests are largely theoretical, lots of derivations etc. If you want to do well, show up and read the book.
