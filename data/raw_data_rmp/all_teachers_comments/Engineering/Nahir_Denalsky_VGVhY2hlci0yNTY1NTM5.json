Professor Denalsky does a good job at mixing the in-person and online classes and is attentive. She is certainly caring and a good teacher by using simple examples and wonderful explanation techniques. Once you get used to her slight accent you will do great.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MzI1Njg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET3424","date_posted":"2020-12-04 00:49:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Denalsky is a great teacher.
