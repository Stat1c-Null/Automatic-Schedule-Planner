This teacher basically makes you learn by yourself. The class is an easy A, but you don't learn anything. She always showed up at least 10 minutes late to class and would leave occasionally while we were working from the textbooks to go play phone games in her car. Her tests are all true and false (but they're easy). Overall easy but annoying.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzI3MzU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG2160","date_posted":"2022-01-14 03:54:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"She shows up late, is hard to contact outside of class, does not respond to emails. Helpful in class. Easy A most quizzes and tests are multiple-choice and straight from the PowerPoints. Some are auto- CAD drawings.

You just work straight out of the textbook, but should be done to do well on the final. Final was open textbook and works in AutoCAD.

She has a moderately thick accent, so sit in the front if you need to. You will need A Practical Guide to AutoCAD Civil 3D and a basic drafting kit+paper. She will help when asked, but most of the class is just working through the book. The quizzes are so easy (online+open book) as well as the tests.
