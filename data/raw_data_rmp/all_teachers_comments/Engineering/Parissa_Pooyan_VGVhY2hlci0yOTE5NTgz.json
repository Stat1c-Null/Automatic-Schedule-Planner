Everything is always open note, and it can be hard to stay motivated when there aren't things you HAVE to study for. tends to be a pattern in IET classes. I wish sometimes it was more difficult so I was forced to learn what im paying for. but I of course love an easy class/A","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTk0Njg2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISYE4250","date_posted":"2025-05-07 01:55:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Pooyan cares a lot about participating.  You basically start with an A and have to try to lose it. Show up for class and be involved in the discussion.  The material isn't that complicated, and your grade comes totally from weekly D2L quizzes and a few exams, all similar.

The group project is very loosely structured with no real rubric, you def have to find a good group early on.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mzk3Mjk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2235","date_posted":"2024-04-25 20:42:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"She wasn't the most warm person. Her tests are not lockdown which is nice. There are 4 HW, 10 quizzes, and 4 exams. The exams are super weird. I think if I would have spent more time on this class I could have done better. I would not recommend this class to anyone, but if you had to take this class be prepared for little work worth a lot  ","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjY5NTM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET3424","date_posted":"2023-07-12 16:02:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Pooyan is funny and responsive. All HW assignments are available as Word docs so you can do the work and then provide the answers through quiz format in D2L. All HW, quizzes, and Exams are open note and open book!
