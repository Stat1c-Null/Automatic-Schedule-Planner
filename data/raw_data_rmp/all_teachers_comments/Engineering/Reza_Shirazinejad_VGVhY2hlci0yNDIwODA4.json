He reads straight from slides, more than once he was blatantly teaching something incorrectly, so why even bother listening? Had to teach myself everything. On top of that he does not go out of his way to help students out.

You could miss a tiny detail in a question and get no credit. His handwriting and organizational skills need major work and he does not explain things in multiple ways. When there is a question, he often gives no explanation and no time to explain confusions in class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDU5MzY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He does not understand what he is teaching so he can barely explain it to those he is trying to teaching.
