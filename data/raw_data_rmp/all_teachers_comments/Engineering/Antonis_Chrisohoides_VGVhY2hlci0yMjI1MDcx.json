He sometimes doesn't explain things well and just gives homework about stuff you don't really know yet. I had him for a basic civil graphics (AutoCAD) so I was okay but I imagine if the class had been a higher level class it would have been very difficult because this one was not easy.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDE5MDEz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Tests?

His homework assignments are graded harshly. He has never been to his office hours on time, and he is late to class 10+min, I have an A in the class, but you are not me. I study every day. The class average on tests is not given, mainly because it would prove his teaching method is whats really failing everyone.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDE0MzY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":11,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2017-02-16 20:56:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Terrible teacher, even worse grading system. 3 tests worth 15% each, 25% on the final, and 30% homework/quizzes. 5 Questions per test, the most difficult in the book.

I dont care if you have to wait until next semester, this is a fair warning. He is a complete waste of time. His classes are delayed, mainly because he shows up late, and after taking attendance (very slowly) you have 2/3rds the class time you started with. His grading is unfair, and he takes up one of 20 problems, and only grades that","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODI4MDQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":15,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2017-01-12 12:52:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is not a good professor if you need Statics for upper level courses. He doesn't teach enough. if the class is 1 hr 15 mins long he will let u take the test only 40-45 mins. Show up late, not prepared, does not answer students have questions. doesn't do problems on board. No extra credits, and unfair with grading.
