She gives a lot of work, but gives you ample opportunity to pass her classes. She will work with you and extend deadlines if you missed work. She truly wants you to know the work. Once in a while, she gets tough on grading. She prepares you to graduate level writing. She's by far the most flexible and caring professor.
