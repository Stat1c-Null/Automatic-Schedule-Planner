We were taught by a TA that was pretty good himself, but no guarantee that he'll stick around. The actual professor never showed up, nor responded to emails.

Grade consisted of 4 exams and D2L quizzes each week.  No homework but to do well on the exams all the class examples and suggested book problems should be thoroughly understood.  By the end of the course you will be well prepared for the Geotech section on FE Exam.  Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTI0ODg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Respected--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2023-07-27 14:54:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best online class I have taken. I got a D in my last SOM class because the lectures were actually useless and we had no example problems. So I took his class online and I was able to learn and teach myself everything with given resources. Quizzes and tests also did not contain questions with content or examples that were not covered.

Worse in online courses since there's less time for tests. His tests are hard and there isn't enough time to complete them.
