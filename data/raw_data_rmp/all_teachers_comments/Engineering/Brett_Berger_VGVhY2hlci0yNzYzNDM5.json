Don't be afraid to ask him for help though, because he'll keep going through his lecture. If you do work, you'll make an A.

The first few weeks have a lot of homework, but once you get into solid works, the difficulty drops. He gave us our quizzes before we actually took it so you knew everything that was going to be asked. He 3-d prints one of your projects and you get to keep it. I honestly don’t know why he isn’t rated better.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTUzOTQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG1211","date_posted":"2022-03-18 17:22:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Students who were new to CAD programs found the class to be terrible but if you have experience with any CAD, you'll be fine. The department's 1211 curriculum has been standardized since the most recent reviews so anything about content doesn't apply.

Class is sometimes working on homework in class or following along with the rest of the class to model a part. Unlike alot of teachers, there is room to do things in a different way that he doesn't teach. As long as you make your models to scale, it's good.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1ODYwMDYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG1211","date_posted":"2022-01-10 21:23:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Terrible.
