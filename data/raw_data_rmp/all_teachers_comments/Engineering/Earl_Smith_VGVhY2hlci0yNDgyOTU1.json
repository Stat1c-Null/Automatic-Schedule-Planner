Did literally nothing but talk about bridges and the wright brothers, literally every single class. He gave nearly the same lecture every class, verbatum.

I mean, I don't know how he got into ksu but jeez. We were not even sure to have a final! Don't take him. Even if you are looking for easy A's, having class woth him is a pain.
