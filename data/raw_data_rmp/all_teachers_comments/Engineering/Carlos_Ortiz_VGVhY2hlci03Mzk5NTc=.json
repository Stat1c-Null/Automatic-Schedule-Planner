It's an Engineering course, this isn't Literature or some pansy Liberal Arts program.  You get out of it what you put into it.

He truly cares about his students and their progress in his classes. I've taken his classes many times. Yes he is tough and expects students to carry their own weight,, but attend class, take good notes, and you won't have a problem.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzI4MDg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CET2110","date_posted":"2011-05-25 00:37:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's really interested in the subject. He doesn't require a textbook and his notes are straight forward. His exams are a little tough. He drops the lowest test grade. My test average was a 60 and I somehow managed to get an A so he probably curves too. Definitely would take him again!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjYwNjUw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CET3344","date_posted":"2010-09-02 18:22:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher! Explains the material very well; however, test problem require that you not only completely understand the material but can apply it to enviromental problems. The tests involve very simple concepts, you just have to understand the material and how to apply it.

His test are extremely difficult, but not impossible to get an A in.
