Her exams aren't that difficult as they are often just variations of problems from the textbook or class. Lectures can be a bit unorganized as she isn't the best with technology though, so it's best to read up prior to class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjQ4MzQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EE-2301","date_posted":"2023-09-28 15:43:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"She gives out SO much unrealistic work that resembles NOTHING that she does in class. This class probably takes me 4-5 hours outside of class just to complete all the work. She gives out tests that she may or may not even know the answers to and is a very tough grader. Avoid her if you wish to have any time for anything else.

I have liked few professors as people as much as I liked her, but MAN her class was hard. Definitely read the material before lecture, even if you never do that for other classes.
