He works in the field full-time so he relates everything in lab to the real world. The lab reports are long, but he is available to answer questions if you get stuck. He is easy going, but you have to earn your grade.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDY5Nzg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3343","date_posted":"2017-03-23 18:06:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took professor Moss for Fluids. He is a very real world professor and brings a lot of it to the classroom. He is a new professor, so he has a couple things to work through. His material is thin, but his brain is big. Pay attention in class to succeed. Make sure to stay on top of the base material, there are pop quizzes on simple comprehension.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTQwMTAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
