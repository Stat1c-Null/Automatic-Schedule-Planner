He is a figure of the Nuclear field and has inspired some many students to pursue that field. If you have the chance to take him take it. Truly deserves all the credit for the KSU Nuclear minor. Wish I could have taken more classes with him. KSU didnt deserve a man so amazing.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDU3NjE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Skip class?

Dr. Ghavi clearly has a passion for the topic and makes the material very approachable. Textbooks would be beneficial, but good notes and attendance can get you through the course.
