Great professor, 1 of the best I have encountered at SPSU so far.  His tests are ok, however his grading is his major flaw. Quizzes make up 45% of your grade & the final could hurt you. Don't make mistakes on them, at least not often, that is key to even ensure passing his classes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MDE5MzY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ELECT2300","date_posted":"2010-10-21 17:41:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good Teacher","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Njc5ODk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECET2300","date_posted":"2009-11-16 18:05:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful prof.

Summer = easy.  Fall = toss-up.  He isn't really that hard, but his tests will kill you.  He doesn't give partial credit, so if you tend to make simple mistakes, they will be major mistakes here.
