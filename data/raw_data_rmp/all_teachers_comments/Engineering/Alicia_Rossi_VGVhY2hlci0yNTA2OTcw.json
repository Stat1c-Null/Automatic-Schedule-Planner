I never learned from the lecture, only from the book. Her test 2 average was a 51 because she based it on practice problems modified into the test questions, so if you didn't do the practice, you failed. The practice problems were given to us a week after the test, and the test problems did not resemble coursework.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTUxNDE4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Get ready to read--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ME1311","date_posted":"2021-01-12 21:15:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was 'OK'. Class was boring, and monotone. She uses teams and records so you can review as needed. She does have a daily attendance problem so attendance is mandatory.

She gives videos to watch every week to understand the program well, and also goes over the concepts in class to give a clear understanding of the program. However, the student must pay attention in class to learn the program well and to do good on tests.

She thought it was best to make this class partially-asynchronous, which means learn everything on your own time, and do 4 practice problems the whole class.
