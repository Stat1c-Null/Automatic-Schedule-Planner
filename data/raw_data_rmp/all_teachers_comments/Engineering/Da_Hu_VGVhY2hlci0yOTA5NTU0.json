Lectures are boring, but the homework is similar to the powerpoints, and the tests are similar to the homework. So as long as you study the homework, you will get an A on the test. Some test questions are directly from the homework. He is very nice and cares a lot about his students.

He will set aside time to meet with the student to offers extra help/credit if needed. A very understanding and good professor.

He added an extra test because a lot of people didn't do well on the first one. The tests were all examples from the slides and he reviews the class before the test. The homework was easy and from the slides. No quizzes. Always willing to help and answer questions. Responds quickly to emails.
