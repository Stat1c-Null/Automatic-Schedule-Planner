There are fairly limited options at KSU, and I believe that he is probably the best. You will most likely fail the exams, but he provides a curve.

This class relies heavily on knowledge from statics, but you get a 2 week review. Drops the lowest test grade and the 2nd lowest can be replaced by final.

While Jeff Hanson on YT is your friend, Dr. Kaplan teaches very visually and a little different! He's a nice dude, and will curve your exams and final like CRAZY.
