His class is easy if you do his in class examples. Additionally, he will go out of his way to help you if you have anything come up during the semester.

He did a great job teaching us how to apply simulation results to real world applications and apply what we learned in Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer.

Laid out the course materials in a very easy, straightforward, and clear way. Made a challenging course material feel somewhat relaxed. Some instances of being tested on concepts before the homeworks on them were due. Maybe something came up for him that caused this scheduling, but it was odd nonetheless.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjE4NTE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME4250","date_posted":"2021-03-24 19:13:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"By far one of the best professors I have taken in KSU.

The only thing that makes the class difficult is the implementation of previously learned Laplace transforms, which I personally didn't have a good foundation of, but Prasad even made that part of the class easy to understand. Would recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzQ5Nzg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

Starts with the basics in SolidWorks to teach how to properly run FEA simulations for one half of the semester, then Flow simulations in the second half.
