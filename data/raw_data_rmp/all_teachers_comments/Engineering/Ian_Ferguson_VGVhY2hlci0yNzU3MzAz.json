The class was not difficult at all; however, there is a lot of reading that you need to do to complete your assignments. The prof is quite passionate about helping students to move forward, not only in class, but mostly outside of it. Every topic was geared towards using the info outside class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTgyODIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
