If you're looking for an easy grade this is your guy. However, if you actually care about the material I wouldn't take him. You're pretty much on your own.

He expected us to understand perfectly after he stumbled through one example. The good thing was that he threw out a lot of grades or gave make up assignments. However, in doing this no one really got to learn anything. Do not take him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MDIyOTA1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET4326","date_posted":"2008-01-17 14:37:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class is not always exciting, but you will learn if you pay attention.

We go over one example in class and the entire test is over that one example, not clear at all in notes or what is expected on tests, if he is not mocking you he is saying something condescending to the class. Does give lots of extra credit though.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNjkyOTIz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ATET","date_posted":"2003-10-30 22:18:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher, easy A if u do ur work... he lets u make up some tests and lets u drop a grade.
