However, I will say that this course wasn't hard for me. If you do your work for the first month, then the rest of the course will fall into place.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTQ4NzI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET2449","date_posted":"2025-04-24 13:31:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class was the most stressful of my course load. I tried emailing her a few times, and only got a response a week before the end of semester. She expects your face and hands to show during a test, which is near impossible with a laptop. The lecture tries to cover too many topics at once, making it overwhelming and hard to follow.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDI4MTQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3325","date_posted":"2025-04-20 02:55:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"requires a web cam. For the record, I have always been an online student, and none of my professors have ever required something so silly. I do not live close enough to library to check out a web cam, nor do I have time to go after my fulltime job. I also don't have the money to spend on a webcam.

Even though the content isn't super difficult to begin with.

She made this semester way more extra than it had to be all because she doesn't want people to cheat like she held our grades because our lockdown browser environments wasn't what she wanted. Like???
