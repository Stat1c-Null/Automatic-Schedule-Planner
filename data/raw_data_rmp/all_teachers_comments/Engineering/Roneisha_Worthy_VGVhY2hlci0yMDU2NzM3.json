She has such a great personality and is very passionate about the subject. She basically gives you an \"A\". She does assign homework, but it's not a lot. Test pretty much come straight from the homework. She is willing to help anyone who needs it. I would defiantly recommend taking her if you get the chance.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzUxMzA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2016-03-10 00:56:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"She took the class step-by-step through the material so you never felt lost.  She took attendance but got pretty lenient on it at the end of the semester.  Tests and quizzes are easy if you do the homework (it's not a lot of homework).  And she's very welcoming if you ask questions during class, at her office, or even call her on the phone.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTMwMTcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2015-11-03 08:42:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hands down one of the best professors I've ever had. She's very clear and breaks down material into simple and easy to understand concepts. If you don't understand something, she'll take time and explain it in class or at her office during hours. She's super understanding and wants you to do well in her class. Plus, a bonus is she's pretty funny.
