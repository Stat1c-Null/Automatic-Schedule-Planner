Had a hard time communicating what he wanted for assignments & tests until after the fact. He had a hard time making up his mind and ended up changing a lot during the course of the class. Nice person to talk to, but not a great professor tbh.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NzM1NzI2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SYE2100Z","date_posted":"2015-11-10 17:57:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"He goes off on tangents and doesn't always make any sense. You get bad grades on assignments, then have them reassigned to demonstrate iterative engineering. Nice guy, knows his stuff, just can't teach.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzgzODU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
