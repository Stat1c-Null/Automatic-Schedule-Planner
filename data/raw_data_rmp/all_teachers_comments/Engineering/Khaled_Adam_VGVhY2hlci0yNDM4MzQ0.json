Attendance is taken every class but he reads directly off of the slides. When asked questions he takes the most round about way to not answer the question. His monotone voice will probably put you to sleep if haven't already gotten loss from his over complicated explanations.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTA4MjEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

I do not recommend to anyone unless you like teaching yourself an entire course. He is unprepared for class. It seems like he is reading the lecture's PPT and notes for the first time. He is bad at doing examples. He will avoid your questions. We often left class even more confused and frustrated than when we entered.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTE1MDE5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
