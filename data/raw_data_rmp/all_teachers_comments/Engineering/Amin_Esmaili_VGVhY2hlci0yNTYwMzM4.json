Show up to his live lectures and exam review sessions (easy 4 points extra credit), do the homework and youll be fine. I didnt study much and still made an A. The class was low stress. Many students did well. Will definitely take him again if I can.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTgxNTU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISYE3100","date_posted":"2021-05-06 18:00:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Esmaili was ok. His lectures were very boring and I never really learned anything from him because he is all over the place. I get the impression that he doesn't really know the material for his courses very well. Tests weren't bad if you study. Lot's of homework (especially last minute assignments given). Easy A in general","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzIzOTYz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET4135","date_posted":"2020-07-07 15:11:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do NOT take this teacher. He does not set you up for success in his class. His notes and lecture are all over the place with no flow, making it very confusing. Then for assignments instructions are vague and he does not clearly define what he wants you to turn in. Say not to worry about things on assignments since he grades easy, then takes points.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNDkwMzY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ISYE3125","date_posted":"2020-05-01 04:37:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Esmaeili honestly shocked me, I expected worse. You have a quiz each class but they are online. One thing that I hated was that he would assign homework before he taught us the topic, and would go over it after. Also unorganized and would make up examples and confusing at times; overall you really need to work hard in his class for an A","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTczOTMx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Beware of pop quizzes--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SYE6020","date_posted":"2020-03-02 02:39:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"He need to update his supper lagging internet, images showed in the lecture couldn't catch up with his voice.
