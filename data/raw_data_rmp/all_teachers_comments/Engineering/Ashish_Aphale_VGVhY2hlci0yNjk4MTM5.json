The final project, my group mates did not preform to standard in the slightest, I went to him and he was incredibly understanding of the whole situation. Would definitely take again. Dr. Aphale is great, would definitely recommend!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTg3NTg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME3440","date_posted":"2024-12-24 15:27:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ashish Aphale is very nice and is always willing to help you understand problems.

If you do and understand the HW you shouldn't struggle on the quizzes or tests. Quizzes and tests are open note but don't expect that to let you off the for not doing or chegging the HW. Relying on notes for quizzes and tests, you will run out of time searching through notes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODA4NTI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ME3440","date_posted":"2022-12-13 21:22:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely fantastic professor.

I'd recommend him for any class that he teaches. Extremely knowledgeable but still approachable. 8 labs and 6 quizzes. Quizzes were easy (10 MC) and labs were pretty straightforward. He was very open about answering questions and lenient on deadlines.
