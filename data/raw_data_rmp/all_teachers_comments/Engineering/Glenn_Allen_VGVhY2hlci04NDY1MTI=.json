He truly cares about his students academic progress, as well as their overall well-being. Probably the best teacher that I have encountered so far.

One of the few people at Southern Poly that understands the needs of students and recognizes why we are getting an education in the first place. Has a good vision for the school. As far as the EG class goes, it was easy and i learned what i was supposed to. I was kinda disappointed it didn't go into more depth.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NDE2NzM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MTRE1000","date_posted":"2007-11-02 00:53:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good educator, very smart, professional attitude, enthusiastic, able to help, exigent (fair), good attitude.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTg4Mjk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MET1000","date_posted":"2006-12-05 18:12:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this class!
