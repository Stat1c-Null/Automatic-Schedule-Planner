There's a homework assignment every week, three quizzes that vary in difficulty, and the department-wide final. He does his best to prepare you for every assignment and really cares that you succeed. Definitely take him if you can!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDUxNDkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Gives good feedback--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG1211","date_posted":"2020-03-14 01:09:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Prof. Mishoe for engineering graphics and he was great. He was extremely nice and very interactive. Very receptive of questions and even challenging his opinion. Always graded very fairly and was always available for help and troubleshooting.

I took him for ENGR graphiscs. He really shows compassion for his students, offering multiple extra credit opportunities including dropping the lowest assignment grade. I like the fact that he can humanize the material, making it easy comprehend. I learned a lot in his class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTg0NjQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDG1211","date_posted":"2018-05-02 13:48:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing professor!
