Knows his stuff. To pass his class, you have to be willing to learn at his pace. He requires class room participation.

By rights, I should have gotten an F in 4001, all the tests are open book. The only thing determining whether you pass is whether you understand the material. And it's not that hard. It's basicaly fun ODE","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjc1MTgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

The slides in lecture is literally the textbook copied. He does examples already solved in the textbook during lecture and his homework is from textbook. So if you follow along with the textbook and solve problems from it you should pass easily. Con: He takes attendance and takes away point for absence.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTI0MTUy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

His lectures are meaningless and have nothing to do with the actual MTRE curriculum. Usually late, harsh grader for some people, his assignments are busy work and are almost always due at random times (such as at 2:06 AM) without warning. A complete waste of my time.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzE5OTUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
