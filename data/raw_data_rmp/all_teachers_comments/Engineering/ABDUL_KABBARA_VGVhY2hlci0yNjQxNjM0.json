He was late majority of the time and gave smart remarks to questions asked. I would not recommend him at all, he should not be teaching he obviously does it for the money and not because he enjoys helping students learn.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTkwNjYy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3501","date_posted":"2025-08-12 18:35:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"1.

The professor was consistently late to class and relied entirely on reading directly from the PowerPoint slides with little added explanation. When going over test problems, they frequently made mistakes, which only added to the confusion. Communication was poor emails often went unanswered.\n","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTEwMDc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2023-11-06 23:39:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Strength of Materials Lab: Each lab session would have some error or issue that would cause the data recorded to be wrong.

Test study guides also did not show how problems were solved, only had answers. Taught myself everything using Chegg and the internet.
