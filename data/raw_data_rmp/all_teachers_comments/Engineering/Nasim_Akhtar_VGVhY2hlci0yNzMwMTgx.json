His lectures don't make sense and if you ask him questions, he won't explain properly. No proper office hours. No clear communication and students have to predict when Hws and exams are due. The class started out with 20 students and ended with 13.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTI0ODU3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2022-09-28 19:47:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you want to keep your sanity do not take this professor. I took him for Strength of Materials Lab and you can follow the guidelines he sets out 110% and he will still take 10-20 points off for \"material that is missing\" when most of the time it is not. He is not helpful in solving problems if you have issues with your group.

He listens to the class and makes decisions based on what the students want. I would recommend if you want a stress free class. He does ramble a bit, but he is extremely smart and loves teaching.

Cannot understand simple things such as D2L. Gives random students &quot;grace points&quot; because he feels like it. Grades students differently even though they made the same mistakes.

Will tell you something is not going to be on the test, and then will just put it on anyways. Will tell you homework is not due one day and then will just make it due anyways.
