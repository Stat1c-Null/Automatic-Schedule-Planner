He also had a couple of contacts from the real world lecture to the class and offer advice. He will meet with the individual design groups and give constructive feedback on how the team is advancing. Be wary as he often talks beyond the class end time.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDA0MTU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CPE4903","date_posted":"2023-10-19 02:16:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Yiin cares a lot about his students and their success. Neural Networks is hard class but Dr. Yiin does good at describing the material. Its overwhelming at times with new info & words, but once you work through some examples it isn't awful.
