His lectures rely heavily on textbook PPTs, & he lacks confidence in answering questions. Many students dropped the class (from 60 to 48), which is concerning. If you're not proficient in math or want a clear understanding of finance, it's best to take another instructor.

The course consists of roughly 10 quizzes and homework assignments along with three exams and an optional final that replaces all grades lower than it.
