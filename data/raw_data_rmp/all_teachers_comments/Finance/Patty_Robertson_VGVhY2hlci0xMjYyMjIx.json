She breaks up the material into many tests so you don't have to memorize all the material at once.  The book is not needed, but come to class to learn instead.  Study her slides to memorize concepts and generally understand formulas (even though they are usually included on tests).  Do the work and you'll get an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTYwMDA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FIN3100","date_posted":"2009-12-14 22:55:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy class, textbook is not needed. Her powerpoints are self contained.  Attendance is not mandatory but very helpful.  7 exams, drops lowest grade, extra credit built in to every exam.  Sounds like a lot of exams but it helps break up the material and makes the test easier.  No homework or group projects.  I highly recommend her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTU1MTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FIN3100","date_posted":"2009-10-25 14:31:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful teacher! Very helpful and willing to show you how things work. Get a scientific calculator for $20, it will make the class easier due to having so many formulas.
