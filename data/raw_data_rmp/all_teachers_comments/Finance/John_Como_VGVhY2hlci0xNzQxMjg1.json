He does know this stuff, but he def knows finance better.  The testing and homework structure is the same as his finance class.  You have to be there to pass this class.

You have to attend because the homework system will make or break you.  Homework is random and you do not know when it is coming.

Some of the material is just plain dry if you don't enjoy math. However, if you actually do the homework assignments (random pickup) and ask questions, he WILL help and explain better.

He's better at teaching finance, but not bad here.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzIxMDgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FIN3100","date_posted":"2015-04-29 00:21:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"So far he has been clear with email communications and answering questions.
