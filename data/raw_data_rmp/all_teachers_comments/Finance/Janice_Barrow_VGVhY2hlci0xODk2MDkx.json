We only took two test and the final was mainly conceptual concepts that we went over in class for three weeks. I wish the lectures would have been more engaging. Also, wish she would of went over her test before in class. Such as really stressing what key concepts could be on the test.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjk2MDkw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

Mrs. Barrow is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. Her lectures do not match what is on the tests, and she is very disorganized. It got so bad we had to ask the Head of the Finance Dept. to sit in. 0/10 would never take again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjgzNjAx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"FINAN510","date_posted":"2019-12-03 19:33:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very disorganized.

If you have half of a brain, you should get an A. Pack your bags and switch majors if you have to take her because it is not worth the horrific journey. She has a PhD, but does not know how to perform basic tasks on a computer or financial calculator. You would be better off flushing your money down a toilet.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDI0MDEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"450F","date_posted":"2019-05-14 21:05:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am a finance major taking Finance 450 and I was unfortunate enough to have Barrow as my teacher. All she does is sit at the front of the classroom and make a poor-at-best attempt to teach. The tests are very hard and usually involve material that I don't even think she knows how to do.

She's the worst I have ever had (undergrad and grad school). I don't mind working for a grade, but her expectations are ALL OVER THE PLACE and she doesn't grade according to the rubric. How you do on a project is a crap shoot at best. She'll ruin Finance for you.
