I only went to 2 classes and took the final.  His lectures are random and extremely boring.  Get the book, read the chapters, go to test review, and turn in homework.  He is not a good teacher, but easy to pass his classes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNDI1NDY0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FIN3100","date_posted":"2007-05-30 18:07:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shushan is the man.  I took him in the Summer and there is a lot of homework, but it is gone over in class and he keeps class fun by breaking up the subject of finance.  Real smart guy and funny too.  If you want to make an A, have fun, and learn basic fundamentals, take him.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMjI1NzIz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FIN3100","date_posted":"2007-05-07 22:00:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class is very incomprehensible. He does not teach much and talks about everything else. If you want to learn in FIN 3100, I seriously suggest: do not take him. I  looked up previous postings and took him this semester. What a waste of time. I feel I did not learn anything.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMTI1MTQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FIN3100","date_posted":"2006-12-15 11:41:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class lectures are hard to make it through because of his monotone voice and boring personality. He is a nice guy though and wants to see students do well.  We had to do a lot of homework and papers that he took up for grade but it was a major part of our total grade.  Tests are simple, if you know how to do the financial analysis and read the book","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNjEzNjkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FIN3100","date_posted":"2006-08-19 11:24:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Assigns students to read the book but rarely goes over it in class. Knows what he's talking about but at times tends to get off track. I had him for the summer semester, so we only had 1 test throughout the whole term. Questions from test are straight from class discussion. Make sure u know how to do the financial analysis!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMTcxODA4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
