I would recommend studying for the tests though because they can be tough. However, the same questions are on pretty much all of them. He is a pretty easy grader too on your projects so don't sweat them. Don't really need the book other than for the academic integrity statement","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDA0NTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2014-12-06 11:20:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"3 tests, a speech, a group project, and a few book assignments. Very, very easy. Read the book and do your work. Study for the tests, he likes to ask things from both lecture and the text. He is pretty funny, he likes when you get involved in lectures. He's a fair grader, you get what you worked fordeserve.

Love that about him. His first two tests are hard. Don't worry his study guide is the exam word for word, the questions are even in the same order. He gave me a 100 even though I wasn't even close to making it to 7 minutes on my speech. He's a funny guy. Seriously take him, you get out early a lot.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDg4ODgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2013-01-04 21:01:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ridiculously easy class, and quite frankly the material is BS.

Pretty much wanting to hand everyone an A. As long as you do your work he is going to be pretty reasonable with you.  If you are borderline on your final grade he will most likely bump you up.

At the beginning of the semester there's a lot of useless work, but it's easy. He like to discuss about things irrelevant to the class..but then again the class is irrelevant to life.
