He is nice and understanding, but the class and his teaching is EXTREMELY difficult. 6 pop quizzes and 5 exams (drops 1 of each) closed notes, cheat sheet allowed for exam. No study guide given, so if you are not good at teaching yourself, I would stay FAR away from this course. Everything is in person.
