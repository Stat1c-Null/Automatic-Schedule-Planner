He skips steps and doesnt teach concepts, just does one big example the whole class. I had to withdraw and i am a straight A student.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2ODUxOTUy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2009-12-06 22:23:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"although not the most gifted teacher in the world, moody was very responsive to questions and spent a great deal of time with students after lab answering questions. as long as you went to class, you were pretty much guaranteed a A. lab was a free A. he added 20 points to all homework too. if you are not great at physics: TAKE THIS MAN.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDgyMjUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2009-12-04 21:46:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dont risk your gpa!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDczODQ4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2009-11-15 16:23:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's okay, not the best teacher.

He knows his weaknesses, that's why he goes out of his way to help. If you don't do well in his class, then you've done absolutly nothing to correct it. As I said no other teacher will help you as much. Ps. you can actually understand what he's saying.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzAyNjY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2009-10-04 17:18:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is his first year teaching. He expects the students to know EXACTLY what he knows,he does examples on the board & says we dont need to worry about them..well then why are you showing them to us. If you already know alot about physics you'll do good if not take someone else.
