His style of teaching was reading off of the powerpoints that were from Webassign. Accent can be tough sometimes. An abundant amount of Webassign homework that counts as a test at the end, 4 tests, 1 is dropped, and the tests are hard. Tests are based off of recitations and book. Beware of taking him.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDg1NTEy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2212","date_posted":"2016-05-05 14:57:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Guragain was an effective and fair teacher. Tests are hard but reasonable. There are only four tests, one is dropped, and HW counts as a test grade. He provides ample opportunities to help boost your grade. Web assigns are not easy, but help. His recitations are helpful. His tests are based off the book and recitations.

Naturally, the average for that test was a 70: borderline failure. Has a bit of a language barrier, as many of the questions are oddly phrased.  Never admits when he's wrong.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTQ5Nzg3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2212","date_posted":"2016-02-21 18:59:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Don't take. Dull, monotone and boring. does not know how to teach. reads directly from ppts and has a thick accent. Tests are MC and conceptual. crams in material in the last minute. Hw is webassign and there are 4 tests. Drops lowest test. No point in coming to class except for attendance which is taken randomly.
