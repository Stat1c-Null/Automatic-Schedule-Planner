His passion for teaching is undeniable, and, though somewhat unprofessional at times, he does a great job overall.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxODcyMTMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2012-10-17 04:03:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had him for both Physics 1111 Recitation and Lab. He wastes time in recitation by babbling about whatever he wants to discuss and does not help you answer your questions; which is the purpose of that class. In lab he would do the same thing for about an hour or more about random stuff and you would have to try and rush through the lab. DO NOT TAKE!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzA4NDkz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
