He writes everything on the whiteboard and has no accessible notes. His lectures provide maybe 15% of the course material, so prepare to study hours on your own. Also his breakout sessions are miserable. Thankfully, he wants students to do well and has extra credit and grades lightly.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjk3MjA2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS1112L","date_posted":"2020-04-18 02:15:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Unclear grading criteria. Not a real professor. He lectures for most of the lab and expects the class to know how to use oscillators and switchboards. Told us we had to write lab reports &amp; attendance didn't matter as long as your name was on the report. Then switch the rubric 3 weeks in claiming every student had to turn a report in individually.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDgwMzEx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
