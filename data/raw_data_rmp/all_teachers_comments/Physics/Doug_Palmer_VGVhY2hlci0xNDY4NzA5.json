He explains physics so well. There are 2 exams + final.You get to have a cheat sheet. His grading is great. HW is 25% of your grade, labs 15%, exams 20% and final 25%. If you go to class/lab and do the HW, you will definitely pass.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTIyMjY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2010-09-30 14:26:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. palmer is a great teacher. I took this class before with a different prof and failed. I made a B in Dr. palmers class because he explains things much better than other teachers I have had before.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjIzODY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2010-09-21 09:34:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is the best professor I have ever had in college.
