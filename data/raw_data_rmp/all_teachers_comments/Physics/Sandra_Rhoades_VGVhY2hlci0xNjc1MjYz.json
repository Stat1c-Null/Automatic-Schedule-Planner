If you question her midthought, you will not get a clear answer, but if you wait until she has explained something thoroughly and is just about to move on to ask your question, then you will get a rather good answer. Also, reading the book is imperative. Overall, a fun and informative class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTk4NzIx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2012-05-02 21:36:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst college professor I've ever had. Rambles a ton, examples not relevant to exams, and insults you if you forget algebra formulas. She's a hs professor too, cares very little for college job obviously.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTgwOTA4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
