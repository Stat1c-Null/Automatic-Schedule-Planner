I took him for dynamics, engineering materials, and machine design. His test aren't easy, but if you do the homework and study from it you'll do well.

I'm a business major and I took Calc based Physics I for the hell of it. The class started off rough, but as I grew accustomed to the tests (and actually started reading the book) I blew the class away.

He is very clear in lecture, works plenty of practice problems and provides many opportunities for help. Also, he sounds and acts like Sheldon Cooper from BBT.
