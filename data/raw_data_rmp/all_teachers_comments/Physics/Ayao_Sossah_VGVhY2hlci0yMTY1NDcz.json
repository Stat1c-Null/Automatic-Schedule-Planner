He has one of the worst language barrier Ive ever had. Luckily hes really nice, the material is easy, and the tests are easy. He will drop your lowest test grade and each study guide is similar to the exam. Nobody dropped this class all semester so take that for what you will.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjIxNzkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2017-12-09 23:31:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed his class. There are 4 exams and a final and he drops your lowest. There is a lot of homework but it's online! His test questions came directly from the recitations and lectures, but mostly recitations. He's always willing to help if you're confused. He also curves and gives partial credit even if your answer is wrong.

Lab was easy. Only 3 tests, drops lowest. Formula sheets provided. Recitation best done in groups. He does have a thick accent and his handwriting can be tricky. Only needed webassign code.
