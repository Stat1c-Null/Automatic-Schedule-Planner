Much more useful in recitations than in lectures. He doesn't explain concepts well in class; highly sporadic and confusing. Most of the stuff is from the textbook so if you can understand the material from there well, you will be okay.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMTQ0NjY5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Graded by few things--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2019-04-25 01:33:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is my second degree, and I can say with confidence this is the WORST professor I've ever seen. Lectures are rambling messes, he forgets to teach problems but then posts mini quizzes that no one understands. He makes fun of people who ask questions, very thick accent, bad attitude. I'd rather delay graduation than take any class of his again","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjY5OTU0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2019-03-20 20:22:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Heavy accent, but a caring guy and wants his students to succeed. GO. TO. RECITATION. He literally went over the test in the recitations and used the same format on the test, just used different values. Took Physics the first time and failed then the second time around about 2 years later made an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDU4MzU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2018-12-13 22:16:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall he was better than I expected. Sometimes his lectures tend to be him showing us how to get a formula, but he has mini ungraded quizzes that are like the test so its worth going. SHOW UP TO THE RECITATIONS. He shows you the steps for problems in there and uses those on the test. He honestly wants you to succeed and understand how to do it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDEzNTM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--TEST HEAVY--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2018-12-11 01:44:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a pretty chill guy if you show up to class, his recitation, and generally keep good contact. He wants you to pass but you need to put forth some effort. He wasn't great for the 1st test, but after seeing everyone do poorly he gave an effort to provide more practice material and change the next tests. Rough accent but you'll get used to it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTU4OTk2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2018-12-11 01:25:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a caring professor, his tests aren't very hard but it's easy to make simple mistakes.

I am a math major and still cannot figure it out. He does not clearly explain any objectives of physics and does not do examples, just theory. One test grade is dropped but good luck passing any of them. I do not recommend at all. Also very hard to understand his accent.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTEyNzQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":9,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2018-09-18 10:52:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He knows about physics, he just does not know how to explain it well enough to teach it.
