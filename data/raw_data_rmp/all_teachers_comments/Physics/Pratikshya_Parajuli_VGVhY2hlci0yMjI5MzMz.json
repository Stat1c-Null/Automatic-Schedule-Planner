She was very clear about what she expected from us and was very fair. When our lab equipment didn't work she helped us out. Messed up my grade once and fixed it right away after an email, very responsive. Accent is definitely manageable.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTcyMTMw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2017-12-18 23:12:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"TAKE HER! She does have a thick accent but her tests are way EASIER compared to the other physic professor that my friends have. Grades: HW, recitation and 3 exams with the lowest one drop + final exam. Lectures are boring but an A is very possible if you do HW and read textbook if confused. Use her office hours she's very helpful one on one!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjY4MDcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Class is was her teaching and no one understanding due to the speed she teaches, the accent and her doing the problems without explaining. However she is really good one on one during the breakout session. She posted the slides online and that's the only reason I passed. She knows her stuff but can't teach it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODIzODQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2017-08-15 19:47:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was an awesome professor! I took her over the summer 2017 and she explained concepts well and definitely went out of her way to make sure people understood, when they actually asked questions. I wish I could take her for physics 2 but she doesn't teach that, yet at least. Homework was webassign, and her tests and final were definitely not bad.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NjE2OTg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":5,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2017-01-27 08:45:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice woman but unless you want to teach yourself the material do not take this professor. She reads the power points but doesn't ever walk you through examples or explain what the components of the problems represent. The information she writes on the board is confusing and not helpful. If you take this professor I recommend getting a tutor!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzgxODc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
