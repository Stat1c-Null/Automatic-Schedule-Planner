But he doesn't teach the best, sometimes you won't understand the lectures, and you might get lost. I had to study a pretty good amount on my own time. But go to his office hours, and he will make you understand. Overall still a solid choice","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNDY5NTc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2025-05-25 01:28:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"He evidently knows the material he teaches. But he's not the best at conveying it. He's new so I'll give him that but my experience with him was mediocre. Relied on powerpoints instead of hand-solved problems and struggled to explain several concepts.

Knows his stuff but this past semester was his first time teaching, and he struggled to explain the concepts effectively. Next couple semesters I have faith he'll be better. Took a good bit of Chemistry Tutor to learn some of the things but PHYS 2211 is mainly a straight forward course.

He'll explain the content, and he actually knows how to answer a question. PHYS 2211 is a fairly easy course, and I think the lectures reflect that. He doesn't make attendance mandatory, but naturally, if you don't attend, you won't do well. Weekly homework and a smaller \"breakout assignment\" for weekly one-hour sessions.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjA5ODE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2025-04-29 12:07:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very knowledgeable but his lectures are really bad, he's always rushing and sometimes gets confused while lecturing.

Breakout assignments are graded, but attendance isn't required. The way he lectures isn't that coherent, but he's a very lenient grader. He's willing to adjust the next exam's difficulty if too many students underperformed on the most recent one.
