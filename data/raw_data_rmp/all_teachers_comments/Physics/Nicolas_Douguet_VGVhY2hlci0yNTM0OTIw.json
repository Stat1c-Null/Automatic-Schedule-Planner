He is outstanding as a person, but he is also a great lecturer. He is able to keep students entertained while also teaching very well. His tests were very similar to lecture and recitation information, and I recommend paying attention to both. The homework was not too bad either.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MjQ1ODYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2212","date_posted":"2022-10-05 14:17:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"So far, my favorite class, I have taken. I had phys1 with probably the worst teacher ever then I got prof douguet for Phys 2 and he was a lifesaver. he cares about his students and gives probably the best lectures at KSU, overall one of my best prof.

PHYS 2212 is a very difficult course, no matter the professor. He has a bit of a strong accent, and can be difficult to understand sometimes. I relied on the textbook heavily for exams, but his lectures are thorough. Some extra credit is offered. Exams are T/F, MC, and FRQ.

He is very caring and always available after class and is willing to help anyone out who is struggling to get the material. If you can take him do it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTEyOTI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2212","date_posted":"2020-12-09 04:48:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"His course is asynchronous but recitation attendance is mandatory. Physics II is just so difficult. He is very responsive to questions and emails but he sort of made things more complicated, in my opinion. Reading the textbook will help clarify a lot. The homework assignments are quite difficult.

I didn't make this class a priority b/c I didn't literally have to sit through a lecture, and therefore my grade was not what I wanted it to be. He's a sweet teacher and is willing to go over questions you have. He does give extra credit on tests.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTg4MzQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Lecture heavy--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2212","date_posted":"2019-12-19 15:27:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Douguet is a solid choice for Physics 2212. The exam difficulty is about average. Plus, he will give some extra credit problems after each exam that usually counts for 6-8%. He will expect you to understand the derivation of some formulas. Be sure that you can derive them because those types of questions will arise on exams.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzE4MjIz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2212","date_posted":"2019-12-09 20:03:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Solid professor, phys 2 is a difficult class no matter who is teaching it but Douguet has a very clear teaching style and is always available to help outside of class if you need it. 4 tests total, gives a formula sheet and a &quot;material for exam&quot; prior to all the tests.

He says he doesn't curve but like he give extra credit that gives abt 2-4 pts which helps. The tests are 1/4 mc and 1/4 T/F and half free response(40pts usually). He is generous for partial credit.
