Had him for lab. He covers some very basic formulas and explanations before the lab, and he won't walk around and check on you.

All the lab work and the write up plus graph is due at the end of the class. Very little help from him plus he is a harsh grader( grades out of 10 and -2.5 for graph, -1 for wrong measurements/ missing ones and so on. It takes more points than it gives.).
