Although your grade is made of only 10 experiments, they are easy to get good grades on if you show up and show all your work in the lab report. Take this teacher if you can.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTczOTI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS3710","date_posted":"2023-11-28 14:57:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best professor ever.

Fear not, he is a great professor for physics 2. As long as you attend lectures at least twice a week, go to the breakout sessions when you can, and know how to use formula sheets to figure out problems, you're in the clear. Do note that he wants you to show all of your work.

He really cares about students not just learning physics but enjoying it. If you show up and make a genuine effort you'll pass his class. Attendance isn't mandatory but I highly recommend going to both lecture and recitation as he'll help you work through the homework problems.

He gives you the formulas and it is mostly just using those with not too much practical knowledge needed. Plenty of time to do the homework. Doesn&#39;t seem to build off of Physics 1 at all, and is actually easier. Very low stress class that takes little time outside of class to succeed.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTI2MTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Graded by few things--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
