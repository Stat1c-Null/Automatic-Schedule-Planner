The powerpoints that she makes are very helpful when trying to finish the lab work. She is a good grader and is prepared to answer any questions!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjIzMzkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?

She provided some lengthy pre-lectures but she was so helpful during the labs that I was able to look past it. She is always willing to help students when they are confused, which is so nice in a lab class. Take it from me who gets very anxious during lab, she is an amazing professor.

Her accent is hard to understand, but you can get the necessary information to do the lab. She helps you if you are struggling with anything during lab. Barely takes off points for things.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTg3MTE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Skip class?
