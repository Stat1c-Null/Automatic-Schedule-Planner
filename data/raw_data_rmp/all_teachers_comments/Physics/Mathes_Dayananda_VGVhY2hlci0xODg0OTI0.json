Going to class, working out the examples, and putting time into the topics he says to cover will definitely get you an A. He is lenient with grading and always curves if the class really needs it. Highly recommend him!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjM3MjUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211LAB","date_posted":"2019-07-31 00:46:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a very good teacher!

He is very lenient, curved all of our lab exams, even adding points to our final grades, met up outside of class hours to help you understand, just a very overall caring professor.

He is willing to help you receive a good grade in his class and wants you to succeed. My only complaint is that he is a little inexperienced as a professor, but for such a complicated subject he does a great job.
