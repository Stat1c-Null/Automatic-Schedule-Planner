After doing quite well in her class but I still recommend avoiding at all costs.  I wish I were joking but she knows next to nothing about physics and wont answer students simple questions.  Very rude. If I could give a 0/5 I would.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4ODU4MjM5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1112","date_posted":"2011-07-24 21:39:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"AVOID at all costs - this professor emotionally ABUSES students. Worst prof I ever had; she is defensive when asked simple questions about the material. Belittles students in front of class. Her sarcasm in not funny and unprovoked. Her temper is out of line; slams doors, yells at students. She does not grade according to the syllabus.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4ODQ2OTIy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1112","date_posted":"2011-07-13 20:06:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Literally treats her students like crap, has no knowledge whatsoever of the material she teaches, you could read the chapter in the book a few times and be more knowledgeable than her. She started to semester grading in one way, then with three weeks of class left, decides to change her syllabus and grading methods. Gets pissed if questioned.
