For exams, he gave bonus questions and a cheat sheet (both sides). The final is cumulative but if you go to the optional breakout sessions you get extra points. You should be fine as long as you study some outside of class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTcwMDE1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2023-10-25 03:24:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not the professor I registered for and got switched last minute, so it's unfair I had to get stuck with him. It's evident that he knows physics, he just doesn't know how to teach the problems very well and is very vague and dismissive with any explanations. Breakout sessions are extra credit and he gives a cheat sheet on every exam which helps.

He talks ABOUT problems during lecture, but doesn't go through and solve them and is very vague with any explanation. He's completely clueless and shouldn't be a teacher; he questions and has trouble solving any problem during lecture that hasn't been done beforehand. Take any other professor, they'd be better.
