While his lectures can be a bit jumbled , he makes up for it by putting heavy weight on homework and ensuring that the tests aren't too difficult.  The textbook has been great for me, but most do not read it. If you read the textbook, you will ace this class. But if you don't, be sure to practice constantly using his online PPs.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTI5Nzk1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2016-02-16 00:28:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I absolutely had no idea what was going on during his lectures. He read straight from the powerpoints, and I was better off learning myself. On the bright side, his tests weren't too hard, and he is very helpful if you have questions. I had to work for my grade, but overall, I would take him again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDU4NjU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
