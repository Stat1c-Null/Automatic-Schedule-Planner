Otherwise, the class wasn't too horrible. Homework once a week on WebAssign, quizzes on WebAssign every other week, 4 exams with webcam.

There is nothing of substance apart from the slides, which *may* be online, and if they are they *might* be listed as in incorrect name. You teach your self, and tests are taken online.

Lectures were slow and unengaging, and she wouldn't know how to complete examples. She pushed back everything so we didn't finish a third of the content.

You will essentially have to teach yourself the course which can be especially daunting in a short period of time.
