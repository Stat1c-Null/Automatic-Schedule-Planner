He will work with you if you get a bad grade and will help you understand. He really goes above and beyond to help his students out. Dr P is an absolute blessing.  I received a C in this course only because I didn't try hard enough. The professor is wonderful !","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDk4NDgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
