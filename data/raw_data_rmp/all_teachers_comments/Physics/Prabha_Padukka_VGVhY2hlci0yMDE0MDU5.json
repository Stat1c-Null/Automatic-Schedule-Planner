The practice problems from lecture/recitation don't prepare you for the test, and the homework is even worse. No study guide or past exams given. She does drop one test and quiz grade. She is also fairly scattered in her lectures; jumps around and makes mistakes","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODQ3NDgy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":6,"rating_tags":"TEST HEAVY--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS1111L","date_posted":"2018-03-29 09:42:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"easy lab. gives instructions and equations before you start. doesn't care about sig figs. lowest I've ever made on lab report was 90. Drops one lab but I think that's standard. Allows you to turn in labs late but she does take off points for lateness. but points off is better than a 0.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NzEzNjA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2018-03-28 11:42:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice lady, and she wants you to do well. There are no test reviews or study guides and it's a toss up what will be on the tests. Unfortunately her tests are out of 16 points so I missed 3 points through the whole test and made a 78 with her random rounding (up or down). She does curve sometimes, recitations are good.

I learned the most by doing homework, but the lectures helped a little. She would have to correct herself quite a bit, so be prepared to think for yourself a little bit. She drops a quiz and test, which is helpful. Got a 50 on the first test, did lots of homework, then got a 100 on the second.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjE3MTIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Grades your tests in one of two ways, using the way that results in the highest grade on an individual basis.  Curves on top of that too. And after all that, if you're still failing, you have the option of doing an extra credit assignment to bring your grade up to as high as 80. Also very helpful.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODA2OTUw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
