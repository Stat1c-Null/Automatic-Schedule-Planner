He really puts in the work to make it easier. Go to his office hours, ask questions, meet with him to go over homework and exams. DONT MISS CLASS AND BE ON TIME! He packs a ton of info into each lecture, so pay attention and ask questions.

But, just because he is good does not mean you will automatically pass his class. You have to be willing to meet him halfway and put in the effort to do well by studying. He will provide you with the material you need. Physics is hard, but he will help you make it doable.

His lectures are incredibly interesting and it's clear just how passionate he is about physics. I was never a huge fan of physics due to poor teaching in prior classes, but his teaching made me do a complete 180. Do not be afraid to talk to him and ask questions.
