He did not have a TA but did his best to help everyone, sometimes he may sound a little annoyed but overall he was never rude when we asked questions. Intros can be a little long and he takes off points for missing units so just be careful. I'd take him again for sure!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzE2NTUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1112L","date_posted":"2023-04-21 11:32:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor does not like teaching. He gets easily frustrated and is condescending towards people that are trying to do their labs. The manuals are difficult to read and sometimes it's necessary to ask questions; all it takes is asking what a button on a new machine that you've never seen before is and he'll get upset. Don't take his lab.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NjgxNzE2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1112L","date_posted":"2023-03-10 03:15:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"He lectures for like 20 mins, but it still doesn't really explain anything. Our TA helps us more than he does. He never explained how to use the oscilloscope, so we still have some trouble figuring out what to do with very little guidance. Just save urself the headache and take Dr. Rhybolt for both lab and lecture, or at least lab.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDk0Njkz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
