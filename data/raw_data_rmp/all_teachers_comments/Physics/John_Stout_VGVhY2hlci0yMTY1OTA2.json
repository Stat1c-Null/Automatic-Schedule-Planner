Like, he lectures and never got passionate about anything. Not very clear when answering Qs, if you don't understand he sorta shrugs, but most things he explains well. Got weekly homework and formula sheets for the five tests (drop one for attendance grade if higher). 6 Qs each, easier than homework.

You come to lab, he writes out the formulas and explains all steps, you do it and just like that you're done with lab. He usually will grade last weeks lab and hand it back before you even finish the current lab. He also inputs grades during lab. If you need help, ask and he will gladly oblige.

Go to them! Not only are helpful, but they also consist similar questions that will be on the test. His tests consist of 6 questions, each is short answer and are easy. Don't worry about failing the test, he's a lenient grader and gives partial credit. BTW, the homework is much harder than the tests.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjUxOTcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2017-04-27 20:12:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Stout is one of the best profs I have ever taken!

Go to class, do online homework (time consuming and not useful,  pay for chegg) don't buy the book it's awful, pay attention to reviews as they are variations of the test questions (don't waste time studying all material covered in class).

Take Stout.  His reviews are a replica of his test so do them, and EASY A.  5 tests, 1 final, EACH EXAM ONLY 6 Questions.  I wasted my money buying a textbook.
