Very caring and understanding about students, especially during the pandemic. 3 midterms with 2 attempts for each (highest attempts are counted) and he drops the lowest midterm grade. Final also has 2 attempts. The midterms are open note, stay open for about 2 days, and don't have a time limit (atleast during COVID it was)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODY5OTky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2021-05-10 17:47:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Such a caring and kind man.

His lectures are boring and he is monotone, but he will have the EXACT questions on the test. You can have a note card or paper for the exam. Gives loads of extra credit for the test. All you need to do is the minimum. Don't let this be the class you get a B or lower grade in.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTE3NzE1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1112","date_posted":"2019-05-08 01:09:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was literally awesome!!!! Each exam was automatically graded out of 120 which means you already have 20 extra possible points and 1 exam gets dropped. The final was out of 135 points!!! so we had 35 extra points; we had webassign homework but that wasn't bad at all. You literally can't fail this man's class.

There's a lot of online homework and pop quizzes in breakout sessions, but as long as you show up and put in even a little effort, you'll be fine.

I was able to completely turn my grade around after bombing the first 2 exams. His notes are very helpful. Lets you know what specific sections to focus on when studying for a test.
