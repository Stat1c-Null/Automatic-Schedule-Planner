Show up to lab, and Professor Alomari will show you how to do most everything. If he leaves the class on its own, he will make rounds and make sure you're alright. Super chill in general and very lenient on grading. No need for lab reports, only scan work from the lab manual.

However, Dr. Alomari held live + recorded recitation sessions on solving recitations and encouraged participation, and exams would be a variant of them + reviews.

He wasn't the best at explaining things verbally, but his lecture notes were amazing. Just study those, and your golden. I didn't bother with the PowerPoints.

Better in person, so you can interact. Provides so many examples and problems to where he will overwhelm you.

So I am constantly downloading multiple videos. I just don't get why he doesn't make one whole video for a chapter. Two, expects you to understand multiple concepts within a short period of time.
