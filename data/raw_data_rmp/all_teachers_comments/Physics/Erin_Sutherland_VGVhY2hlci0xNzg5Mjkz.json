Friendly, and respectful of students. Good lectures, but it is important that you always show up to class. Participation matters. Lots of homework, but most of it was not too hard. Tests were hard though. As long as you showed up to class each day, and payed attention, you have a pretty good chance of passing.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDMxNjEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2016-01-19 19:35:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tests are HORRIBLE.

Its your job to teach yourself. Not very helpful. She pushes students to learn the concepts of Phys rather than doing prob's. Tests were made up of 20 impossible concept Q's and 3 prob's, always tricky. Required to do online HW and come to recitation for a quiz every week.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjA3MzAy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
