His grading is clear cut and fair (sometimes generous). I've had him for multiple classes and he can seem a little rigid at first glance, but there's a reason. He desperately wants to set you up for success. He is very willing to sit down with you an walk you through tough material.

This class however has a lot of prereqs that aren't listed that are crucial, but he helps to fill in those spots.
