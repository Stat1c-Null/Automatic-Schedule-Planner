Professor offered many bonuses though. One test and two homework assignments with the lowest grade were dropped. He is carrying and tries to be inspirational but we just wanted to pass the course.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjM3MjQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Inspirational--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1112","date_posted":"2017-05-14 10:21:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Straightforward, be familiar with the syllabus , course organization and you will be good to go!

Provides study guides and studying them, and attending classes gave me a straight A. The course relays a lot on math, trigonometry and vectors.

Can exempt if you have a 96 in the class & drops the lowest test grade. So I exempted the fourth and the final because I had a  97. Lots of webassign. Study guides are literally 200+ questions wrong with several wrong answers. He does not use numbers in class when teaching. He's a little stiff but he is fair.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzA0NDAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS1112","date_posted":"2016-12-19 04:57:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Students taking this course for credit have different majors and the course seems to be more adjusted for students with not enough math background.

Prof. Uzelac knows his stuff, but does not do a good job conveying what he knows. Accent is no problem but I personally got nothing out of his lectures.

Don't be surprised if you feel overwhelmed on the first few weeks of class. His accent is hard to get a hang  of. But once you do, it should be relatively smooth sailing from there. Do all of your webassigns and study for your tests. Out of 5 tests (including final) the lowest grade will be dropped.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzcwMDUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHY1111","date_posted":"2016-04-01 23:55:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome accent which makes you pay more attention to lectures!
