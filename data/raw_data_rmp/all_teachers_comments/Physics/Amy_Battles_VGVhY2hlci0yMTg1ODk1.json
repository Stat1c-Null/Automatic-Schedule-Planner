If you don't mind those two things, you'll be fine. There are a lot of homework assignments, challenge questions, labs, quizzes every week but the due dates are flexible. You just need to turn everything in by the end of the semester. Grading is easy but slow.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1Njk4NDM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2018-12-09 18:39:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"10/10. Took online phys 1. She does a self pace method. Half of the course is due by midterm, the rest by final. I finished my first half in 3 weeks. If it's not necessary for you to know physics just google everything its all online (even labs!). But if you want to learn she provides power points and answers questions. Turn it in, get a 100.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTMzODI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS2211","date_posted":"2018-05-01 19:10:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"no real communication, don't even bother emailing the professor. Dont skip on labs or homework. She's going to give up on grading your stuff halfway through the semester and give you 100% for anything you bother to turn in, so turn everything in and you'll be able to pass regardless of test grades. You're not gonna learn anything taking it online.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTUxMjI1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"TEST HEAVY--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHYS1211K","date_posted":"2016-11-03 20:18:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"The online Physics is the way to go if you have the choice. Two proctored exams, homework once a week, quizzes every other, along with self lab reports once a week and a discussion post on the chapter topics. The homework is unlimited attempts for full credit, and most of the material is on chegg.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTI2NTIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
