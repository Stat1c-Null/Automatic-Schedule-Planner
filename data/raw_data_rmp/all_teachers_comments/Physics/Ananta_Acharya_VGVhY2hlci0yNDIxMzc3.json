I sought help from him numerous times via zoom, email, in-class questions, and received little guidance and a bit of condescension when I was confused with the calcs - he insisted I should already understand the math and did little to encourage.

But for some reason(he was puzzled too) our class didnt do too well in this class. He is very insistent on attending all lectures and gets huffy if you get late or skip any.

Your work should be done a certain way. I understood that there was a proper way to do things. The only problem I had was that he required that there was less than 5% error on labs or else he took points off. That is extremely hard to accomplish as a human.

He does his best to ensure that you will get a good grade. During class he solves plenty of examples for students to understand the concepts.
