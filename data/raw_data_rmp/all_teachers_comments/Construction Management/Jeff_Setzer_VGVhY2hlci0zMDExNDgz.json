I failed intro to structure the semester before so i took Setzers class over the summer. Night and day difference from the previous semester, he explained concepts in depth, had a very fair grading scale, gives great lectures, and is overall a great guy.

I have taken the same course with other professors and they do not compare to how easy he makes the class and helps us all understand such a difficult class. 10/10 best professor when it comes to Structures 2210. Definitely recommend Professor Setzer.

He is also very accessible outside of class. However he does get very carried away and often goes very fast. Lectures can be hard to understand, this is a hard class. He also randomly assigned 5 quizzes in class at the end of the semester. He also doesn't communicate on D2L much.

He likes to make class enjoyable and is always happy to explain more when needed. He makes sure that he explains everything in as much detail as possible so it's easier to understand.Attendance isn't mandatory but encouraged and helpful. Can honestly say this is the best teacher i've had at KSU.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTkyNTk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
