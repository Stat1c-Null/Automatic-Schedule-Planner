All quizzes AND exams are online. He also gives extra credit for submitting early as well as an easy in class participation grade written instructions are usually very vague be sure to catch them IN class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDQyMDgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3420","date_posted":"2025-04-22 23:15:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor who offers MUCH needed practical skills regarding Excel, Bluebeam and other estimating applications used in everyday jobs. Ive been using excel for a long time, and he still showed me new things I've never seen before. An easy grader who cares about his students.
