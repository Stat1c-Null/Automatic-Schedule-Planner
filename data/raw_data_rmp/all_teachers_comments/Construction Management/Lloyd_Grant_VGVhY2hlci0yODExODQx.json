He has given me the most practical knowledge out of any CM professor here. I will definitely be coming to him for any help on the Capstone project in summer. If I was picky, he definitely isn't good with technology or D2L. But he is very forgiving on grades because of this","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODk1MzM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures --Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Cm3410","date_posted":"2023-11-15 16:40:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Grant is very knowledgeable and caring. He is older so he struggles with the technology side of things, but he is very understanding and makes an effort to ensure everyone will succeed. He expects you to be at every class, but for your own benefit. He just wants the best for you and for you to truly understand the material.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4Mzk2NTgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Cm3410","date_posted":"2023-05-10 12:29:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor!
