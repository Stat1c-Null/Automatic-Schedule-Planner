Instructions are vague, delivered in brief bullet points, and lack important details. Students constantly have to ask for clarification, and the professor seems indifferent. Nothing is graded or given feedback until the end of the semester, leaving us no clue if we are doing this right. \n","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTAzMjI1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM4900","date_posted":"2023-08-02 12:06:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"responsive to my emails, gave advice when needed.

Prof. El-Itr lectures about what we needed to add to our capstone notebook, it was straight forward, but it was aimed more towards the general concentration. If in a different concentration you will need to reach out to a different profs for specifics. He will help you out as much as possible regardless.
