We had an assignment opened less than 9 hours before its set due date. I emailed him about struggling on my midterm and he insulted me and said to pay attention. He's accused me of cheating in his hw feedback just because I didn't do the hw right one time.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODU5MTA2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Beware of pop quizzes--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM4510","date_posted":"2024-07-26 03:48:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Holtzhower is one of my favorite professors. He is very thorough in his teaching, and his lectures are very informative. He has clear grading criteria, and posts videos that walk you through how to do the assignments. The first half of the semester was a little difficult, but it got easier after the midterm.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjQzOTE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Hilarious--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM4510","date_posted":"2022-04-14 17:34:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gives clear expectations for what the class is composed of.

The material is a little tricky but he helps out and has an assistant that offers even more in depth help. A few assignments throughout the semester and a final project at the end.
