He never replies to email. Always uploads everything late. This man should be fired and is not credentialed to teach.

He read off of powerpoints yet he requires attendance. He is unclear with most of his instructions. He is extremely condescending. Unfortunately, he is the only person who teaches this course at this time. Class is passable tho.
