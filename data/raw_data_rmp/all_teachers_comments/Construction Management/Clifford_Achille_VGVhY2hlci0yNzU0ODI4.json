His class was not hard however he will not allow any redos if you make a mistake, no extra credit, and absolutely no help if you happen to miss an assignment NO MATTER THE SITUATION.

Provides lectures showing how to do assignments. Also gives video walking through assignments. 10 labs, syllabus quiz, midterm, final. learned about AutoCAD and revit along with construction management software. had two guest lectures attendance gave extra credit. no group projects. seems very kind. easyness depends on software","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzI1NTA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
