Always willing to meet outside of class, and offers generous feedback on papers prior to due date. Strongly favors class discussion, but will switch to lecture if necessary. You're going to have to work, but you'll learn a lot if you put in the effort. Highly recommended for phil majors.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTEzNDY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL4200","date_posted":"2012-04-24 10:36:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Intro to Indian Philosophy. Only pre-req is Eng 1102. I took this class with no philosophical background and it was a BIG MISTAKE. This is not an intro class. You are expected to write a thesis paper by the end. Poorly organized. Felt like a kid sitting at the adult table conversation wise and it is a conversation based class. Wish I dropped it.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTA3Njk3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2012-04-10 11:57:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lectures are extremely unorganized, there is no structure to class. Each day you discuss your opinion on the readings. Only thing that's graded is class participation, discussion postings, and papers.
