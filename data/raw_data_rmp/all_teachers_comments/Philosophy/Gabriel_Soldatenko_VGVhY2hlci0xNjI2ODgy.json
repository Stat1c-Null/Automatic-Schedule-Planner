Spoon feeds you detailed notes, and distributes a list of 10 or so study questions that are identical to what he puts on the essay exams. No excuse for poor performance, then. As per any philosophy course, though, there is a LOT of reading. Fascinating course.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTIyNzMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2100","date_posted":"2012-04-17 14:20:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"would not recommend this class unless you already love Philosophy. There is A LOT of dense reading that's confusing. The 4 tests are essay questions, he grades against other students answers. Half the kids in my class dropped out after the first test and half the remaining students weren't passing. If you need to maintain your GPA steer clear:(","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDY0NzQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL4460","date_posted":"2012-04-16 20:10:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Warm and amiable, he'll patiently explain difficult (sometimes tedious) readings.

One of the best professors I've ever had.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDYwMDkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2100","date_posted":"2011-12-18 00:15:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"First of all, Dr. Soldatenko was  a great professor; I've never enjoyed a class quite as much, even as a philosophy major. His class does require a lot of reading, a fair amount of abstract thought, and decent note-taking skills.  He teaches class as it should be taught. This is a college course, not a high school level course.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTU2OTA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2011-12-13 12:09:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not easy, pretty unclear about what he expects, format changed every test.

I am an accounting major and took this class as an elective because it looked interesting and is a 2000 level class. I found the readings very hard to follow, and the entire focus of the class to be very unclear.
