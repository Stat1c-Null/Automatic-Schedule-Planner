He is very helpful, and if you have any questions he makes sure that he answers it in a way you understand. He's also pretty hot, so there's that.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTQwOTUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2011-03-22 23:27:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do the small readings and he loves class discussion.

He is very passionate about philosophy and he knows his stuff. No textbook, but you do have to buy a couple of ten dollar books here and there. He also puts about half of the readings online. As long as you come to class and read the material, getting an A is easy!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MDMxMDE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2010-11-18 11:45:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher, very easy.
