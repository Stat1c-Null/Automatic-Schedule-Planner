There are readings for almost every class, but I just watched like 3 videos on every topic and was fine. Going to class is important tho bc sometimes he takes attendance and the lectures are useful.

If you want a good professor who actually cares, take his class. There's a lot of readings to do but I generally just watch a recap video of the material online and hope for the best. GO TO CLASS, all of the work is done in person and there's a high likelihood of pop-quizzes or a short paper each week.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDQ5MTk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2010","date_posted":"2025-03-26 18:30:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"My favorite teacher I have had in school. About 1 pop quiz on the reading a week. The day varies but are not difficult if you skim the readings. Easy tests with half writing responses and not harshly graded. Best lectures, no PowerPoint, A lot of in class discussions between teacher and students. writes notes on white board as they become relevant","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODIxODcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Hilarious--Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2010","date_posted":"2025-01-07 23:55:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very caring.

He is not the type of teacher to use PowerPoint but he discusses each concept and lectures using fun examples for each reading. He also creates a very open and chill environment so discussions are fun. Reading before class is a must tho because he will do random quizzes, but they are like 4 questions","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDk4NzIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2010","date_posted":"2024-12-02 17:16:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"10/10 take this class. super nice and funny teacher, have 3 tests, all written but if you read you will pass. his lectures are super good and straight to the point. really good teacher.

All the reading was on D2L. Some of the reading was difficult, but he is a VERY skilled lecturer, and there wasn't single topic that I didn't understand after he had covered it. The tests are weighted heavily, but you're set up for success very well with study guides and great review sessions.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTk0NDI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Inspirational--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2010","date_posted":"2024-10-22 00:28:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this class. He uploads the readings to d2l, but if you don't go to class you WILL be lost. He gives very good lectures and always opens the floor for discussions during the lectures. If you listen/take notes you will do very good. He does small quizzes (aren't worth much) to take attendance. 100% would take him again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODM2Njgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
