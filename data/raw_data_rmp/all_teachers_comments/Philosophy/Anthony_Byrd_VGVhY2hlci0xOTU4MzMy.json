To get the most out of the class definitely participate. I wish he taught in my major so I could take more of his classes!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQ5MTUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2015-05-27 23:09:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Byrd is probably the best professor I have ever had. He's amazing! He loves what he does and it shows. Had to buy books, but they were not textbooks. Make sure to read and take notes! Tests are very detailed and everything he says is on them. He made learning fun again and I actually enjoyed going to class.

You must read the books to pass! The in class discussions are fun. If you do the study guides you should have no problem with his exams. Attendance is graded as well. He's also very helpful.

He knows so much about this subject and you can tell he loves teaching. Notes notes notes! Everything he says is always on the tests. The tests are a little bit difficult, but if you listen and understand the material, you'll do fine. Would 100% recommend. Does take attendance.

Our first exam was all free response, and only after that did he add multiple choice. I did better on all the free response than I did on any multiple choice! He is very passionate about Philosophy and will answer any questions you have, as long as you ASK. I did not ask for help, and I feel like that's why I got a B.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDAzMDkz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
