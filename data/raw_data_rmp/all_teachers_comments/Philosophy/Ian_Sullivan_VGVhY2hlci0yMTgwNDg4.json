Basically how the class works is: you read 4 books along with the class.  Each book has one pop quiz.  There are 4 papers that you have to write that he explains some what clearly that are easy if you read! (1-2 pages). He is very open to questions though.  He is very helpful!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTc2MTk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2017-01-25 22:22:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's fun but be advised: if you take this guy because he will try to influence how you interpret things into his way. For instance, it was clear after taking him that he really likes Kant and hates relativism. He will make bold moral statements and then ironically discuss how it's hard to know what truth is. He also frames questions to lead you.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Nzc2NTc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL1101","date_posted":"2017-01-13 08:51:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's cool and kinda hot.

He genuinely cares for all of his students, and tries his best to help everyone succeed. His lectures were interesting and thought provoking. He gives 5 pop quizzes, but gives you 3 options of what the question will be. Overall he is a great person, and I would gladly take a course from him again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzE4NTk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2016-12-15 14:42:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor relies heavily on a plagiarism program, if anything shows up even as just similar, he sends it in as academic misconduct.

He really makes sure that you understand the material before continuing, and as long as it shows that you made an attempt in the class, he will grade you very well.

A lot of work, but easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDAyNTYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

You can tell that he genuinely loves what he does and actually cares about the wellbeing of his students.

Very helpful with a great sense of humor and you can tell he's very passionate about the material. BEWARE of pop quizzes! Multiple books required, but they're all cheap/free to download online.

Great class discussion to accompany readings.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDc0MTg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
