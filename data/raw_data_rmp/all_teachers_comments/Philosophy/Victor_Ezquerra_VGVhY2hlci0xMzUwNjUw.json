He makes the class really fun with silly pics and video clips. He's also pretty laid back in class. There's always a &quot;song of the day&quot;. Make sure you read before class because of quizzes. He grades a bit tough on the take home tests. Great class!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2ODI4Mjcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2010-01-06 14:04:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class is really dull, but Prof Ezquerra knows what he's talking about and if you can make it through a lecture you can learn a lot. Tests are all take home and he gives randomized pop quizzes on readings for attendance grades. You have a week to complete the tests, which are relatively easy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Njg2MjQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2009-12-11 19:21:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very poor excuse for a teacher. He reads from notes and the book, doesn't actaully teach anything and doesn't like to be interrupted for actual discussion. I'm an A student and got a B in this class. He wasn't clear on what his expectations were. He gives pop quizzes that count for an attendance grade. He gives three take home tests. Horrible!!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTMxNjQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2009-11-06 21:03:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a new teacher and he teaches very well. His lectures can be a little boring if you already read the text but he always adds in points you may not catch while reading. His tests are take home and are pretty fair. I really enjoy his class and he's really nice to look at.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzI3ODgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
