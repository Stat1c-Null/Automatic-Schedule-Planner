He teaches philosophy as if it were a History of Philosophy, which makes the class a lot different than what it could/should be. He goes off on tangents easily, and most days the he does nothing but go off on tangents. He's a good professor though, and he knows his stuff. Class is boring, but he tries at least.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTE0NzE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHILO1107","date_posted":"2011-04-25 00:04:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is awful.

This is a very difficult class. I recommend a study group from the beginning. We taught ourselves the material. He is very willing to meet with you to help, answer you calls, and return emails.

Quizzes includes stuff ONLY mentioned in class. Quizzes moderately easy but he likes slightly tricky questions. Included some questions in final that were not discussed  or in readings-       me off.
