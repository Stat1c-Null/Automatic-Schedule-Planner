He takes attendance every single day but trust me...you don't want to miss class. Buy both of the textbooks, you use them everyday and WILL be lost without them. Be prepared to write essays and the test are all essay questions.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTAxNTI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2013-01-14 16:05:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Willing to help if you attend class and at least act interested.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjU3MzU5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2013-01-08 13:38:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I LOVED THIS PROFESSOR! He was great! Don't miss class or you will miss a lot of info. He is very helpful and willing to do most anything to make sure you understand the material, but if you read what he tells you to you shouldn't have any problems. I finished with an A.
