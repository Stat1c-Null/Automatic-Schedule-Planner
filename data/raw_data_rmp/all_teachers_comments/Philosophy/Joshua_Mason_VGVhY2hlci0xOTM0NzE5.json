I had a hard time keeping up with him for notes on his lectures, but he was very detailed and clear at the same time about the material. I did not attend class regularly and this bit me in the behind for tests and my final grade. There is a lot of reading but nothing terrible. He really wants you to think.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDg0Njc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2200","date_posted":"2014-12-15 07:40:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Mason loves philosophy. He is clear from the beginning his only goal is to teach you the basics, make you think, and get you interested. He is the best teacher I have ever taken. He is the epitome of a teacher who cares more about getting students involved in learning over begging for a grade. If you listen and interact, you will make an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDgxOTA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"81235","date_posted":"2014-12-11 22:09:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is an absolutely BRILLIANT teacher, I do not like philosophy but he got us to come to class early and start debating subjects brought up in class before he even got to class. Literally I could not imagine having to take this class with a different teacher, he is clearly in love with the subject and he wants you to be as well.

Really passionate about philosophy. His lectures tend to drag on, though I'm not super intersted in the subject. The tests are a little iffy because of how they're worded, but if you pay attention and read the material, you'll be fine. I would take him again.

His class does not throw any curve balls:  1) Read the material. 2) Come to class and take notes on what he says. 3) Take the test. 4) Profit. He's super excited to teach class everyday and is a pretty cool dude. Attendance isn't mandatory. You write a question for each class and talk about it.

I was really worried about having to take Philosophy, because I heard all the profs at KSU were tough and loved to ruin your life, but I decided to take Prof Mason cause he was new, and I am so glad I did! He's young and is new to teaching so he is still inspired and excited to teach, which really makes a difference.
