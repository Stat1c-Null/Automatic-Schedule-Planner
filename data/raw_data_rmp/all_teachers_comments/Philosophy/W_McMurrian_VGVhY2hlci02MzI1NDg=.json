You need to read  the assignments in order to understand the lecture. He is very laid back and HILARIOUS! But understand this is a philosophy class! Religion is questioned if you can't handle it then don't take the class and ruin it for the rest of us.

They are so interesting and make you want to go to class every day. As long as you read the articles that we discuss in class over topics like abortion, torture, and life and death, you will do well in the class.

This professor really makes his students feel at home and comfortable contributing to class discussion.

This is an easy class if you are an intellectual person. 3 thought papers, 1st guarenteed A. Midterm/final a little tricky but he's just trying to make sure students read as opposed to listening in class (I got an A on both, and one of them I read all semester, the other I just paid attention)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MTMzNjMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2010-12-10 12:01:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"This isn't an incredibly easy class, the grades are 30% for 3 outside papers and 30% each for final and midterm both are short answer/essay over 4 questions. But this teacher is amazing, you come out of it with a new outlook(so long as you have an openmind) which is what a college class should do. Funny guy, open to your opinion too.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTAzNzk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2010-11-05 23:51:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"I hated this class Most of the things we were supposed to read were hard to understand and try to say God doesnt exist He attempts to explain the readings in class but you have to have read. 3 thought papers:1st one gives everyone an A then after that he grades hard.

The class is a blast! I highly recommend doing the readings; he will go over them, but the tests and papers are based on your understanding and interpretation.
