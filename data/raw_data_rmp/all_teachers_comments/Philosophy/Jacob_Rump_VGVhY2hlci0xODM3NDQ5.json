He makes the class interesting, lending most of the class time to discussion. Prepare to participate and think critically. There are a few very short papers, which he grades fairly and gives great feedback.

His enthusiasm prevents the course from being boring or tedious. Gives an impartial overview of various viewpoints. A lot of writing, but his grading was fair and his feedback was excellent.

If you're looking for an easy A, don't take this class. There's a LOT of writing to do, & attendance is mandatory, but he gives plenty of feedback on papers and is more than happy to meet in his office. He is passionate & intelligent, unbiased, & not to mention stylish. This was my favorite class so far.

It isn't an easy A, but he wants his students to do well. It actually serves the purpose of a \"critical thinking\" core requirement.
