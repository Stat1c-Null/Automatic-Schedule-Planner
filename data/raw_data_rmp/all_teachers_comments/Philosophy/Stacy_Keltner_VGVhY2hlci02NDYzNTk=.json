I can't wait to take her class again! Shs is very helpful and you can always reach her by phone or e-mail. She made this class very interesting and I looked forward to it everyday. I never missed a class. Her material isnt hard but you have to apply yourself because Philosophy in general is hard.

It definitely challenges you to think. This was by no means an easy &quot;A&quot; class. It definitely required extensive reading, studying, and comprehension.

Write everything down, study it, and be able to write an exam-style essay about it.
