She is always open to complicated questions and wants everyone to participate. There is a lot of reading (every class session for next class) but all 3 exams are the same setup, just different readings. Last exam is the final and drops lowest 2 quiz scores. Take her if you can! You just have to stay on top of your work!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMzM2NDU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2018-12-06 12:55:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dont get me wrong, its a hard class, but with Professor M, i wouldnt hesitate to take it again, the constant homework got annoying but its understandable with the content. She was definitely one of my favorite professors though. All exams are the same set up, including the final, so youll know what to expect. Just show up and pay attention.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODkyOTI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Amazing lectures--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2018-11-08 11:54:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. M is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is absolutely hilarious, and she explains the unintelligible content in a simple way that makes sense. She's always willing to help, and encourages questions. However, the homework assignments average around five to ten pages, and you MUST read them before next class or you won't get credit.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjg0ODU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2018-11-08 09:50:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor M is very passionate about her class, however it is almost impossible to get a good grade in this class. It is extremely difficult. For every class there will be a writing assignment or a 4 or 5 question quiz. Her tests are also impossible and are graded very tough.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjgzODE4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2018-11-07 22:28:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Mirzakhan is hilarious. Passionate about philosophy, class is always fun since she's so goofy and the whole class gets all fired up about philosophy. Lots of reading and assignments but it's never difficult, just pay attention in class since her handwriting is intelligible and do all readings, could be pop quizzes.
