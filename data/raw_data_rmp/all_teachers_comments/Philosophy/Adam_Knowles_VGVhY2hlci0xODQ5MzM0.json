He was clear with his expectations and also made learning interesting which made paying attention in class very simple. His class consisted of assessments (quizzes) and tests and I aced all of them. He also offers extra credit. I had his class as an 8am and I made sure to go to every class!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTM3MzU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2013-12-06 15:22:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really good teacher who tries to explain everything in great detail and always helpful in class. Sticks to the schedule so you know what to expect. You have to read some sort of difficult texts but we go through them thoroughly in class so you'll leave understanding if you didn't before. Takes attendance, doesn't tolerate distractions.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDU1NjA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2013-11-21 08:11:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Knowles is extremely funny, kind, smart, engaging, and fun. You have to read before every class, but the selections are small, and he does a great job at explaining what was meant by the text, and he clearly cares about whether or not you understand it. Classes are based on really interesting discussions. Very enjoyable class overall.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzYyNjM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2013-11-08 17:00:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor! Very smart and kind. He really knows his stuff. You have to go to class to do well, but he explains all the readings in class. He can be funny, keeps class interesting, and is willing to help anyone. Definitely recommended!!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjgyNTUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
