I got a 35 and a 40 on the first two. In the beginning of the semester we started out with 27 people in the class. About 8 people were left by the end of the semester. I do not recommend taking her.

Her class is heavily effort-based so if you just put in the work then you will pass. She is super good about replying to emails so that's the best way to reach her if you have questions. READ THE BOOK because there is a mini-quiz every class.

Bedard is passionate about what she teaches, super nice, and a great instructor BUT philosophy and all the philosophers you have to learn about will make you want to pull your hair out!!!

You will get buried. Second, Her tests are tough to where a 60 is considered good. And when you write the research paper, for the love of God, CITE EVERY SENTENCE; She WILL fail you. That said, she's fun and helpful, but she could be unforgiving â€” Take at own risk.

She's definitely not an easy teacher, but her class was one of my FAVORITE. I loved her Ways of Knowing class and although it's tough, it's only because she makes the students think for themselves.

If you have a 15+ hour schedule, this class is not for you because it is a lot of work. It's a lot of effort and though she can be helpful, it's hard as heck to get through this class.
