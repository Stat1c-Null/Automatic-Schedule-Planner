Makes complex concepts seem so easy and so miniscule. You will have to put in effort to study for the tests and get the readings done on time.

The weekly quizzes can be a bit hard but the tests are easy as long as you go over the study guides. Attendance mandatory though, and he will fail you if you miss 12+ classes. Very fair teacher though, and some extra credit but not a whole lot. I would take him again and be happy with it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODk3NTU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Amazing lectures --Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
