What I liked about his class was it had a clear structure and grading guidelines. What I disliked was his tendency to go off topic and ramble. he is a good guy and he is pretty funny, you can tell he cares about his students, but he needs to be more concise. He is definately a good choice for a gen ed","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzI4MzQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL2200","date_posted":"2018-06-01 09:31:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"A solid choice, friendly and helpful.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMjE5MTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHIL1101","date_posted":"2018-06-01 09:03:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was an easy A, and it was enjoyable because Dr. Boshears is a nice man.

I was very unexcited about taking a philosophy class, but he is a great lecturer &amp; he'll explain something 100 different ways if you ask, just to make sure you understand it. He really cares. Attend class, take notes, read books &amp; you'll do fine, kid. I promise its actually fun.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTgyMjk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

A midterm and final based on questions that he gives you. Literally same questions he gives you in class as objectives are on the midterm and final (noncumulative) which i loved cus i hate cumulative . Not a super hard class, but a lot of reading that is manageable.

He often cut himself off mid-sentence to jump to a new thought and began explanations with examples before defining his terms. Would not take again.

If you read the books he gives you and take notes during the lectures, you will get an A. He is caring, and he respects his students. He is hilarious, and his humor is the only reason I was able to pay attention during his 8AM.
