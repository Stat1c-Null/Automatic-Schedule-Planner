Professor Wilson's curricula will make you work for the 3 credit hours, and the content is somewhat challenging.  However, the readings and videos were very informative.  The questions are thought provoking and answering requires careful reading and analysis.  His feedback on assignments is excellent!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjEyNjY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
