He's not a tough grader, but he is strict on the similarity score on Turnitin. He has a mandatory group project where you cannot work alone. The project is a 3-page, single-spaced paper. He does not have a clear rubric for this paper. I would not take him again if I could avoid it.

He posts labs that have confusing instructions (often outdated) with links to videos that often contain instructions contrary to his own. There are no sessions in which he reviews the assignments.
