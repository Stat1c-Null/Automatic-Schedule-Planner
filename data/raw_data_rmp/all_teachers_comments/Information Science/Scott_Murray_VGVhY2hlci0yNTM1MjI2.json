This is supposed to be a simple and enjoyable class, and somehow, this man has created it to be more complicated than it needs to be. I was confident that i would at least get a B in this class, but I ended up with a C..

Professor, while knowledgeable about the topic, puts minimal effort into increasing the students' knowledge of the topic. He grades as if the student is a professional. Even if you put effort, there is no guarantee you will receive the grade you want. He often takes off points for criteria that were never stated anywhere.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNDcxOTQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2024-11-06 21:43:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a professor who responds rudely to emails and does not have care for students.

Most weeks consisted of reading + a quiz due on Fridays. Some weeks had a project which were usually never too hard although he expects you to already know how to use Excel so he gives you the project and thats it.

My issue is the fact that a few projects assigned were not taught (Excel,HTML coding), and it was left up to the student to complete with little to no direction. Perhaps this was a curriculum issue, however.

Keep in mind, this class has a lot of busy work, so you cannot procrastinate. Quizzes every week, a midterm, final, several assignments that take a good amount of time to finish.
