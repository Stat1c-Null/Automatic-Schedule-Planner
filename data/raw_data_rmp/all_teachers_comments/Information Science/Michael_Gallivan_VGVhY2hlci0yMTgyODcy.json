Instead his information was anecdotal at best or related to how he used other analytical measurements or tools that were not even related to course material. Often times when it came to the syllabus and writing assignments, he would contradict what he said in previous classes or the syllabus.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMjAzNzg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IS8090","date_posted":"2017-06-19 06:09:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor should be a researcher only and never allowed to teach a single student.

Save yourself the aggravation and take another professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDY1Nzc5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IS8935","date_posted":"2017-04-21 12:10:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Consistently late to class. Doesn't know how to use school-wide computing system properly so communication is lacking. Poorly communicates expectations on assignments and grades suffer. Busywork from reading and videos.  Poorly executed quizzes.  Has a syllabus, but creates assignments and group work at his leisure.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDk2ODM1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IS8090","date_posted":"2017-01-11 18:20:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!  Worst professor ever and no exaggerating!  He is very disorganized, doesn't provide timely feedback and changes grading requirements after submittals. Spends ridiculous time on analyzing grades and no one cares.  Likes to talk about himself!  Learned nothing from him.  Please take someone else.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzE3MjE5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
