Her lectures can seem as if they are slow at some point but she makes an effort to connect with the class. Attendance is mandatory. There are midterm and final exam which are fairly easy and done online. The class is mostly hw quizzes every week and is made up of projects and a group project.

Always down to explain her assignments in more detail and help students. Very easy class. She did jump-scare me when she said, \"nice to see you again, (my name)\" after I was absent for like 3 classes, but she's super chill. You can also retake assignments to get a better grade. Definitely take her class if you need it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTE3NzMw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2024-04-27 00:07:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT listen to the only bad review lol. She was great. She was a little uptight at the beggining of the semester, but clearly showed her efforts to be on everyone's good side as the semester went along. She is CLEAR on how she grades everything. Simply follow directions, put in moderate work,  and get an A. Extra credit also offered couple times!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjgxOTE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2024-04-23 02:51:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Bantan wants students to succeed in her course and offers a week extension from the due date which is very helpful. The rating below was overtly exaggerated as the class does want attendance for class participation (it is apart of your grade btw). Accessible outside of class and willing to work with students.

She will walk up to you and make you speak in front of the class, and memorizes everyones name. HUGE nerd who sees you skip class twice, and literally notifies the school that you \"fell behind\" and need tutoring. I purposley wouldn't wear my seatbelt in my car in case i'd die before her class. AND she takes so long to put in grades.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDE0MzUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2023-12-08 22:11:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Bantan is very kind and shows a clear desire to know and help her students. She is accessible outside of class, quickly responding to emails.  I did dislike the structure of the course, but it wasn't designed by her, so that's not on her. Expect a lot of information coming at you in powerpoints, weekly quizzes, and reading assignments.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTgwNzM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
