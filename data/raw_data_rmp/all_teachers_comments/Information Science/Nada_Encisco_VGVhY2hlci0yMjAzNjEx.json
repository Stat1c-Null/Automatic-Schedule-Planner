She is a very caring professor but she mainly had guest speakers come to the class (they were really interesting speakers). Most of the material had to be learned outside of the classroom, but Professor Encisco would take time out of her day (and weekend) to help her students.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTUxNjg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2018-05-08 18:51:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wish I took this class online because that's what it was like. Class time was filled with guest speakers 98% of the time. Interesting lectures, but barely had anything to do with the course itself. Didn't learn anything other than a little bit of excel. If you want an easy A, take her. If you want to learn IS, take someone else.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDI5MDc4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2018-05-02 21:03:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Such an awesome class. I took IS online last semester and actually withdrew, but this time I had a great experience, and actually learned a lot of things in word, powerpoint, excel, that I used and will use in my other classes. In class notes/presentations, random attendance points, open note/book midterm final. Definitely recommend!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTY2MTEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2017-12-05 11:48:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty easy class. Dr. Encisco is a very nice professor and will give great feedback on all assignments. There are discussion posts, quizzes, 2 tests (that arent weighted too heavily), and projects (including a group one). Not a lecture-heavy class so more often than not there will be guest speakers.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDQ1ODQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GROUP PROJECTS--Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2017-11-07 20:03:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor is extremely unorganized, lazy, and not knowledgeable on what she should be teaching us.
