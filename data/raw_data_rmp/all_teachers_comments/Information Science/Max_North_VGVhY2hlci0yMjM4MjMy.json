The final and midterm are worth about 30% of your grade but everything else is completely online with answers easily available. He grades projects very very leniently.

The only good thing is the extensions he would give for assignments. He also gives 2 Excel projects and gives no help on them, and just provides a YouTube video on how to finish them.

I was confused with the course and the course material and when we spoke he blamed me for everything and said I should drop this course and take it again instead of actually trying to help me and clear up my confusion.

Some assignments are bit hard to navigate, it was harder for me since i didn't reach out for help. Very gracious and clear with grading, it would have been easier if i made more of an effort to ask questions.
