The group project is tedious, and unfortunately counts a lot towards the final grade. Lots of busy work and projects, and the two exams cover a ton of material from the textbooks.

She was very caring and wants you to do well in her class. Although there is a lot of material and assignments to complete, she helps every step of the way. Go to her class because she offers extra credit if you do so. One midterm and one final. A quiz every week and she allows for 2 attempts. One group project.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODUxODM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
