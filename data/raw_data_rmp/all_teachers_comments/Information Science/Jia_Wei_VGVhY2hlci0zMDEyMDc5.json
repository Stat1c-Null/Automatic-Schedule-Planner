Provides extra credit for attendance. There are weekly quizzes, if you take notes on the power-points then you'll do well. The exams are lockdown browser webcam but a note sheet is available. She goes over the assignments in class. And a final group project. She gives you enough preparation time for everything!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTk1NDI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2024-11-05 19:19:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Suuuch an easy class! If you go to class then she literally does the assignments/projects and you just copy what she's doing. Also a very kind and caring lady. She takes attendance, but its not mandatory, but def recommend you go because you will have no other work to do outside of that class because you will have already done it along with her!!

Just memorize the PPTs and you'll get an A. Every assignment worth 55 pts is easy (Final Grade is out of 600+ pts).Connect used for quizzes and test.Cheat sheet allowed on test.

While going to class isn't mandatory, she gives out extra credit for coming. There is a few projects that she does with the class, and one group project at the end.
