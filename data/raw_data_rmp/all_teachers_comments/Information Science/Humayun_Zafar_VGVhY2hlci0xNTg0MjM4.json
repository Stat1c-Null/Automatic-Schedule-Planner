The only things that matter are professor responsiveness in a timely manner and timely assistance with labs. It took weeks to get help with one or two basic questions. He deflected responsibility as a rule. When he did finally get to me, it was clear he was not familiar with how to proceed with the lab.

You must attend class to complete the in-class labs and runs on the honor system where at the end of class if you tell him it's done or have it done by next class you get a 100 for that lab.

He doesn't care about your grade so much as if you know the content. Attendance is somewhat mandatory since you do in-class labs which consist of coding challenges, but you can work with other students. Again, he only cares that you learn the stuff and collaborating with other developers is a real-life scenario.
