Instead of being clear in lectures, he has you read the books he assigns, and make posts about what you don't understand to have other students answer them. If you ask a question that he doesn't want to answer he simply ignores it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzQ4MzU5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IS8700","date_posted":"2019-07-26 15:21:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Attendance is a part of your grade, but this was a summer course so it made since. I'm not an IS major, and I did not find this course hard at all.

Learned more from textbook, YouTube videos and other students through the required discussion board posts. Entire grade comes down to basically 2 exams and a group project. Provides poor direction as to how to prepare for exams and doesnt seem to care if students do well in his class. Worst professor I have had.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODgwNjQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2018-07-24 10:48:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"I wish I had a review to go by before taking him. Read every assignment for date and assignment discrepancy and email him immediately. He does not answer emails very quick. If you are like me and expect teachers to have better grammar than you do, stay away from this teacher. Watch his grading as he counts off even when you follow directions.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzY4Mjg1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
