Exams are flexible, being open book and no lockdown browser. he keeps lectures lively with humor and stories from his  work at Cox. getting at least a 'B' should be the least for this class. I wish he taught more information system classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mjg3NjM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS3100","date_posted":"2022-12-15 19:10:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is not a Comms class, it is a Microsoft excel class.

I genuinely have no idea what I learned because I don't know what I didn't learn. Can be a bit harsh when grading papers. Really funny guy though and might give extra credit.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDgxNTg3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Test heavy--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS3100","date_posted":"2021-12-03 03:21:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved taking Professor Treanor! The class wasn't hard. Quizzes are the hardest part but make up a small part of your grade. Open book tests and 2 case studies. Worst part of the class was a group project with incompetent classmates. Attendance isn't mandatory, but he offered extra credit on certain days when attendance was low.

The material is boring, but its obvious that he actually cares about his students and the course.
