I've had her for two semesters and she's great, she's incredibly generous, and you can literally only fail her class if you don't read or if your writing is garbage. I put in 0 effort to this class and got a 100 twice. A literal 100. The other two people leaving ratings have to be drastially stupid.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzQzOTk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INTS1198","date_posted":"2019-05-01 22:45:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class online.
