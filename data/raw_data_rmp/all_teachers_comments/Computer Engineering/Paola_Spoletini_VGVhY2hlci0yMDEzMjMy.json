She's usually in her office during posted hours, and is always willing to help you with an assignment. Wants students to do well. The only issue I had was that we didn't know any of our grades; she just emailed us if we had an A, B, C or whatever at the end of the semester.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTkxOTU5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE6673","date_posted":"2019-05-29 15:54:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Paola Spoletini is a great professor.

She does not grade anything until the last week, and your final grade is based upon the few items she manages to grade. The topics she chooses to include in her curriculum are somewhat interesting, but most of them will not help you get a job. Easy A, but not worth the money.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODgyNzk5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SWE4324","date_posted":"2019-04-20 12:08:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Few professors in KSU are as inspiration and qualified as Dr. Spoletini.

I've had her in a few classes (not by choice) and it's the same style over and over. She teaches the easier classes, but then makes them into THEE hardest classes ever, unnecessarily.

Her class was hard but she made it fun--and she taught it in a way that we would actually learn something. The one downside was that the main part of the class is a huge group project -- which can be stressful. The tests are also 100% written, but to me were fairly easy. She also leads research studies, which is great.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Nzc1MTQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE4324","date_posted":"2017-05-08 00:01:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty easy homeworks require a minimal effort like you can get a good grade with just being straight forward with no fluff.
