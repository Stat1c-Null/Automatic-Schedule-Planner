Few projects (which require a fair bit of effort) and the mid-term and the final ended up being the only real grades in the class. Paying attention and reading through the power points (and/or skimming the book) will land a B for sure.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MzY2MDAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":5,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE3643","date_posted":"2014-07-08 00:04:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"The professor is very unclear. The final project's requirements were changed without informing students. We had to ask many times of what we were required. The final grade is heavily dependent on tests which are mostly short answer. Midterm is 30%, so is the final.

Worst multiple choice tests ever. 'a','b','c', then 'd' is 'a and b'.

His classes were great, yes they can be challenging but we are in college. The most positive thing I took from him, is that he is approachable.

However, this is imbalanced to his tests, which are very short (roughly 10-15 questions) and use short answers.
