The semester is over tomorrow and I have no idea what my grade is because she has not put in any grades. She gives 0 directions and takes SO long to respond to students and when she does it is not helpful at all. I would not recommend taking her. This class was MUCH harder than it should be.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjQ2MDI4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2021-10-10 12:29:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Definitely would not recommend if there's other teachers available for the course. She's very adamant about writing a certain amount for each discussion post. No quizzes, lots of writing on different readings. We had to purchase a textbook that's only used in one assignment out of the 10+ assignments she gives.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTE0NDYw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2021-10-08 01:50:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take this class unless you want to write six paragraphs a week... as a discussion post. The readings are difficult and ridiculously long. She made you purchase a book that you won't read pass the introduction. I do not recommend unless she is your last option, there are easier GWST courses.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTExMDYy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
