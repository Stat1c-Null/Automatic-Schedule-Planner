It's a pretty easy and enjoyable class, you really just have to do the work, read and show up. She also gives plenty of extra credit opportunities which is appreciated. Only \"bad\" thing I can say is expect to write a few three-page papers throughout the semester.

The papers are 3 pages long and she makes sure you reach that page limit. The class itself is easy but long and full of reading and writing. She will sometimes do pop writing on the subject, so make sure you read the textbook before class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTI1Nzk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2024-12-07 23:33:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I enjoyed Professor Bobos class!

If you do the work you will pass. Lectures are very interesting and interactive, we had very respectful, educational lectures about great topics that we can relate to in our world. Attendance is a participation grade. The weekly discussions are easy , they align with the weekly readings which are easy. Very easy A with effort.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTAxOTMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2024-11-20 04:35:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"It is a very easy class with easy topics but I have never had a professor so nit-picky about the essays and discussion post. I've had easier English professors than Lavonia. Be prepared to be writing discussions post every week, and 3+ page papers. I personally would not recommend.
