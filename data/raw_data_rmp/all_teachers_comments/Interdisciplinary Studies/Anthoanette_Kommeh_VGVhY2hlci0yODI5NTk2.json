She didn't know how to work D2L for the first half of the semester, so no one knew what assignments we had. I didn't receive any grades until exam week. She showed up 15 minutes late and one time didn't show up at all. Would switch to online 30 minutes before class started.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTI1MDc1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAX1102","date_posted":"2024-01-13 02:56:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not organized at all. So much reading where the textbooks are very biased.

She's a nice woman, but can be challenging to get a hold of. She does take a while to grade assignments, but typically gives a fair curve. I'm sure she will be better in the next few semesters; she just needs to gain experience. Not horrible, but definetely struggled a bit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjcyOTQx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAX1102","date_posted":"2023-12-12 01:43:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class thinking it would be an easy A, however I was wrong. First of all, this professor takes 4-6 weeks to grade assignments, I still have assignments from the first month of school that haven't been graded, takes a long time to respond to emails, and added random assignments that weren't in the syllabus. Please avoid this professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjIwMjA0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PAX1102","date_posted":"2023-11-20 23:49:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"You would think this class wouldn't be too bad, but this professor makes it WAY harder than it should be. You have to do lots of textbook reading, but the assignments themselves aren't too bad. The reason this professor is so terrible is that she takes WAY too long to grade them. I'm getting grades in now I should have gotten 2 months ago.

Discussion posts were graded like formal essays, but it took 4-6 weeks to get grades back.    No video lectures were recorded. This class started out a mess and became a nightmare.

Be prepared to read almost every page of the massive textbooks. Quizzes were shockingly hard and grading was often delayed for weeks.
