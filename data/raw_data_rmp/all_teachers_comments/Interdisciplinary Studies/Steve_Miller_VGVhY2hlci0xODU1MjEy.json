His classes are not mandatory, but his lectures are fun, informative, and interesting! He strives for student success and shows it. No tests, mandatory reading and gives mid and final questions beforehand, which are the same as the exam","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDQzNjM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1111","date_posted":"2014-01-02 17:07:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Miller is engaging and funny, held discussions in each class which he used to compile questions for his \"tests\", which weren't hard at all. The answers were provided on a study guide beforehand. Show up to class, and complete your portion of a small group project and you'll get an A.
