In my previous classes, quizzes were simple recall of new kanji/vocab, but hers require recall of older kanji/vocab. She is great, but please don't take this class if you have a lot on your plate.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDk0MTAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JPN3200","date_posted":"2023-09-06 13:42:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Negrelli sensei has shown a lack of full understanding that students have studied the lessons required in this class, the previous semester. When asking questions in class in regards to material we are unsure about, she can be quite rude in responses and often will look up the answers in comparison to the native speakers in the lower classes.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjA1NTU1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JPN3200","date_posted":"2021-09-28 17:07:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her schedule system is confusing. I love studying Japanese but she does not own up to how confusing her homework schedule can be sometimes. Most of your struggles in this class will be worrying about what's due next rather than studying the material. She doesn't cut slack for honest slip-ups in assignments. Don't recommend but she's my only choice.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDkyMzcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Skip class?

The upper level Japanese classes are hard and compound on previous chapters she will drill you hard. Test and quizs every 1-2 weeks. Study do the homework!! Final was brutal but doable. She is a good teacher as a lot of material to cover you have to put in the work","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzA2NzI2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Skip class?

She makes Japanese so easy. Attendance is not mandatory, but she grades participation which has 30% of whole grade. HW takes 20% Quizzes take 15% Tests take 20% Final takes 15%. So, if you are thinking to take this class, go to class every day. You will have great fun with her and learn a lot about Japanese.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTUyNjIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JPN1001","date_posted":"2013-12-22 18:10:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very good instructor, very professional. Infused a sense of humor and wit in class and when it came to explanations. Come to class, read the book, actively participate in class and you'll do fine. She wants her students to succeed and you can see it. Very dedicated and has a high interest in the country of Japan. She even leads study abroads there.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjQxNTU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JPN1001","date_posted":"2013-12-16 04:22:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"GREAT PROFESSOR.  Sometimes we had misunderstandings but she definitely seemed to enjoy what she teaches.  Sometimes she'll get frustrated if you don't understand, but it her frustration showed that she actually cares.
