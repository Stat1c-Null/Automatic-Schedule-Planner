Made it feel like a real classroom, and gave personalized feedback for each assignment. 10/10, would take her again if I need a Japanese credit. Very sweet professor!

Very kind and supportive. I did an Honors Contract with her, and writing stories in Japanese with her help was awesome. However, her guidelines for class projects should be more specific (also noticed some of her stuff seemed outdated, for Summer 24'). Besides that, she's fun! A wonderful prof for my first Japanese class. :)","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTUwMjIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JAPN2002","date_posted":"2024-03-28 19:35:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"The Japanese courses are difficult if you aren't willing to put in the work. If you do, and you study, you will be fine. Professor Kim is wonderful and I've had her as a professor several times before this. She is adherent to deadlines, so make sure you remember to do your homework!
