But honestly as long as you do everything it is easy to.  She helps you in any possible way and she cares for each student.  She's hot, fun, and makes Japanese interesting to learn.  She can be scary though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjY2MzU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JPN1001","date_posted":"2016-01-04 23:46:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the best professor at KSU hands down. She has a passion for teaching and is TRULY there to help you gain knowledge and teach Japanese. She has an innovative style of teaching, and her class lectures are filled with MANY kinds of activities to appeal to auditory, visual, and kinesthetic learners. She's hilarious, caring, helpful, and AWESOME.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODc2NDQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JPN1001","date_posted":"2015-11-16 16:56:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a native Japanese woman and is very knowledgable about teaching the language in easy ways for us.
