However, it was hard to communicate difficult questions sometimes and her style of teaching is very fast-paced. Lots of homework and it really adds up. Exams were much harder than 1001 in my opinion. Highly recommend utilizing the tutor for this course.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDM2OTY2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JPN1002","date_posted":"2022-05-12 17:00:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is a language course, expect to have to learn the language. There's homework due every couple days, and 1 or 2 quizzes a week. Exams are straightforward and match the homework and study guides. Grades are spread out between many things (good). Class performance is 15%, grading is kind of random. Raise your hand and do your best, it'll be fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzIxNzg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JPN1001","date_posted":"2021-12-22 01:52:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Nagai is honestly a very sweet lady, but her class is the exact opposite. There is a quiz/test every week and you need to study every day to make a decent grade in her class. All teaching material comes from the textbook and there's homework due every other day. The class was fun and all, but I would definitely not do it again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjI3MDAw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Skip class?
