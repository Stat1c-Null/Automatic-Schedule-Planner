This class you had to put in effort to get an A but I had a blast in this class. It was the only fun class I have ever taken. You have a lot of group projects but you get to know everyone well so its not awkward once you get passed the first few weeks.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzA0MjI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPE2300","date_posted":"2022-11-10 16:31:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE.

She never lets students try explaining certain parts of a lesson, as I knew some of the material, and yet she obviously blew me off telling I didn't know it. She's also a paranoid technophobe.
