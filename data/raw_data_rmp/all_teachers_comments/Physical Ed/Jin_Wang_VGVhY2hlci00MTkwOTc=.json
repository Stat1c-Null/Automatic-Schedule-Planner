Gives \"motivation points\" (extra credit). Doesn't post PP but if you get the foundations then the book can help. He likes to break up into groups and talk about sections and then discuss as a class. Homework is normally in groups and if you do it he gives full credit","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODUxODgw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3200","date_posted":"2014-11-20 13:52:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet professor, very helpful, easy going VERY SMART","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzODYxNTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS3200","date_posted":"2012-05-04 11:26:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very good professor! I loved his class. If you don't understand something, see him after class and he'll be happy to help. And come on, it's college people. If you are disturbing the class, or talking while he's talking, then he'll call you out.

He makes jokes all the time in class and I love going to his class. I learn so much. For the previous responses...if you did not like this class then you might want to reconsider your major.
