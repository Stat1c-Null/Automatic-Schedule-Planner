She likes to talk about how &quot;bad&quot; she eats but works out whenever she isn't teaching. Almost no point in reaching her outside of class since she doesn't do office hours, appointment only.

She will be tricky on her 2nd test(with surprise material not on the study guide),gives you long ass study guides and asks very few questions off of them. NO opportunity for extra credit:(!
