Grades are 0 or 100 and makes you critique your work 37 times before he gives you a 100 if you get a 0. Also has a major attitude. If you take anything from this post DO NOT TAKE HIM! Unwilling to help you unless it's helping you fail!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjU1MTY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Entrepreneurshi","date_posted":"2023-11-18 15:58:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Friendly & energetic. All assignments are online with 1-5 due weekly. They're critical thinking assignments, so the amount of time they take varies. Class isn't mandatory, but suggested to build connections. In class, you do 1 out of the few assignments due the next week. He guides you through it & you share answers with multiple other students.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDE1ODk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lots of homework--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
