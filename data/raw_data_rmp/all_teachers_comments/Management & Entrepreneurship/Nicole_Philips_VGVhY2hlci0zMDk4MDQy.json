Very condescending and dismissive of student concerns. Awful at answering emails; takes several follow-ups for her to respond to you out of annoyance. Takes no accountability for her mistakes. Vague instructions but strict grading and unclear criteria.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTU4MTYz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
