She is making everything harder, she had so many hw to due every week and still expect you to study for the test. You will basically have vocab quiz every single class. Her class is so overwhelming, like we don't have other classes works to do. Just do yourself a favor and don't learn Korean with her!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzk3NzU1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KOR1001","date_posted":"2019-11-07 19:15:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing teacher. I really learned more Korean than I expected to in one semester. Every class implements writing, speaking, listening, and comprehension. There is a ton of homework but that is what helps you learn the language.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzc3MjQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Audit/No Grade","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Skip class?

Has very high expectations &amp; will hold you to them, regardless of if you're able to meet them. Lessons go by too fast &amp; it's too easy to get behind. Nice person, frustrating professor. Do your homework or fail. Show up to class or she'll sass you.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDExOTkx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KOR2002","date_posted":"2016-12-12 11:44:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"With Professor Lee, there will be a lot of work. So much so, that it gets overwhelming. In her defense, I think she sincerely does want students to do well. But she will make every chapter harder than it needs to be, and will demand more work from you for THIS class than most. Oh and her demeanor is terrible, passive-aggressive at best.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDQzNzI3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

She comes up with a lot of activities and work. Sometimes there is A LOT to do, esp the higher you go in the Korean classes, but you have to work to learn properly. That's why I put she is not 100% easy. you have to put in effort to meet her halfway.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MzY1NzM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KOR2001","date_posted":"2014-12-03 20:51:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's the main Korean professor at KSU. She's AMAZING! She really cares for all her students and wants us all to pass with A's. The material is covered really quickly but you're getting in a lot of practice if you go to class and follow her suggestions. Go through ppts to pass every quiz and test with an A!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzOTQwMjAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
