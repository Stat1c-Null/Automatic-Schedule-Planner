His knowledge of the world and his personal history is fascinating. However, his teaching ability is rather low. His English is very broken and can be incredibly difficult to understand. If Italian is not really required for your major and is just an elective, I'd recommend taking him.

Wonderful teacher, but you do have to teach yourself if you want to ace the class. He goes over what you need to learn in class and how its done, then you go home and study it and perfect it.
