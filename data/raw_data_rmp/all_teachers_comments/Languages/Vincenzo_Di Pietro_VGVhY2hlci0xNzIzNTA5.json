Off the bat he WILL call your name in class which at first was embarrassing but when you realize none of the students know what they're doing it's comforting. There's group projects, and only 3 tests a semester, but weekly assignments. He likes seeing students show they care to learn Italian and putting in effort.

His heavy accent at the beginning could be hard on you but after few lessons you get used to it. He doesn't like when you don't try to learn and I can understand that.

He gave us work that was way above our level and didn't learn anyone's name. There was only 9 in the class. He thinks the only way for people to learn was to embarrass them by making them read aloud. He didn't try to be mean, but he was.
