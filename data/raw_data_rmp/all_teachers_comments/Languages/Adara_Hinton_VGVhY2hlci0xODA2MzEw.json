She knows her stuff and only looks in the book to make sure we can follow along. Will often go on about the myths and stories surrounding something come across in the book, but if you're into them it works out well. She also gives you more than enough chances to turn in work and extra credit.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjU4MTk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LATN1002","date_posted":"2013-04-04 06:58:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor, interesting stories.
