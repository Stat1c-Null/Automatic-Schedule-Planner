She explains things very well and clearly knows her stuff! Even the more complicates aspects of German were very thoroughly taught and made simple. Also hilarious, she's got a good sense of humour.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzUzOTg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN2003","date_posted":"2018-07-17 18:45:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Frau Wuertz-Hurley for my grammatical German course, a very hard class in general. However, she was willing to explain things in detail, and despite the course being fast paced, the entire class seemed to follow. She was also willing to sit and talk with those who had questions and tries to improve the class and asks students how she can","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzUyMjI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN2003","date_posted":"2018-07-17 15:46:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"2003 is a very intensive course, hence the 6 credits. The workload is heavy but she is a very fair and understanding professor. If you have questions or issues, she is easily approachable and will work with you so long as you put in the effort.

She is the sweetest professor I've ever heard. I could never imagine her being &quot;condescending&quot; like some of these reviews claim. She has a deep passion for teaching and it shows in her lectures. She assigns a good bit of homework but it is usually light weight and easy. Takes me like ten minutes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODQzNzkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GRMN1002","date_posted":"2017-08-10 12:12:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I Stafanie's 1102 GRMN class last year and had a wonderful time.

Extremely helpful and gives you great feedback. It's a fast paced class so try not to miss class. She will speak more German than English at times but it's helpful and she'll also revert back to English if we all look confused. Encourages you to use German as much as possible. DO THE HW!

She will mostly speak German with you so it is great for learning. The 2003 course everyday really helped solidify the material. I am going to take her again for sure.
