He's Haitian, so having a man with a French accent trying to teach you Spanish is rather difficult to understand. He's old and he forgets things a lot which is really frustrating.

Seriously, you would have to bomb everything to make a B. Extra credit out the ears. Anyway, class was a snooze, but he takes off one overall grade point per day that you miss, so go to class.
