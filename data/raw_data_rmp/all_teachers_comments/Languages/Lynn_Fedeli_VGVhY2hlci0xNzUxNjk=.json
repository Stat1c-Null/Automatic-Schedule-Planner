The negative comments are probably from the people who were used to getting easy A's from other professors. Stay on top and ask for help, she is very approachable, one of the best teachers.

Save your time and your GPA. She causes students to be emotional which leads to depression, at halfway during the  semester a lot of students dropped, at times she loses track of what she is saying not an easy grader, very sarcastic, do not take her.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjYzNTA4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITAL1001","date_posted":"2011-11-15 11:52:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"The nicest person! Very thorough, deep understanding of subject matter. Tests are not super hard, just make sure you're reading along in the book, practicing at home and doing assignments online.
