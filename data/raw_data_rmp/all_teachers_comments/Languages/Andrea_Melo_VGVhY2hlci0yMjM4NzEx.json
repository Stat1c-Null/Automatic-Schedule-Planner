I have had the privilege of having her for both fall and spring semesters this year. She genuinely cares about her students and is enthusiastic about you learning Portuguese. She loves Brazil and it makes her happy when she sees that some of her students love Brazil as well. She is so nice and helpful!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTE4Nzc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
