I learned alot and class was always fun... however... she is extremely unorganized and not clear with assignments/due dates. She never turned anything back to you quickly. Rarely responded to e-mails. It became very frustrating.

My French writing improved a lot in her class. I had her for French 3305 too and I went from getting D's on papers to getting A's. She corrects all of your papers and lets you rewrite them. Her french is beautiful and your accent will greatly improve. She is EXTREMELY helpful especially if you see her outside of class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTMyNjI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FRENC3000","date_posted":"2009-04-19 16:32:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet person but not a good teacher.  Totally disorganized moving academic stuff for the talent show which I really don't see why in the world we do this ... this is college, not high school.

As the semester progressed she seemed scattered, due dates were flexible and we spent way too long on the opening class question (like what did you do this weekend), so long in fact that sometimes we didn't spend any time on grammar points. She would jump into the examples before any explanations.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NDU1NTg0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FRENC1002","date_posted":"2009-01-22 15:24:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"She just didn't really know what she was doing.

She seemed to have a grudge against some students.  Slows down pace of class for everyone's understanding and then makes up for lost lectures by testing and assignments every lecture the last 2 weeks of class.
