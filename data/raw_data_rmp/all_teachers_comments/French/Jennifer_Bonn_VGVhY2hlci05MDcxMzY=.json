Goes extremely fast, like continuing on with lecture when 1/2 of the class is working activity assigned 5 minutes prior. Does not \"pound in term\" learned.

However, I didn't think she spoke enough French in the classroom. She left too much opportunity for the students to speak English with each other during group work.

She is so easy to talk to about random stuff and she is very down to earth. If you suck at French, she can prob make you like it and you can def pass her class. However, if you want to learn the language she rushes over everything assuming we know it so if you are not naturally good, you may need someone who will 'go slow'.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDU1Mjc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1002","date_posted":"2012-04-05 17:39:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"A lot like a high school class.
