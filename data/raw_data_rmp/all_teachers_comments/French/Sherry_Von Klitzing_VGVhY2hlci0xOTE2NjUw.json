She's somewhat new to teaching so she occasionally gets confused, especially when it comes to VHL (online text and assignments). There are a lot of online assignments, but she counts them as participation. Also, she goes page by page in the book. If you pay attention and show up to class, you'll do fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTU3ODU3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1001","date_posted":"2014-09-19 23:25:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's really nice and she means well, but her teaching style is not the best. If you ask for help, she will try to help you to the best of her ability. I think she may be new to teaching. She assigns a lot of homework on the book's supersite and expects you to just pick up French easily. She does not seem to understand that this in an intro class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjAzMTg3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1001","date_posted":"2014-08-25 12:00:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take her if you're not somewhat fluent already. Her directions and everyday speech is in French, so unless you already know it you will be lost.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTU0NzM1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
