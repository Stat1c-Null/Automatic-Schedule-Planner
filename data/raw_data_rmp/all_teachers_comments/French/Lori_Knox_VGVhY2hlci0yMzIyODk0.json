I have never taken french before, so I often feel at a disadvantage, but she is so patient with the class and really cares about our success. She's so relaxed and helpful.

Probably the sweetest professor I've ever had and she wants all her students to succeed. You get two &quot;free&quot; absences but after that you get points knocked off your grade. But its worth going to class. And there is homework assignments online like once or twice a week, and a few project/presentations that are really simple.
