She knows a lot about the French language and it is very easy to get a good grade in her class. She always says she is more focused on the students \"learning and understanding\" more so that grades. Also, I suggest going to the foreign language lab. She gives extra credit for that and a lot of other things!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjc0ODQ2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1101","date_posted":"2012-12-06 12:05:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved her class so much!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTY5MjY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FRENC1001","date_posted":"2012-08-19 20:01:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Madame Drought was a very helpful instructor.

Just watch for some her pronunciations, to very picky learners, it can cut your ears. But, leave no doubt, she's a great Professor to have for an entry level course.

She makes learning fun with her little games and by making fun of the lame educational videos. She can be sarcastic or mean, but I don't think she means to hurt anyone's feelings.
