Teaches his class like a high school class and also treats his students that way. Must ask permission to use the restroom. If you a looking for an easy A though, look no further","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzMxNjA2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1001","date_posted":"2013-12-11 11:49:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you did not take French in high school, you are going to have a hard time passing his class with an A or a B. He has a great personality but he is very confusing. It is not his accent that is confusing, but the way he explains things are.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTA1NTYz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1001","date_posted":"2013-11-08 09:48:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Lonji was just overall hard to understand. He doesn't speak English very well so he doesn't always understand the questions you are asking. He doesn't know how to use the supersite very well at all so we never knew when homework was due. That being said, he gave handouts in class to help better understand what we went over in the book.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjc5OTc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
