Because of this, students who participate little, don't engage themselves outside of the class, or any other lack of effort in learning will find themselves receiving low grades. The content isn't hard, but new languages will require some effort.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTk1NTA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN2001","date_posted":"2024-11-21 15:54:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Swami is one of the nicest professors I've ever had.

All she gives you is the textbook with assignments. She has mandatory interviews with her and makes you do group skits when it is an online class.
