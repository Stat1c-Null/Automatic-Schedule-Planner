Not an 'easy' professor, but she does her job very well. Grade consists of tests (4), Supersite homework throughout, writing assignments (3), a Cocktail Party that is mandatory, and a few extra assignments here and there. You do need to buy the book for her class. There is not better French professor at KSU. Take her if you can.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDY2NDM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1102","date_posted":"2012-01-03 17:31:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Madame Bray is a very nice lady. I did not have a problem getting an A in French 1102. She is fair and flexible if issues arise on the Supersite or elsewhere. Her lessons are mostly clear, but you will need the book to learn to spell what she is saying in French. I would definitely recommend her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NjYwOTc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1102","date_posted":"2011-12-17 09:26:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ms. Bray is a Good Teacher. However, a lot was missed because she would talk in French the whole class period. This is an 1102 class French is still new to us. Wasn't clear on assignments on Supersite. The way she taught made the class worth while. And she was willing to help if you needed it.

A lot of assignments including online HW, papers, the cocktail party, an oral presentation, tests, & both a written & oral final. Very &quot;question & answer&quot; oriented teaching style.

I am an older learner returning to school & she was extremely supportive.  She gives you the opportunity to succeed if you apply yourself.  It's not a hard class but you had to work/study to get a good grade, which is what school is all about.  I recommend her and am taking her for the next course in the fall.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODEwMjI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FRENC2001","date_posted":"2009-04-06 20:28:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a really good teacher.2001 is a hard class but you will learn a lot in the class that will help you in 2002.She is always willing to help and is very enthuastic about the class she's teaching.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NjE0Nzc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FRN1001","date_posted":"2009-03-16 15:01:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Bray is excellent!!

She is a hard teacher, but you will know a lot of vocab when you're done with her class. She's very big on speaking the language in class.
