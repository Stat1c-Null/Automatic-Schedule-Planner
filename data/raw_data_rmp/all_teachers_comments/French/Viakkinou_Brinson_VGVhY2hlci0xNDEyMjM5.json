The work for this class isn't difficult, just unnecessarily time consuming (hours more than my math and bio classes combined) and often irrelevant to the actual subject.

Assignments are very lumpy--30 mins one day, many hours the next--and often poorly communicated.    After killing yourself to complete a paper on time,  she might extend the due date.   She will make you understand and love African culture, though.

To sum up her class, there's a lot of writing involved & a lot of literature analysis. I can't emphasize the importance of having an opinion about what you read & backing it up with evidence.
