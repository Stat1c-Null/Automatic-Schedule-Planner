We use the book in class, but all the homework's online so you can get away with sharing during class. Extremely scattered and very unclear on her expectations, but as a result she often will give you A's for things you didn't even do. She's willing to help you with whatever, but it didn't actually improve my French much.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDIxNzQ1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FREN1002","date_posted":"2011-04-10 00:07:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very kind and understanding.
