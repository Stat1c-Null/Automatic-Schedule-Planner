Sarcastic and knows when you bs her assignments. Her quizzes are based entirely on her ppts, but she reviews what the quizzes will be on the week before so you'll know what to study even if your notes were bad. Pretty down to earth for an art teacher, doesn't give too much work.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTM4MDcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARTS2020","date_posted":"2013-07-09 00:04:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a good teacher, she's a bit unorganized, but only because she's an artsy person that has her mind everywhere. Nice. We had one major Poster project. she helps throughout the semester to make sure you don't wait till last min. If you do exactly what she advises on the project as she critiques it you are guaranteed a passing grade on it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTU0MTc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARTS005","date_posted":"2012-12-17 12:41:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"I can honestly say I DID NOT LIKE THIS CLASS!! Her class is pretty easy to pass but hard to get an A in! Read the book because the ppts in class are created exactly by what is in the book. THese creates the quizzes. She RARELY has any quizzes. There is an EXTRA CREDIT assignment and an essay! DO THEM BOTH!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDk4MzY5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1101","date_posted":"2011-11-10 10:43:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"SO knowledgeable and interesting!  Took this just to fill a Humanities req but have loved every minute!  Feel like I can actually &quot;understand&quot; a lot of art.  Must pay attention, attend class, and READ the textbook!  She provides powerpoints online for help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjA2ODAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
