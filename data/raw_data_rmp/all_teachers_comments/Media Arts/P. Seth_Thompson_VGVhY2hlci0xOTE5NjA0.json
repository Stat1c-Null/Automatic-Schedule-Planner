He's a fan of movies and horror films, so you will watch some movies and video clips to get a better understanding. Interesting lectures and not too many assignments. I would definitely take him again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzODcyMjAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARTS3000","date_posted":"2014-10-22 18:15:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"The majority of this class was spent watching good older thriller movies like Blade Runner and The Shining. Seth is laid back and pretty easy but his tests are based on vocabulary found in the reading, but reading isn't necessary; he covers practically all of the material during in class discussions. Definitely would take again; easy & laid back.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjgzNzE1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
