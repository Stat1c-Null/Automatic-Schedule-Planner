Her video lectures and assignment directions are clear and organized. She even gives detailed feedback so you know exactly what you did right or wrong. Some weeks were more work heavy than others, but the work was very easy overall.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTE1Nzc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3000","date_posted":"2015-01-08 17:14:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loved her. I want her back at SPSU actually. The guy they replaced her with is a complete nightmare! Professor Rule was respectful, courteous and well organized. She listened to students and was always understanding.

She is very nice and funny. Her video lectures are extremely helpful. The class was a lot of work if you were new to web design but she does a great job of explaining it. We joked that she could teach an ant to use the internet. Really enjoyed the class and learned a lot.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjQxMDk5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
