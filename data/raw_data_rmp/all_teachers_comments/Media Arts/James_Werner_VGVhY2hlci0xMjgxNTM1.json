He is arrogant, but one on one, he somewhat tries to help. You will need to know the textbooks front and back, but, luckily, he rarely gives exams.

Dr. Werner is the most inspired teacher I've ever met. He's helpful & always willing to help. We even once talked for 1+ hour after his class around 9pm. He offered me a film shooting project($20/h).

Do not take this guy. His lectures were very boring, and you could not follow them because he flipped through the slides extremely fast, not matter how hard you study you will not make an A.
