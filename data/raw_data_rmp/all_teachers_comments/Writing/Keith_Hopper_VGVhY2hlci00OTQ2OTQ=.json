He truly wants the best for every student with leaving nobody behind who try their best. Will have about 5 papers to write , he'll explain clearly what needs to be done and the textbook helps a lot ( get the textbook). You will write a lot but it's reasonable in becoming a better writer.

You do not need the textbook, I never used it and popped an A on every paper. His class are his lectures (which are long and boring), but the class is overall easy A. You have about 4-5 papers (which range from 1-2 pages each), a PPT presentation as the final, and attendance is a grade.
