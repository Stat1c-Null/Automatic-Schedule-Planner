She never answers emails, very little explanation of assignments, and gives examples of the assignments that are outdated. The first month of this course was very easy, but when group work began it was HORRIBLE. Also, she has only graded like 2 assignments so far.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDQ5MjM2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM2010","date_posted":"2025-04-07 17:45:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Rarely answers emails, and due dates for assignments are very unclear. She gives lots of major time-consuming assignments with vague instructions and provides the most group work I have ever had for an online class. She also never grades assignments. This class has been a lot more difficult than it should be, and I will not be taking her again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODg1MjY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM2010","date_posted":"2022-11-03 01:28:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"She responded to emails maybe once a month if ur lucky, assigned you group projects worth a significant portion of the grade without providing any details on how to contact them, and grades everything late November so u don't even know ur grade until it's too late.

I am taking her class online and she is very fair. I am taking all online classes due to covid and she is by far the best communicator out of all my professors. Her quizzes are hard. However, if you bomb the quiz and you communicate with her she might even let the class retake it!
