Every week there is an attendance discussion (just Copy/Paste) plus a Friday writing. Some weeks there are discussions Monday and Wednesday as well so LOTS of writing. 4 projects that all vary in focus. Fun class and I definitely recommend her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTk0MjQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WRIT3111","date_posted":"2023-05-07 22:34:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor with high expectations. \n\nGet ready to treat this elective like it is a main course. \n\nConstant busy work -- most of this class is COMPOSITION, not editing.

She gives prompt, detailed feedback for each assignment with suggestions for improvement. Very caring and knowledgeable.

No tests or quizzes, just 4 major assignments &amp; participation(the reading is helpful but you can get away with not reading). It is an editing class so be ready to share your writing with others. Dr. Bahl facilitates a great class environment.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzM4NTI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WRIT3111","date_posted":"2021-08-15 00:46:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"You have a lot of busy work (3 discussion posts per week). She doesnt offer feedback on editing practice, yet she grades the projects pretty hard. Aside from the projects, the work in this class is often unrelated to our reading. Shes a nice lady, but Im disappointed with how little I learned about editing from this class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDI3Njcy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WRIT3111","date_posted":"2021-08-05 12:43:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is so kind, caring, and sweet. She gives great feedback on assignments, is super flexible about making up work (asynchronous editing class) and she makes sure to take care of her students. I can tell how much she appreciates feedback herself too. Two textbooks, heavy reading, but 10/10 would still recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDA3Nzgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
