It seemed like a fun class at first and became the worst class I have ever taken. Calculus was more fun. she grades super strict and the workload is insane.

HOWEVER, she assigned more work than any teacher I have ever had in 4 years of college. 3 page response, discussion, and another assignment due every week. Final paper is 5000 words. A partner project that took my friend 25+ hours. Worst work load I have ever had: DONT TAKE HER!!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjkwOTMz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
