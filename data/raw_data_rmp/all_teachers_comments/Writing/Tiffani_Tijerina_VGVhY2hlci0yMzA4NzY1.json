Grading is weird, but you will get used to it. If you follow the assignment guidelines and say you deserve an A at the end, she will give you it. There was a textbook but I never opened it. Overall, very easy class, would take again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTE1MzIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Graded by few things--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM2010","date_posted":"2024-11-20 03:46:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"TERRIBLE communicator, there is 4 main projects for the semester and she has only graded 1. how are you taking THIS long to grade assignments and you don't even have in person classes to teach? she's flexible on assignment dates ill give her that, but i do not recommend her as a professor overall, she's also very rude in emails","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTg4MjI4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM3030","date_posted":"2024-05-28 18:37:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's an organized and thoughtful instructor. She regularly notified us of what was important or required in the course too. The entire course mainly focused on 1 major project with different milestones for us to complete.
