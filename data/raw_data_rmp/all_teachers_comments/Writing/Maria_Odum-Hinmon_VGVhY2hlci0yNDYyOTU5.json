While you can tell she cares a LOT about her students, she provides minimal to no feedback on assignments. The quizzes were a lot more difficult than expected. Her course seems easy on paper, but she grades relatively harshly. She does have lots of extra credit opportunities though. Does not round up.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4Njc2NzM1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2135","date_posted":"2021-11-02 02:20:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Odum-Hinmon seems to really care about her students and the field of journalism.
