Responds fast to emails and is always happy to help I often sent her my work to review and she provided me with feedback. There is about 4 major assignments and a group project but they were easy! She also provided an example on the projects which helped.

Very clear and concise about what is expected of you. A lot of reading, group work and discussions. Very prompt when responding to emails and she leaves great feedback on all assignments.

She is very easy to reach outside of class and gives feedback on almost all assignments. There are several group projects, but they are painless.
