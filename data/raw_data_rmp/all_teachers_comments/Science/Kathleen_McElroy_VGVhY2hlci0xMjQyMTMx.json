She reviews a lot, almost in every class, so you kind of guess what will be on the test.  There are 4 tests, she drops the lowest grade.

SHe reads from preprepared power point and doesn't really expand on much. PLus the class is not mandatory which made me skip alot because it was painful to attend.

This professor is unable to explain anything she teaches with precise, affirmative answers. She reads from prepared notes in a soft timid voice to a class of 200 students. She may have a masters in science but is unable to teach what she has learned. Waste of money, she should not be teaching.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTUxMjQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1102","date_posted":"2009-01-18 22:53:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"soft spoken, somewhat timid for such a big class size. You watch lots of videos and answer questions about them (that don't get graded). I got an A, but i'm not sure how because I didn't buy the book or study until the night before.
