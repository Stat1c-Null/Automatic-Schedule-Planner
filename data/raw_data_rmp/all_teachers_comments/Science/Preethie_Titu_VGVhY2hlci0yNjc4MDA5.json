While I liked her as a person, she was not my favorite professor. She is a very tough grader and does not grade anything until it is too late to fix. She was not very accessible and when she did answer, it confused me more. I would take another professor if I had to retake this course.

It was the same format every week, basically the same as ISCI2001 but with physics. The material was tough but everything was open note.
