Classes are not mandatory but its good to show up because most of his lecture notes aren't online. Only a few tests, lab quizzes and small homework assignments. Still provides some PDFS of slides, study guides, video clips and the textbook for tests.

He is very organized and makes detailed study guides for all tests! And always let class out early!
