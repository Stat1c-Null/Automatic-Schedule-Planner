I did homework for other classes during this class and just read the chapters and took notes on them afterwards. Tests are exactly from the book.

So many people are judgemental and give her a bad review because she has a speech impediment, but she is, in fact, one of the best professors that I have had here at KSU. If you don't understand something she is more than willing to sit down with you one on one and explain. She is sweet and really cares about her students.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDk4MTA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1101","date_posted":"2017-12-26 21:28:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Don't bother buying the textbook, most of the course material is basic knowledge you learned in high school. To get an A, just do all the online MES and study for the tests and you should be fine. She also made us do a lot of unnecessary evaluations.

BAD. She talks about all of the subjects in the book, but is one of the worst public speakers I have ever encountered.

Yet, she's very informative and gave extra credit to help.
