All she does is read off of PowerPoints, which she puts on d2l. Test are based on application of the principles but all she does is read you definitions so tests are challenging. Science is a gen ed course and she makes it VERY hard.

Gave many opportunities to earn extra credit/bonus points. All you need to do is pay attention in class and read/skim the book.

Highly effective for curing insomnia, however. Many times, the tests were on material that wasn't scheduled. Lectures are useless, as I am capable of reading the slides myself.

Her tests come from no where. She doesn't lecture because she reads the powerpoints word for word. The homework is easy and the lab quizzes are ridiculous. Her class is the hardest I have ever taken and she doesn't really care if you fail or not. Really hard to pass this class.

Unless you memorize the textbook you'll probably bomb the tests, which are vastly different than what she teaches in class (reading off powerpoint central!).

A large majority of my class failed the class. Mastering is easy and the labs are straight forward and online. She does read straight off the power point. 3 tests and an optional final.

Do not take this class w/ Hoban if you want to make an A. There is so much busy work that helps in no way for tests. She is so boring in class, reads straight from power points.
