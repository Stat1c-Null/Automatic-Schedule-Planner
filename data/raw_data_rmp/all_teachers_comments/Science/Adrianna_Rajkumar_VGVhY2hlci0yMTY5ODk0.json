She is literally one of the easiest professors I've had in college. All the reviews saying she is hard are from idiots, as you honestly have to be an idiot to not make an A. She drops the lowest test grade and 2 lowest MES Activities. Easy class, take her for an easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Mjg5MTYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--TEST HEAVY--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1102","date_posted":"2017-05-01 23:19:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's not a horrible person, but her teaching skills are not the best.

This is the most horrible class. She can't teach. She lectures straight from the powerpoint, but her exams do not come from her lectures (or the book). I am a straight A student, and this class was difficult for me. The wording on the test is confusing and she is no help.

You don't really need the book, as you can Google a lot of the answers.
