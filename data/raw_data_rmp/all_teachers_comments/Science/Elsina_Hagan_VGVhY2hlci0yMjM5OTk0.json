I bought the book and did not even open it, study the powerpoints and its an easy passing grade. A lot of people in my class barely showed up to class or were on their phones the whole time,then complained about her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Njg0Nzkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSH3100","date_posted":"2017-08-02 20:34:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had some issues in the beginning, but she does actually care about students understanding the material and passing. Her accent is heavy but just ask her to reiterate, she wont take offense. She's a pretty cool person in general.

She does have a bit of an accent but you can understand what she is saying. There are three exams and five assignments throughout the course.

Has a very thick accent and moves through material fast. Her class is all lectures on powerpoints another instructor wrote, but the powerpoints are posted on D2L. Does not review for tests, and the test reviews given are very vague and only got me Cs and Ds on the exams. Takes forever to input important grades.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTY5MDAz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSH3100","date_posted":"2017-03-30 16:29:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"teaches this class as if we want to be food scientists and didn't even know there wasn't a prereq for this class and told us thats why we were all struggling in the class. she's unorganized, extremely unclear on the type of answers she wants on lab reports, blames students for \"not knowing how to study\" when we all fail her tests","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTcxNTU1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSH3100","date_posted":"2017-03-30 16:25:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"WORST teacher I have ever taken. she didnt bother to even write her own syllabus, didnt know her own office hours & didn't even know what version book students should use. all 3 of her classes are failing her class bc \"we dont know how to study\". she blames students for everything so get ready to receive no help when struggling & be talked down to","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTcxNTI4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
