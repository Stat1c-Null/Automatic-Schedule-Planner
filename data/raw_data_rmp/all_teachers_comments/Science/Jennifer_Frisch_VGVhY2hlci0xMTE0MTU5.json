She cares about their success and provides prompt, helpful feedback. She goes above and beyond in addressing the needs of her students and builds her course around these needs.

She is so funny and nice, and really helps you out. She drops the two lowest quizes, and if you do well on the final she'll drop the lowest test grade too.

Is passionate and knowledgeable. Always many opportunities to learn. With that aside- She is rude. Mumbles when she talks, has low self esteem etc etc. And last time I checked- Professors are not allowed to add assignments after the syllabus has been handed out. She did this. I'm glad this semester is almost over.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NjI3Njg5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2002","date_posted":"2009-01-10 00:36:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is awesome!!

She loves the subject and wants everyone to fully understand what's being taught.  If one person has a question, she will go over it again, making sure everyone understands.

Test are difficult only if you do not study. Labs are last the entire time. She will help guide you but does not tell you the answer point blank. At the end, she will summarize the labs (if you stick around and do not leave early). Overall, great class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTUwNTQy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2002","date_posted":"2008-11-02 14:20:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's fun, and makes being in class fun and interesting, and she's always willing to help you.

She is not very clear explaining the subject, but she will help you if you go to her office. Her tests are really really hard, but she allows test corrections.
