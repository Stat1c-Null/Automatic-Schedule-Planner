He takes a minute to get grades back to you but he's not a strict grader. Weekly assignments, 1 Midterm, and 1 Final (you're paired with someone based on your grade in the midterm so do well so your partner won't be a headache lol) ","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDA4OTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Data-1501","date_posted":"2023-05-03 16:02:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really great professor. He goes over the excel workbook in class to help with the assignments. There is a midterm and final project, it's best to start on them early because there is a lot of work to do.

He walks you through every Excel assignment in class, and provides very clear rubrics for any and all assignments/homework. He is super lenient and laidback when it comes to any problems you may experience. He's truly great, if you take DATA 1501 be sure you get him as your prof!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Nzk5NzIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Data-1501","date_posted":"2022-12-15 00:44:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Caleb is so nice!
