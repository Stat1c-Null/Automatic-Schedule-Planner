As long as you are capable on being accountable with yourself and do the labs and work, there is minimal stress. This class is about teaching yourself on whatever is provided for a module.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTI1MTUz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1101","date_posted":"2025-07-24 04:24:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"I do not know why Dr. Eugene is rated so low. Yes, this class is challenging. There are labs once a week, and normally a test every 2 weeks. It is a very fast course, but it is very manageable. The people who did not attend class for labs struggled the most. The labs are very time-consuming, but go to class and she will answer any questions.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTIwODAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Respected--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1102","date_posted":"2025-04-24 23:46:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Did not have to attend her lectures at all, either way she did not have a microphone so it was impossible to understand what she is saying. I would say this class is very easy, she isn't a tough grader at all, also she isn't very good with replying back to emails. This course is all about self teaching yourself.
