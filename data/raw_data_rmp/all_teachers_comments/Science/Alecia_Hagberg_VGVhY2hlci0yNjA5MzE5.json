I was nervous about her bad rating at first, but she was my favorite science professor I have had so far! She makes this class simple and not overwhelming at all. We had a few labs, modules, and a few tests. She is very understanding and easy to work with. She does take a while to grade but only a week or two. Overall, easy A!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzUzMTg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2002","date_posted":"2021-03-22 16:50:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shes been so great and helpful.

There are NO labs graded. Most of the grades that are in the system are completed automatically, aside from maybe three things she has graded. I have no idea where I stand in this class. The last day of class is in five days.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNDk5NTMx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
