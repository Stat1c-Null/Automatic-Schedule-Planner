Tests and quizzes are the same week, the quiz is after the test which is a little weird. SO MUCH HOMEWORK. I went to every class and she just reads off the slides. Try to find another prof before taking this one.

This prof makes it very easy to pass. Her lectures contain basically everything that will be on the test. The textbook is a little pricey and that is where the hw is, but there is a free trial that last 2 weeks and she'll reopen all the hw on the last two weeks of class. 10/10 class!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzQ4ODA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1102","date_posted":"2023-12-16 16:21:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"I never went to class, just did my Pearson homework (super easy) and the test that were lockdown no camera, and got an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzA2NTMw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
