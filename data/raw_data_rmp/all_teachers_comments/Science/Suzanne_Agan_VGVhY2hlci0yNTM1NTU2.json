She's very caring and helpful. She gives you all of your assignments ahead of time and gives clear explanations of what she expects. The class itself is pretty easy. I took this class online but she still tries to make it fun. She also drops some of your lowest grades at the end of semester!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDYxNjA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1102","date_posted":"2020-03-25 06:11:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor agan is the best Professor Ive ever taken.

Students should make sure to keep up with assignments or else they could risk getting a poor grade in a relatively simple class. All of her test questions and quiz questions are found on Quizlet or on her video lectures so remember to keep up with those.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODU1NDMw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1101","date_posted":"2019-12-03 18:41:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take professor Agan, for an easy A in SCI1101. All homework and quizzes are on Pearson but not lockdown. Lab Quizzes and Tests are on d2l, not lockdown, and are very easy to pass. I bought the textbook and never opened it once, and finished with an A+ so the textbook is not necessary to purchase. If you need help, she emails back quickly.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTExNTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
