If it was not for this professor I would not have passed Phsyics. By far one of the best professors at Kennesaw. Love him. He actually cares about his students and how well they do in his class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzAyMjcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHYS1111","date_posted":"2008-12-05 08:59:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is not an easy subject but Mr. Barker does his best to boil it down to simple arithmetic. Required homework most every week, four quizzes (really tests) and a comprehensive final. If you do the homework and practice quizzes you will do fine.
