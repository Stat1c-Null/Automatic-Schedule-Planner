Class is about 100 people, and completly power point. You don't get alot of 1 on 1 time,thats what recitation is for. Test were very inconsistent. Some were really easy others weren't.

He is very passionate about his field of study, and makes chemistry pretty easy to work with. Attendance was 5% of the grade and he'll be more lenient the more you go.
