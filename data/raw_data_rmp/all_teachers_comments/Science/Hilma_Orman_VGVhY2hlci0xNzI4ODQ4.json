Shares lots of personal and irrelevant information durring lecture and its very difficult to determine what will be focused on the exams even after the review. Grades unfairly and inconsistantly. She was never prepared for class and I learned nothing from labs and barely anything from class. Hated class with her. Do not take.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzc5NjUx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
