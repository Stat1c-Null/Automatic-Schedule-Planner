He gives lots of extra points here and there for showing up, and sometimes gives freebies on the tests. He's kind of busy, so he doesn't really care about the lab part. 4 tests, 3 labs, 1 homework for every chapter. An alright class","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njc5Njg4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--EXTRA CREDIT--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SCI1102","date_posted":"2017-01-04 20:51:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome teacher! His Lectures are long but somewhat entertaining. His tests are JUST LIKE the study guide. Do the study guide and you will pass every test. Attendance not mandatory, however, it would be best to go.

Just take notes and listen in class, he gives decent extra credit, more than we deserve. He is really sweet and easy to work with. He is a newer professor and gained a lot of respect from me.

Wasn't engaging or funny, but he tried to be. Lectures are powerpoints that he uploads. His tests were easy if you did the study guides, but he tends to throw in things that he mentioned once in class so you gotta pay attention. Need MES thing, and just get ready for a monotone voice and boring stories.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzIwMTA3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SCI1101","date_posted":"2016-11-09 12:49:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed his class. I wish that I could have taken him for 1102. He is to the point and very knowledgeable, though more about biology. You can tell that he is making an effort to be the best teacher and help students succeed.

LOL. He was a bit of a scatter brain. He tought straight from the book powerpoint. Did not know the answer to a lot of questions. He did try though. Hes not bad to look at so that is nice. He was  flexible about extra credit which was awesome.

He is origininally from Ellijay, GA and is studying to finish his master's in Science.

He did change the attendance policy mid way through the semester to encourage more students to attend class and began taking attendance. He used the amount of times you showed up to class as bonus points on your next test. Power points are online.
