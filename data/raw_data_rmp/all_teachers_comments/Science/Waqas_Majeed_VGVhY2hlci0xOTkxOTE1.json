I would watch videos, think I understand the content, then go to class and his word salad would somehow make it harder to understand. His take home final took me 16 hours (no exaggeration) to complete. He claims that he does not fail people, but you will NOT learn!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTc0NjI1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MTRE3710","date_posted":"2020-04-28 23:58:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very poor professor, looked like he was learning it a long with us.

This lab section should have been an easy A. It wasn't because he made us do formal lab reports FOR every single lab. As the semester went on he changed group lab reports to individual ones. He explained things horribly made the labs way harder then they needed to be. 0/10","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTM0NTE0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MTRE3710","date_posted":"2020-02-21 08:53:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"The slides he uses lack in material so you definitely have to listen during lecture.

He carefully explains everything and complains when no one contributes.  He'll work through at least one problem for every concept.
