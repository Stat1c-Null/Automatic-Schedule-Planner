HE DOES NOT TEACH. You teach yourself along with your group every week by doing worksheets together. He just sits there. This is a useless, redundant class, and it's so difficult to actually take it seriously.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTE0MjIw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2001","date_posted":"2011-10-24 17:49:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"This 'teacher' is not a teacher. He never teaches!  I did not learn anything in his class.  You will always get an A but his worksheets are hard work.  All you do is worksheets, in class and in lab.  I dreaded coming to this class.  I would NOT recommend this professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTAxOTk3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2001","date_posted":"2011-05-22 12:12:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Golden is a sweet old man who is flexible and can be helpful. All the work is in groups so if you miss a class, you will probably get a bad group grade. If you miss a lab class, he will let you make it up on your own but it is SO much easier to do in class because sometimes the labs aren't clear. It's an easy class if you go every time!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjQ3MzQ5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2001","date_posted":"2011-01-19 00:15:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a sweet old guy.

Two take-home tests and in-class final. Grades generously and is happy to talk about the material but he talks in circles.

Don't buy the book b/c you won't need it. Rely on the internet to do all work and tests. He is not clear or changes his mind on what he's looking for ref. answers. Grades fair. If you are good at &quot;fluffing&quot; your way through a class instead of actually wanting to learn it, then this class is for you. Tests are mostly essay.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzODIzODQy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI2201","date_posted":"2006-12-03 02:39:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lots of group work...very easy.
