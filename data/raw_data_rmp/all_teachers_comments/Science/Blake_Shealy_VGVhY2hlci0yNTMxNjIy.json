You definitely have to study because there's a ton of quizzes and the tests can be tough, but he rarely had homework for us so it was all in all a great class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjYxNjE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Hilarious--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2001","date_posted":"2019-11-03 15:19:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Shealy was an amazing professor. His lectures were simple and easy to follow and so were his tests. He would spend the day before a test day reviewing the material that we have learned and telling us exactly what we should study for the test. If you study and pay attention, you'll be fine. Take him if you can!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzUwMDA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
