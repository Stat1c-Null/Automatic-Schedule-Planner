He is also very vague about what's going to be on his tests. If you can get a different professor i would but if you have to take him you have to be self motivated, study everything he gives you in detail.

There should be no negative feedback for this prof or class unless you did not show up for lecture. Everything is from his own website, study guides provided, videos, extra credit points.
