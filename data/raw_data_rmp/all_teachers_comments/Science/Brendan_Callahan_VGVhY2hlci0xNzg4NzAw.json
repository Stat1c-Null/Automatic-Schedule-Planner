He is all over the place and created random grading scales on the spot. content is not hard and he does create a lot of opportunities to pass and get a really good grade, he is just very confusing. He doesnt really teach much unless you ask him to. 4 total tests, module quizzes,extra assignments and lab reports","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzgwNDM5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ISCI2002","date_posted":"2017-12-12 23:48:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"the class was hard, he allows you retakes on the test. The material in the beginning was hard to understand and he was a little awkward at explaining it. The class became easier as the semester went on. I made it out with a solid B and I never missed a lab and only two classes.

It is very math-intensive and there is a lot of memorization one must do. Still, Prof. Callahan allows re-takes of all the tests and is always willing to help if you don't understand a concept.

I would've liked his class a whole lot more if it wasnt at 8am twice a week and gave more \"real life examples\" of material we would go over in class. i appreciated his values on how retakes should completely replace the original grade because the same material is learned-just at a different time.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjE4MDQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2002","date_posted":"2015-06-30 08:56:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's funny and dorky.
