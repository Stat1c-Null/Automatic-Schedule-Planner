I was worried about taking them both at the same time, but I have high A's in both classes. I have her for asynchronous online: quizzes are open-note and so are tests, take notes on the modules and actually pay attention and you'll get an A.

She was really nice and always very excited and enthusiastic to teach science. We did a lot of fun experiments and a bunch of CERs. Her tests are pretty easy as long as you study for them and pay attention in class. I got an A in her class and I would definitely take her class again if I could. Overall, I enjoyed her class","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjM4MTM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2002","date_posted":"2020-05-07 15:53:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Bolduc is so sweet and gives great feedback on everything. If youre willing to come to class and put in the work, the class really isnt a challenge. The tests were a little difficult, but the labs are done in groups and easily make up the test grades if you dont do too well on them!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjMwMDIx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISCI2002","date_posted":"2020-04-23 15:02:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Bolduc was really sweet and caring.

However, I dont think she is the best teacher to take for a science class. After our first test she said both of her classes had an average of only a C.

I took it during the summer, along with the other ISCI so it was a lot of work but I managed to get a B. I'm sure you can get an A during a full semester.

Just keeping up with your interactive notebook will get you a good grade. I took her over the summer so class was fast paced, but still easy. The test are multiple choice and short answer.
