She is very knowledgeable on the subject and definitely cares for the class to pass. She offers amazing extra credit-40 points, which brought my grade up so much. She lets you exempt the final if you have an A by the end of November which is great. She gets very mad if you leave class in the middle, but coming to her class ","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzMzMzEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SCI1101","date_posted":"2010-06-15 12:52:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor, especially for her first semester. Gave extra credit just for showing up on random days, up to 40 points, which immensely helped. She's pretty quick to answer email questions and pretty much knows what she's talking about. Didn't even buy the book and got a B, would have made an A if I'd studied.

First quiz is the most tricky. I would have had a 91% in the class if she dropped the lowest quiz. Study hard for the tests, they are not tricky if you take your time. Final was trickiest exam.
