He's a nice guy, pretty funny.  However (and this could just be because i am bad at science), his tests are very difficult and require lots of studying for even a B.  I couldn't even tell you how to get an A.  Good teacher, not an easy grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTk0Nzgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2014-12-11 16:17:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Frequently goes off topic on rants, especially about birds and his cars.

Be prepared to read the book, and study a lot. The tests are sort of hard, everything is multiple choice though. The labs are all online, and you only have to read through the basic information to pass the lab questions. Not hard, but not easy.

I only went to class on review and test days and simply copied down the powerpoint and didn't even look at the labs. I have gotten B's on both the tests by studying the night before.
