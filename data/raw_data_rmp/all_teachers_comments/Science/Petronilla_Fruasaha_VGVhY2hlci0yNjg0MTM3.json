There are 3 assignments per week on the day of your lab, pre-lab, in-lab, and Pearson HW. 3 lab exams and 3 supplemental assignments to help you prepare for them. It is not that much of a workload besides studying. Everything on the exams comes straight from the manual so study that and it's an easy A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzI4MzE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

Hard to understand lectures, but you won't be listening because there's an in-class quiz you'll have to do. 24hrs to do lengthy Pearson homework- no late submissions. No final but exam guides do NOT match with the exams. Because of COVID we only met 1hr per week to learn 14 weeks worth of material. Avoid and save your GPA.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Njc5ODQ2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
