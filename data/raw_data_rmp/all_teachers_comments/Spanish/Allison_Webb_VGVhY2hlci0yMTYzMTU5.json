If you took Spanish in high school, it helps, however the entire class is spoken in Spanish. She does however give plenty of examples for you to understand the language without using English. The tests and quizzes are somewhat difficult, however if you put in the time you'll be fine.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjQ4Mzc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

She does speak Spanish throughout the entirety of class, but its not as hard as it seems. I really like how she also teaches you about Spanish culture rather than just the language itself. Her projects are made so that its almost impossible to make a bad grade. Im very sad she doesn't teach 2001!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjM1MzQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1001","date_posted":"2017-05-12 21:46:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the meanest and rudest teachers I have ever had! Not only does she speak all spanish in a beginner spanish class, she won't explain it in english if you ask her for clarification. Extremely rude and wont help you if you ask for help.

Class had 35 at beginning, ended with 7 people.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4Mjk5Nzk2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":8,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
