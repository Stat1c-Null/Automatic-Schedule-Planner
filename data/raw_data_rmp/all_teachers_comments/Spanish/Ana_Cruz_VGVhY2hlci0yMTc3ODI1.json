I had a higher grade in college Spanish 2 than this class. She is a legal translator and expects perfection, moves fast. All the other students were failing and she was confused why. She is very nice and you can get an A just a miserable class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTI5Mzk3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

Professor Cruz is a great teacher, and she is willing to help if you ask. I took 5 years of Spanish prior to taking this class and learned lots. There are speaking assignments, but she's very helpful before and during the presentations. Would recommend, especially if you've never taken Spanish","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzQwMjEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN2001","date_posted":"2018-05-17 20:10:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really passionate about teaching and caring and knows her stuff.

She is the best Spanish teacher I've ever had as she really cares that you learn the language, has very clear lectures and knows the grammar very well. As long as you come to class and are engaged, she is very understanding and will work with you if you try. If you ask for help, she is there to give it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODc5Njc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1001","date_posted":"2016-12-15 13:49:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is extremely knowledgeable in the subject. Her accent can be slightly hard to understand at times, but you quickly get used to it. Her class does have online homework which was sometimes problematic due to technical issues.

It's obvious she's very passionate about teaching and if you come to class and pay attention you should get an A. If you need help and take the time to ask she is very caring to explain.
