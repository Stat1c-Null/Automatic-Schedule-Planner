Workload was a solid amount to keep me productive but not stressed. She always stops for questions. She can tell when you are genuinely trying to put in the effort. She always looks out for her class. She is so kind and I learned a lot. Would absolutely take her again. Wish I could take her for my entire Span minor.

After 2001 I was unsure what would be next as my entire class was in Spanish. Mrs. Kerber reviewed everything we needed to know, from the subjunctive to future tense, this class really helped me understand tenses and grammar and I did not feel afraid to speak, she is very supportive and helpful if you mess up.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTU1MDQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
