Attendance is required, but he definitely makes the class fun and interesting. He only speaks in Spanish for the upper level classes so you really have to pay attention. However, he IS REALLY understanding for just about any situation. He is now teaching in Michigan but i would definitely recommend his class!! :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDU5MzQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN2002","date_posted":"2009-05-25 20:17:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really nice and funny. Made an effort to incorporate culture into the class which made it more interesting.

He jokes around quite a bit and will make fun of you if you aren't focused. He is my favorite professor thusfar...I even signed up for his 2002/03 class because I like his teaching style.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTYxMjU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN2002","date_posted":"2008-06-28 15:53:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a decent Spanish instructor, but his communication style can make for a frustrating experience.  I found him to be difficult to talk to after class.  When I spoke to him about a grading question, he cut me off in mid-sentence and did not answer my question.  Too many group projects where a large % of grade is at stake in group work.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NjIwNjEz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN2002","date_posted":"2008-05-05 13:38:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome professor.
