If youre struggling with the content or the workload, dont hesitate to ask for help! Shes very understanding.

The work she gives isn't hard unless you purposely don't study the vocab and grammar needed for Spanish. Her accent is a little and it can be sometimes difficult to understand what she means, however, if you ask her to explain something she will do her best to do so. Definitely a great Spanish teacher.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzk4MzMz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1002","date_posted":"2020-01-03 02:41:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved her.
