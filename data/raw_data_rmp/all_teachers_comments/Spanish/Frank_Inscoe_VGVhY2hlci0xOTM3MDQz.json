There is a lot of online homework, but don't be intimidated by it. As long as you stay on top of it, it's totally manageable. He only gives a midterm and a final as tests but if you pay attention in class and do the homework you know what to expect. I would definitely take him again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NzAzMDUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1001","date_posted":"2016-03-16 14:04:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was such a good and caring teacher! You had to put in a little bit of work and effort, but if you did, he was more than willing to help you the rest of the way. I really wish he taught higher level classes so I could take him again!

He gave good examples when teaching something that he knew would be a little harder for us to understand. The lectures are always interesting and I was surprised that I enjoyed the class.

Manages to be in a good mood at 8 am, which makes the class interesting. The test are easy as long as you've done the assignments and go over the study guide he sends you.

It is only his first year at Kennesaw so he is new. He is younger,easy going, and makes class interesting. He aint bad to look at either. lol He did cancel a few classes but sent e-mails out informing the class about the upcoming cancellation.
