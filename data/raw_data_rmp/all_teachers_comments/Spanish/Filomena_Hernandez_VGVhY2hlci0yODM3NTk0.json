She teaches her students how to speak like a native Spanish speaker. She has lots of in-class participation which could save your grade if you fall behind and she makes the classroom fun and engaging. This class is great for active learners. Deserves a raise. No late work is accepted so be on time with assignments.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mjc5OTgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1101","date_posted":"2024-04-24 03:40:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"I beg you to never take a single one of this woman's classes. She assigned over 80 assignments, and she did not post grades until the last week of the class. She also rarely responds to your emails, and if she does, she outright refuses to give a straight answer. Her expectations for students is much higher than the expectations for herself.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjQ2ODg1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Beware of pop quizzes--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1101","date_posted":"2024-01-22 19:07:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a very good teacher and wanted her students to do the best that they possibly could. The only thing that I did not like was that she would go around the class and everyone had to answer multiple questions every day. We would also have to read off of her power point slides, but she is a VERY easy grader.
