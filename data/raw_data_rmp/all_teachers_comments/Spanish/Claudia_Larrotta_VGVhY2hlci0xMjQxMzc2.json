Though attendance is not mandatory, you will would not want to miss a class.

Suggestions to do something not on the syllabus are outright rejected, though. Cute, though, and maybe in a few years she will become more flexible and savvy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Njg2NTk0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN2002","date_posted":"2009-01-08 12:09:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Native Speaker--Her English is excellent though she speaks mostly Spanish is the 2002 class.  She is a great Spanish Professor especially if you are interested in learning the language.  She is tough and I feel like more years will season her with more wisdom in teaching...feel like she needs that to make her even better than she is.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzM5OTYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
