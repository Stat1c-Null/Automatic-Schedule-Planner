The book and online code is essential for the class. She refers to the book every class, and the homework is online. It was one of the best classes that I've taken at Kennesaw mostly because she really cares for her students. Thumbs up!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMzQ2NzAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1001","date_posted":"2014-04-08 16:18:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome teacher, would highly recommend, she loves her students gets to know your names and really wants to see you succeed.
