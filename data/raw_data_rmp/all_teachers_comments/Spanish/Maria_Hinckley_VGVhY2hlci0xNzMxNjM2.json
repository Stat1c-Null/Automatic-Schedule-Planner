But she's very lenient on accepting it late. There were 3 tests and they were all pretty easy and I got A's on all of them. The oral presentations were graded very leniently as well.

I took two semesters of Spanish in high school so i thought I'd do well but that wasn't the case. If it weren't for the homework i doubt i would've passed. The test where pretty difficult, and  when it came down to the oral presentations she was very lenient.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDQwOTkx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

The biggest issue was that she absolutely requires that you participate and speak in class. I have a stutter/anxiety and so that made this class absolutely awful, but i may be a unique case.

She assigns TONS of hw after each class that is busy work.  Other than that you only have 2 tests and 2-3 presentations. However, she is a complete pain  to deal with.

She was clear and had great sense of humor. She pushed me to study vocabulary since we had several pop quizzes.She assigned a lot of homework but it was helpful.

This was by far the worst professor I have had in Kennesaw. She is never clear with anything she says and and is extremely unorganized. She's not even easy to make matters worse!
