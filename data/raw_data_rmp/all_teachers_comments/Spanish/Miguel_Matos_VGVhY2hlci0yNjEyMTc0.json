There is a good amount of work, but it doesn't take long. The class is very organized. I would recommend having a little bit of prior knowledge in Spanish before taking this course.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDE0NTk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPANISH","date_posted":"2023-01-14 01:27:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took Spanish 2032 with Professor Matos & it was great. He is very kind & good with communication. The course is a lot of work (about 3-4 assignments per week), but not unmanageable, especially if you stay ahead of it. With Prof Matos, Span 2032 was great even online, which is saying a lot since I typically prefer in-person classes for Spanish.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzMyNTcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPANISH","date_posted":"2022-05-05 12:26:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Professor Matos for SPAN 2032. Very relaxed class with only two small assignments due per week (no assignments on test weeks). Can sometimes take a bit to grade assignments but always leaves good feedback when he does. You're allowed to use notes and the textbook for all assignments so it's a very stress free class!

One of the greatest at KSU. Very attentive and always responds to you within an hour. Great listener and provides very detailed instructions for every assignments. Also very reliable and easy to talk to. Doesn't grade hard and gives plenty of time to submit assignments.

He can be a bit vague/unclear sometimes, and some of his question on his quizzes/tests don't make sense. 2 assignments due each week, sometimes he'll add in a quiz/flipgrid due too.

His assignments arent difficult and group projects are enjoyable compared to other classes. He is there to teach you and help you out if your struggling and he definitely DOESNt make you feel that he is doing everything in his power to fail you.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzc4OTM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures--Hilarious--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
