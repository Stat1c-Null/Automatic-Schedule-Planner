Any time we had recommendations, she would listen and try to incorporate them. This course is difficult regardless of the teacher, but if I could re-do it, I would take her class again.

Extremely helpful and wishes for students to succeed.  Enthusiastic and her clarity makes a big difference.  Too lenient.  One table of students were very disrespectful throughout the semester.

Makes quizzes that are harder than tests. Will grade papers, but she never shows how your overall grade is. Very biased towards her students. If you're a brown noser then this is the class for you.
