She assigns a ridiculous amount of online homework and the tests are  tough as well. She is unclear about what she wants, but as long as you ask her VERY CLEARLY then you can usually get an answer out of her. Attendance and the book are mandatory. She speaks in spanish about 95% of the time.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzE0NDUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1001","date_posted":"2009-11-12 16:11:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is HORRIBLE. Her class is so disorganized and chaotic that no one ever had any idea what was going on, or when anything was due, because she is constantly changing dates and not explaining things. She also messes up everyone's grades constantly. She teaches like it was a 3rd grade course and gets angry if you don't act like a little kid.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzU4NzYw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1001","date_posted":"2009-04-07 17:33:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"She really wants you to learn Spanish and has a big interest in it.

Kinda old school. Pretty much all business but if you study and attend you should do OK. She has travelled the World and you learn more than just Spanish from her!  Don't expect this to be a pushover class because she expects you to work and learn. If you're lazy, don't bother. If you like Spanish she'll make you love it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTU3MTI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1102","date_posted":"2008-07-26 16:03:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"A complete waste of time. If you got her - drop her! You will not learn anything. Stay only if you don't have any interest in Spanish and you really enjoy being frustrated all semester.

My class started with nearly 20 students but after the first test it dropped to 7. She attempts to be nice at times but yells at students & gets mad easily.
