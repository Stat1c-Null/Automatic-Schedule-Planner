If you have a good background in Spanish, her class would be no problem, however if you don't have any, it would definitely be more of a challenge. Class isn't so much teaching the material, but rather reviewing the online lessons and homework. Lots of online assignments, each for a grade, but lenient with due dates.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODQxNzEw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1101","date_posted":"2016-05-25 02:48:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very caring lady, but for the love of God doesn't teach. The class was easy for those with a background in Spanish, but for someone like me,  (no previous Spanish experience), I struggled. TONS of online homework graded for accuracy. Hardly teaches about important stuff like syntax & sentence structure (just vocab). Not an easy A, but not a hard A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NjQ4NjIw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1101","date_posted":"2016-05-17 16:39:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Kindest professor I've ever had, but such a scatterbrain. Grading criteria for this class was  non-existent, & there were many times when we had no clue how much an assignment was worth or if it was even gonna be graded. She never really taught either (taught ourselves). If you try you'll make an A, but it'll come with a good deal of frustration.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTk5Njky","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1101","date_posted":"2016-05-16 21:01:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"All the reviews I've seen so far are spot-on. If there were an award for nicest professor at KSU, she would win it, hand down. However, she does not teach! She will just have us read some passages aloud in class, & then she'll say some stuff about the vocabulary. No quizzes at all, just tests and online hw.  Hw is ANNOYING, so she's lenient on it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTkxODQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1101","date_posted":"2016-05-15 16:23:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely sweet professor, & will accommodate your needs without hesitation. However, her teaching style is a bit frustrating because she doesn't really teach. That's why you should only take her if youve had a good amount of spanish before. Only then will it be an easy A. Otherwise if youre new to spanish and you take her, expect to work for an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTgwNDM5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1101","date_posted":"2016-05-14 00:28:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Probably the nicest professor I've ever had. That said, she doesn't really teach. She'll just say some stuff & will have you talk with a partner the rest of class. There's a good deal of online hw, and the program is so nitpicky on answers that it'll drive you crazy, so she pushed back a ton of due dates. Only take her if you've had spanish before.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTcxNTk0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1101","date_posted":"2016-05-13 11:29:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"VERY sweet lady, but doesnt know how to teach. Because of that, she is very lenient on due dates and such. If youve taken 2+ years of spanish and remember most of it, it's an easy A. If you've never taken spanish, do yourself a favor and take someone else. Also, the online he program is VERY problematic, so she will extend due dates for that a lot.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTY0ODE3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
