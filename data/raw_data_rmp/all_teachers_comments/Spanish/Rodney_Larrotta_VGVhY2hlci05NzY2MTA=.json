I have always struggled with foreign languages but he made the material very easy to learn. Show up and do your assignments and you will get an A. The actual class is very fun and engaging.

It was straight forward and to the point. He gives a lot of easy 100 assignments. Honestly, show up, listen, pass. He makes it so there's no way you won't do well unless you never come to class. Take him and you will be fine!

Lectures cover basic Spanish. Lots of class interaction, but it's fun.  Every time I looked at the grade distribution for a quiz everyone either got 100 or a 0. So just try, show up every class and you'll get an A. Tests count for 30%, final exam 20%, online packets 15%, group project 15%, participation 10%, and quizzes 10%.
