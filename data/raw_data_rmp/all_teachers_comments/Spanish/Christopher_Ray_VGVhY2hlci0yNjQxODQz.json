He's very nice and a friendly teacher but there was a lot of work and they are decently hard. Very time consuming, I ended up dropping this class because we had 9 assignments, a quiz, and a big project due in the same week.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTg3MTMy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Get ready to read","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SPAN1001","date_posted":"2021-06-08 20:52:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher! He's always willing to help and give feedback. The course work was a bit much if you aren't focused. Not too hard, just a bit annoying.

He has been one of the most caring, intelligent, and passionate professors I have ever taken. He truly cares about your learning experience and strives to make sure every student understands Spanish.
