He only speaks Spanish during class and moves very fast. You have to invest all of your time into his class to be successful. Expect hard tests that he will not look over, group work, and tons of homework.

Spanish is a difficult class but he helps a lot! Homework after every class, but do it. He will check sometimes and that can affect your grade. 4 in class essays but some are with a partner and you take it home to correct. Highly recommend!
