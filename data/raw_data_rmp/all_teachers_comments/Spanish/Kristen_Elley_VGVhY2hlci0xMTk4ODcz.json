This professor is awesome! Her class was really fun to attend, and you do a lot of in class stuff to reinforce the material.

I disagree with the last rating. She is &quot;easy&quot; because you understand the material due to her EXCELLENT teaching skills. I sucked at Spanish at first!

However, it's an easy A as long as you come to class and do the homework. I recommend taking at least spanish 1001 first if you haven't taken spanish before because she doesn't teach the basics.
