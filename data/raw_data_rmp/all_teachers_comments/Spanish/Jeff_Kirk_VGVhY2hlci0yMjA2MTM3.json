As long as you actually try you will do great. Prof. Kirk gives great feedback and the way homework is laid out makes it easy to keep up with. He is very understanding if you have got a lot going on in life.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzQ0MTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1001","date_posted":"2020-05-03 23:07:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"All homework is online and super easy, tests were front and back (not over the vocab just the grammar components of each chapter), group projects of talking, have to attend two cultural events on campus, extra credit if you sit at the Foreign Language department, lectures are fun and interactive, super funny and overall fun class.

He's got a good sense of humor and is easy to listen to. I do well in Spanish, so I didn't study too much.

Simply as that. He was the most understanding professor I have had, and he makes being involved in his class easy. The involvement really helped me learn, and I appreciate that. I also messed up and missed a few online deadlines, and he extended them multiple times for me. Take him if you are going to take Spanish 1","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTkzOTky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPANISH1001","date_posted":"2016-12-07 23:06:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the best professors I have ever had.
