You have to buy the book and the online access because you will use it a lot. As long as you do what she says and come to class you ill learn spanish with you really realizing how much you have learned!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjQ0NDI0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1102","date_posted":"2011-01-06 10:20:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Wikinson is a pretty good teacher. Having the book is a MUST because you use it every class without fail. Her tests are really easy and the board-made final is the same, easy. No cellphones or laptops, she hates those. DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Online is easy, but those written homework pieces are essential to your grade.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MDkwNjY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
