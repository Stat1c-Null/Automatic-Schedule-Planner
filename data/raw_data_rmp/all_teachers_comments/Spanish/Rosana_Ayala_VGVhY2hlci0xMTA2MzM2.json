Most of class time is spoken ONLY in Spanish-so be ready! She was sometimes unclear with due dates and what she wanted but overall she was fun, funny and helpful.

She uses a good mix of worksheets and book work! The online activities are tedious, but that is the case with any Spanish class. She is helpful and always works with you when you don't understand.

Ayala was a great help and kept the class engaged everyday. Keep up with all the hw assignments and activities and this class shouldn't be a burden. I didn't take Spanish since high school (5 years ago) and I made a B.

She is understanding, helpful, funny at times, and very easy as long as you put a little effort into studying.  The only negative is that she is somewhat all over the place with organization and dates.  We never quite knew exactly when our tests, quizzes, and homework was due.

I had no problem learning Spanish in her class. She is, however, quite disorganized and it's hard to keep track of what is due when.
