I do not think though that KSU should call this a &quot;Beginner&quot; level class.  I had no experience in Spanish at all and was completely overwhelmed and had to drop this class because it is taught in spanish. If you have no vocabulary in the lang. you cannot just step into this class.

He's real cool and down to earth and jokes at times. He made spanish fun..although the way he says &quot;exelente&quot; is sorta creepy o.O ..but besides that, he's nice and exams aren't too tough, just study and DO THE ONLINE H/W!!
