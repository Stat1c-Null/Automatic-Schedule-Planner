She is tons of fun and she will make you laugh a lot. Her tests are straight off the powerpoints she lectures from in class. Overall, an easy class with a really fun teacher!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODExNTM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2012-09-24 17:02:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take her!!! I'm super picky about teachers and this one is by far a winner. She's extremely helpful even if it doesn't have to do with her class and she's much more entertaining in class than other professors. She's kinda wacky in a good way and she likes to have fun. easy tests too as long as you skim the book reading.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNjU5NTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2011-11-14 10:43:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome teacher! Very interesting, keeps attention. Usually got to leave class early. Uses the textbook, a lot.

She is hilarious and an extremely good teacher!I would recommend her to anyone. She always says, &quot;If I could learn Spanish, so can you.&quot; She holds a weekly study group for anyone and is always available to give you extra help if you need it. Tests are tricky but they are like that bc of the department.
