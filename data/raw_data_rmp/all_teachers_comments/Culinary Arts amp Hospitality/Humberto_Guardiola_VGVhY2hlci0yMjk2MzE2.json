Since the class is so much more interactive than those just in a class, you really get to know everyone and he's a really friendly guy.

He makes the class fun and add lots of fun to the food recipes. He is very creative and passionate about food. Attendance is mandatory but if you can't make it to class, then you have to make it up by joining another class. He has the interest of his students at heart. Take his class!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODQ5NzI5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
