He gives NO grade justification and at times throughout the semester his knowledge and command of the subject(Safety) came into question. No matter how much you study or time you put into this class your chances for an A are very slim.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjY3MTY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
