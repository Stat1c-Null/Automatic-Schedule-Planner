His Construction Tech 1 class was very easy as long as long as you did the work.  I don't know why everyone was hating on him in the earlier RMP, he must have changed. He is really nice and caring. The class should be 1 credit not 3.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Mjk0MTQ0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3000","date_posted":"2009-11-30 21:21:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good teacher if you can keep up with him.
