Her quizzes are really hard (expects you to know everything like you work in the industry already) but her labs count for just as much so if you do them you'll be fine. Definitely come to class though bc you can't make up anything unless it's for a legit reason.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTE4Mjk5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

There is typically a 45 minute to 1hr lab after every class. Every lab is the EXACT same you look at the same drawings and specs over and over the only difference is you look at different trades. The tests are combination of the lectures and book and require a lot of studying to pass.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDUyMjY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM3810","date_posted":"2016-02-12 15:39:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"The only requirement to passing the class is showing up.
