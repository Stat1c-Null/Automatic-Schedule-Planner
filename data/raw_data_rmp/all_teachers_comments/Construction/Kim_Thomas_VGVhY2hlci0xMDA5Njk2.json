Someone that has never seen some of this stuff will be lost, lost, lost. She is nice, but very demanding. I appreciated that as I am not in school to be babied. That said, for a 2000 class, this is one of the hardest you will ever see.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MjkzOTAw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM2000","date_posted":"2009-05-12 08:55:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Too much work for just one class. Lots of homework and her tests are hard. She also picks her favorite students in the class and teaches only that side. The most annoying part is she has this annoying smiley face.

FYI, the workload increases dramatically AFTER the withdraw date. That's when everyone's grade dropped precipitously.

Just do what she tells you and it will work out in your favor.Also, she does not tell you everything, she makes us research for some of the topics that is given.

Don't be fooled.  This class is harder than it really should be.  Some things on the test were not taught in lectures.  She also contradicts the book, and does not tell you until after you get points deducted from your HW.
