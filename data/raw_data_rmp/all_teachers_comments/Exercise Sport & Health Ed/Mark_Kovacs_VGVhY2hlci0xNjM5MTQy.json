He allows students to work at own pace and allows you to do the labs at home which was great for me! Goes over general items that will be on test. Read the chapters and remember vocabulary you will do fine! Take advantage of extra credit, really helped my grade!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTk2ODY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2011-12-27 15:45:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was pretty easy. READ the research links because he puts questions on the exams. He's not exactly clear about everything that will be on the exam. If you read all the material and hand in projects you'll do fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NjI4MzEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1390","date_posted":"2011-11-08 00:10:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Former professional tennis player from AUSTRALIA.
