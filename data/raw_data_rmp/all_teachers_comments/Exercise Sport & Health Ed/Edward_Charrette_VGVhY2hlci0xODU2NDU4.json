He takes attendance every day but I skipped almost every lecture day and still got an A in the class. Just make sure you go whenever there are in class activities and read through the powerpoints thoroughly before each test. Coach Charrette is a very nice and understanding guy. I would recommend his class to anyone who still needs HPS.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTgwODM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2013-11-26 09:24:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not a hard class but very tedious. There are alot of assignments that need to be turned in. Test are harder than what you think. Class usually last about 30-40 min and skipping the chapter lecture days wont hurt you. Just make sure you actually study the ppt at home.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzkwNTk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
