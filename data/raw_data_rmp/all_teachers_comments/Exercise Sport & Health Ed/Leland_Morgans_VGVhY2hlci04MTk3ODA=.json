Many students complain that the tests were hard but only because they did not attend class and take notes. If you want an A, stick it out and take the notes. The tests come straight from the notes. If you do, the class is extremely easy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTQxNDQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS","date_posted":"2013-12-09 12:58:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take him, very monotoned, does not help at all, you end up falling asleep in the class or because his voice is so soft.
