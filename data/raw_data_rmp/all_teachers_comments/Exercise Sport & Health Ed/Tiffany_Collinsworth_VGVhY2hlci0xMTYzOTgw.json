The book is not required because everything is posted online, but it would be beneficial to get it. I would take her again if I had to take another HPS class!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MTk0OTQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2009-08-24 01:53:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took this over the summer. Very easy tests and labs, lectures and activity days weren't bad and she posts all power points online. There are a bunch of easy extra credit options to boost grade. Made an easy A without even doing the assigned 4 hrs of activity at the wellness center.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MTQ1NzY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2009-08-04 11:08:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fun teacher.

Tests came from handouts. There were two tests: midterm and final. Midterm was more difficult than final. Take notes in class for tests. Had labs and worked with older adults @ KSU and in field. Pretty easy class overall.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTA2NTEw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2009-04-01 14:03:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Sweet lady. As long as you're in class for tests and activity days, she doesn't take attendance. Labs take like 5 minutes. Easy A.

Her class was fairly easy if you did the work. Her tests were pretty much common since for the most part. She was fun! We did have to do a mile walk and a 1.5 mile run... but I think all HPS 1000 classes have to do that. I would definitely take her again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MTY4NDQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
