Four quizzes, 3 exams, one discussion, one written scenario worksheet. You could easily finish the whole class in one day. No lockdown browser, even she suggests to use the e-books while you are taking the quizzes and exams. No class meetings online either!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjY0NTg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES2200","date_posted":"2019-05-20 18:32:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took this over the summer as a Maymester. Although it says 4days/wk for 2 weeks we only met 3 days in total. She is very nice and caring. Makes the class feel comfortable. Highly recommend taking in summer because it is so easy. Can't imagine this class taking a whole semester. Only a handful of assignments and easy grader.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTE4NTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ES2300","date_posted":"2018-11-08 10:27:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super easy class. 1 quiz and 1 Assignment per week, total of 15 chapters . Everything is preloaded on D2L so you can work ahead. I finished the whole class in the first month. You need the book. 2 tests (1 midterm,1 final 100 Questions each).

She's very credible and knows her stuff. I think her class structure and organization could be better, but coaching swimming is life so I understand. As long as you do the assignments and you do not procrastinate, this class is an easy A.

I received an A in this class and it is very easy. However, I can't tell if shes being stubborn or geniuenly cannot calculate grades properly. Be forewarned this class is easy, but shes a very stubborn/slow grader.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjA3ODkw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HPS1000","date_posted":"2014-05-01 22:09:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super easy class.

Gives extra credit opportunities. Save everything so if there's a question about a grade, if you show her you did it she'll change your grade. Doesn't take late work. Only counts 3 exams so if you're happy with your grade before the final you don't have to take it. Class is kind of boring but mandatory.
