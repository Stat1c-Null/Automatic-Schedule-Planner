She understands we have a life outside of school and doesn't give too much work to do. She is very lenient, and gives good grades on assignments if you turn them in on time. I definitely recommend taking her. Her class is an easy A!

All of your tests are online and you take them at home. You really don't have to go to class because she doesn't take attendance and she puts everything up online for you to do. She gives clear instructions and is willing to answer your questions. By far the easiest teacher there is.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDE3MTQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
