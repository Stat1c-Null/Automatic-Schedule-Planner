He was the coordinator for my senior internship and it was an absolute joke. The class was extremely disorganized and getting in contact with him is impossible. Our class was not a priority to Calloway. I can't believe that we had to pay tuition to receive &quot;instruction&quot; from him.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzkyODgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SM2400","date_posted":"2013-12-20 19:02:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very talkative, but is very interesting.
