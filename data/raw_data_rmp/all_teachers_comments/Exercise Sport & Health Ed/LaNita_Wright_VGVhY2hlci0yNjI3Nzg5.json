She does not have a clear syllabus, it's extremely hard to understand and she does not explain anything accurately.  DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!!!!! During the summer , she expected 16-weeks course work completed in 4-weeks. I paid for the course; however, I did not learn too much from it. She is very unconcerned!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjY3MTI2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHE2400","date_posted":"2025-04-18 00:17:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shes an okay teacher be for lab assignments every week.

The syllabus is unreliable and confusing for knowing when certain assignments were due. Grades assignments SUPER last minute.

If you see a better professor go there. Amanda's really good. Attitude and antics took away from the class. Has favorite students and will let them turn in a quiz late or resubmit an assignment.
