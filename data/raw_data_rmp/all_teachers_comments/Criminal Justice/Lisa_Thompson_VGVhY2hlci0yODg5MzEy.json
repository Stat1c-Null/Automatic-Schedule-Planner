But she literally breaks down every aspect of the paper. It may be challenging if you have never written a lit review or annotated bibliography, but she grades very easily and helps so much. Seriously, if she is an option, take her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDMwNzg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2025-03-24 19:12:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"I left the class with a 114.

I had her 3 semesters in a row and she's always been great. I did struggle a bit in two of her classes due to personal issues, but she was very understanding and helped me out to the best of her ability.

There's many assignments but that means there's a lot of opportunities to get your grade up. She is very relatable and caring, responds to emails in depth and fast.
