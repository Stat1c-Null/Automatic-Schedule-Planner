She would never answer my emails and on the occasion that she would, she would give an attitude or answer in one or two words. Never graded work, even if it was turned in she'd mark it as missing and it was impossible to receive a grade because she won't answer emails.

I have always been an all A student. This course gave me my first B since middle school. Also, the textbook is DREADFUL. The assignments are okay, except the time where I had to read 15 articles only to answer like four questions. Lastly, nothing on D2L works.

Dr. Coto is an exemplary teacher who does not require textbooks and gives each module in easy, segmented pieces. There were essays due weekly, but this is COLLEGE, you HAVE to work to get your grade.
