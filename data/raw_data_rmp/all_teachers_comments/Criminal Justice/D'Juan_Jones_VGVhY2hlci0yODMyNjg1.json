He does NOT open the weekly modules in a timely manner AND if you email him to request that he open it, he opens it up and then emails you that it was ALREADY open. I took a screenshot of the module not open and then when he opened it after my email. He is arrogant and needs humbling.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjM2Mjg3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3315","date_posted":"2023-12-21 19:22:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you do poorly in his class, it is entirely your fault. Not the most accessible via email, but was not an issue whatsoever. Every quiz is open note, and all other assignments are almost entirely opinion-based. Incredibly relaxed. If you care more about an easygoing semester than a fulfilling one where you learn a ton, this is the guy for you.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzY4NjY4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
