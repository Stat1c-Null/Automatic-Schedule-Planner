I don't know yet if she will actually take points off for missing class, but she doesn't seem like she will. 3 grades - midterm, final, and a group presentation which is just presenting a chapter out of the book. Gives reviews straight from test questions. She also took us on a field trip to a YDC.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDkzODEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
