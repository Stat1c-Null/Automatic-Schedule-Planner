Grading was a little slow for my liking, but other than that, coursework was made easy by her and her great usage of videos for explanation.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODkyNzE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANTH3310","date_posted":"2012-11-12 15:09:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely wonderful! Everything is laid out for you and she makes herself available at any time to help - pretty lenient and understanding, too. She does take attendance, so go to class. Notes supplement the readings. A couple of participation grades, exams, and one research paper, which isn't at all difficult. Absolutely take her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE4MjAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI2201","date_posted":"2012-11-07 12:51:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a smart woman, very nice.  However, I hope my experience was not indicative of her typical class. We watched videos daily, the limited lecture was directly from the book.  I felt resentful knowing that someone could slap something down last minute for the same grade.  If you need something to offset a difficult schedule--here you go.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzkxODE1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU2105","date_posted":"2012-11-05 22:18:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely well organized and planned out for the entire course.

That said she was very clear and well prepared for every class, and she did not just teach straight out of the text but instead used supporting materials (mostly videos) to supplement the text. She was helpful in class but no office hours","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzQxMzkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
