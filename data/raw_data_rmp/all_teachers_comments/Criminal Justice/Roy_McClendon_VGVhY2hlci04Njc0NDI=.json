He is young and graduated from KSU, so he easily relates to all of us. As long as you go to class, he'll give you test questions and powerpoints. He's also VERY understanding if you ever need to make-up an assignment and also gives extra credit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjIzNDEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI4444","date_posted":"2007-10-03 15:53:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is no longer at KSU.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTA1MDkx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI4432","date_posted":"2007-07-29 13:15:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. McCLendon is a really nice guy. That said, I have never experienced such a disorganized class in my life. We ended up being graded on only one test, a group project, and a final (take home) because so many classes were cancelled. I was disappointed because the subject really interested me.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMzYyNTE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3342","date_posted":"2007-05-16 19:06:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Criminology class. Nice person, but he canceled more than half of the classes. Lectures were just average. We covered only 4 out of 15 chapters. Papers were never returned. I made an A, but feel like I need to retake the class to learn the material.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMTc1Njcw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101ONLINE","date_posted":"2006-07-20 11:50:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. McClendon is AWESOME!!! Very easy to get in touch with. Understands that emergencies CAN happen....TAKE HIM IF YOU WANT AN 'A'!!!! He won't just give it to you, but he gives you plenty of oppurtunity to earn it!!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMDkyMDg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
