All you have to do is attend class, read the book, answer simple questions for homework, do a short paper, and take the tests, which she lets you use your notes for. She also gives you the oppurtunity to get feedback on the tests after she gives them back. Her delivery can be confusing; she tells you what will be on test. 6","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTIzNDMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2012-12-10 18:27:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is terrible at teaching. She was the most unorganized professor I have ever dealt with. Our class did not follow the schedule that was listed in the syllabus. I had to make up a test because I had the flu and I had to wait on her for almost an hour because she was not in her office at the time she told me to come.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDExNzk0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2012-12-06 21:27:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have never been in a classroom that was this disorganized. She knows the material, but has no idea how to teach. She is condescending to anyone who tries to talk to her, and her lectures are 10 minutes worth of material surrounded by an hour of her telling the class how smart she is.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTc2NDUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2012-12-06 10:00:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is completely unorganized and she has a tendency to rant about things unrelated to the class.
