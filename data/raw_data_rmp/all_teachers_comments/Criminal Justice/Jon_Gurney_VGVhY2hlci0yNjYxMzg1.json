On the bright side, there were only 2 papers throughout the semester, and graded them pretty easily.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDg5MDQ5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2021-05-10 18:17:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class itself was really easy. You definitely have to read the textbook to pass the weekly quizzes, but it's not difficult. He takes forever to grade assignments though and communication is nonexistent.

The quizzes are relatively easy as long as you review the powerpoint and vocal, it just takes weeks to get grades back. He is not the best at communicating. If you want an easy A then take this course, just keep in mind you won't have grades back for weeks at a time.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDk4NTg0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CRJU3320","date_posted":"2021-03-17 22:56:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"For multiple weeks he has not posted quizzes on time and then blames us when we email him late about it. Even if he posts quizzes late, he keeps the original due date (sometimes we have a day instead of a few). The syllabus said we would receive grades 6 days after the due date and we don't. Other than this the class is easy w/ no other problems","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDQ3ODMy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
