There are a few quizzes and discussions post but as long as you do the work and really try you should be fine. I found the zoom calls she did really helpful.

She actually does nothing to teach you the material so youre actually just learning it yourself. VERY SLOW GRADER and merciless. I turned in somethings late and I got flat ZEROs on all those assignments. Super ruthless.

She is overwhelming our research methods class and I don't think she realizes it. 3 EXTREMELY detailed exams along with a double digit paged course paper that requires lengthy updates through the semester.
