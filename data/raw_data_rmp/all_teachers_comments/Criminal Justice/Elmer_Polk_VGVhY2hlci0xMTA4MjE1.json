The expectations are very easy as long as you try and follow directions. He is a very funny and personable man. I advise you to talk to him outside or after class because he truly cares about every single student.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDUzOTE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2009-07-25 17:30:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is the BEST professor at KSU. He is so great at teaching. He is also very approachable and he is so fun to talk to if you ever get the chance!

Make sure you study for test as they are 3hrs, but questions are in exact order of the book. Start your paper early and get it approved before you start writing it. He tells you up front what he expects from his students and really wants you to succeed in his classes.  I wish he taught more CRJU classes at KSU.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MTM4OTE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI4432","date_posted":"2008-08-01 11:01:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Heckuva nice guy. He's very entertaining, will work with you, and is always very accessible. His classroom lectures have a large dose of real world anecdotes that will frequently keep you entertained, even at 10:30 at night in the late classes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NzA2Njcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI4432","date_posted":"2008-05-09 14:18:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Polk very nice, very easy, and pretty interesting. Brings his background in criminal justice to the classroom and it is interesting and informative. I would recommend him to anyone for any class (CRJU, SOCI). He makes every effort to ensure that every student makes a A, and if they don't it is entirely their own fault!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NDM3ODY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3315","date_posted":"2008-03-06 00:37:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Polk is very low key and informative. He comes with  corrections/probation background (not in GA). This  class is not one of his favorites - he does cover the material briefly and reviews the basic &quot;need to know&quot; for future classes/career in CRJU. Tests from the book and class notes. Very nice and professional.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MTQzMzAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
