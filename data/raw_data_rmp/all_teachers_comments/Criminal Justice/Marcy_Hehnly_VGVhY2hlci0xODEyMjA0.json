Attendance is a must, miss more than 2 classes wo a valid excuse and you will fail . Make sure you have it when you return. Take notes because she don't post powerpoints Make marks in book as she go thru the slides and you will be fine. I aced her class with no problem.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjk3MTE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JUVDELINQ","date_posted":"2014-10-26 21:56:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Juvenile Delinquency in the Spring of 2014 and enjoyed it. Don't miss class because you failing depends on it. Never took her for online but I might. Funny and knowledgeable about material and has great connections for internship.

Take her class! She doesn't do tests, you take quizzes throughout the semester along with occasional assignments and a service learning project. She is funny and makes it easy to come to class. I took her 8am class and didnt want to miss a class! She is crazy but a good crazy!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjk2ODc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3352","date_posted":"2014-03-13 01:15:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had her for a friday class, She is awesome. Attendance is mandatory but if you talk to her you can get it excused. DON\"T BE LATE TO HER CLASS! she hates it when your late. She is a strong believer in community service so you will be doing a project in her class but it is fun and rewarding. She is my absolute favorite professor at Kennesaw State!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTA3NDc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3320","date_posted":"2013-11-06 11:52:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love taking Professor Hehnly. She is an awesome professor. Very engaging, loves what she does, has great stories, and you learn a lot in her classes. Read your textbook because the chapter tests come directly from the book. No midterm or final. Just tests over 3-4 chapters. She gets to know you by name and is all around awesome.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjY1NzA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3320","date_posted":"2013-11-04 16:05:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"BEST PROFESSOR KSU HAS! She is so funny & has so much knowledge about the CJ field. Took her for the first time this semester and loved her class.  Always kept class intresting and fun. Brought in great guest speakers, who gave awesome stories of first hand experience. I wish she taught every CJ class KSU offered. Never a dull moment in her class..","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjUzMjIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3311","date_posted":"2013-05-08 21:55:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Marcy is awesome!She brought a lot of real world experience to the table. Several m/c quizzes, a few group assignments, a few homework assignments, an administrator interview and paper. Don't worry, it seems like a lot, but it wasn't; everything was extremely easy. If you're not a good test taker, the other assignments will get you the grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzEyNzU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3352","date_posted":"2013-04-30 10:45:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!

She is a wealth of knowledge both book and in the field.  She makes class interesting with real life situations that she correlates to the readings. Take her you will not regret.  Many quizzes no major tests, group projects and a paper.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjAxOTYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
