Needs to lighten up a little.  I totally enjoyed the class when it came to the guest speakers but not when it came to his lectures.  He reads directly from powerpoints that are WAY too long and you must purchase the book or you will not do well on the tests.  He does grade on a curve.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTU5MDQx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2011-09-07 16:03:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice guy, not an actual professor; actually a federal prosecutor. He knows his stuff, may be a little too dependent on PowerPoints but as I mentioned he's not a teacher. Take notes and pay attention to his guest lecturers (it's not hard, most of the ones he picks will be entertaining...more so than him)","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4OTg0MTEy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
