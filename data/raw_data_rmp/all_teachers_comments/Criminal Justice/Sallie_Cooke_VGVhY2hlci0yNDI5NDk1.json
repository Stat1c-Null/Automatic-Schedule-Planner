Shes very passionate about the field and I learned a lot from her this year. You will have to put in the work but its worth it you get a lot out of the class. Hope I get to take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjgyNzM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3300","date_posted":"2018-12-06 13:47:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awful. Takes forever to take attendance which doesnt work in your favors towards the grade. She also popcorn reads all PowerPoints. You will have to teach yourself everything because she isnt knowledgeable about the subject.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODk0MDY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
