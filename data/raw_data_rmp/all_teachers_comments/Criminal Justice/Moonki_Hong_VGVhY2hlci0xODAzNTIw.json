He was not familiar with the subject matter he was trying to teach, victimology. He couldn't answer questions on why his slides contained information that was contradictory to the book. He did not even know what the Bill of Rights were! That is ridiculous since he was teaching a Criminal Justice class.

Useless as an instructor and not dedicated in any way to helping students succeed in course. He cancelled at least 8 classes and now we are trying to move on with Dr. Petersen as a fill-in for the remainder of the semester.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDgzNzk4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
