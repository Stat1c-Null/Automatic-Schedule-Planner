There was a lot of quizzes and feedback, but they're really easy. There were also 4 discussion posts and as long as you follow the criteria, you'll be fine. He has another job, so he wasn't too focused on this class which made for easy grading.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDIzNDMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
