Her lectures were engaging and interesting. Even when we went off topic, I always left with more knowledge than I came in with.

Her online class consists of weekly discussion posts and quizzes that are easy and manageable. Plenty of time given for midterm and final and one easy paper required. She is caring and understanding. (I took her during the COVID-19 pandemic and she was so encouraging and validating). What a deserving professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjA3NzE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
