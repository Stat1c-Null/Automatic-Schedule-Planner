[{"class":"CRJU3310","date_posted":"2016-05-10 16:30:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy A class. Does not teach anything and rambles with stories. However, he gives an exam review and gives you about a little more than half of the questions on the exams. In order to pass exams, read the book. Curves the exam and gives extra credit on exams! Attendance is added to final avg for extra credit. Grade is made up of final and midterm.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTI4OTU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU2105","date_posted":"2015-11-19 13:12:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Ballard is a sweet older gentleman. He is a retired police officer, he loves telling cop stories which are quite funny and interesting. He does not follow the book in his lectures, but the tests he gives (3 total) cover chapters in the book which he assigns to you to read. He is a fair grader. You will also write an essay at the end of term","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NDUxODQw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU2105","date_posted":"2015-05-06 21:19:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"His tests are easy and you only have tests and a paper, which is also easy.

Professor Ballard is awesome. He is just a sweet old man who loves to tell cop stories. Only 3 tests and one paper the entire semester, and thats IT. No other homework. He literally goes over the test the class before, so you pretty much have to try to fail.  Class isn't mandatory, but I actually enjoyed it when I did go.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzI5MDMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU2105","date_posted":"2014-11-02 15:22:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Ballard is an amazing professor! He is a good'ol boy and former cop! He loves to teach, you can tell, and he will ALWAYS answer your questions even if it means he has to go home and look it up next class you can be sure he will have the answer for you.  The textbook was biased but very interesting perspective wise.  Highly recommended!

His lectures don't really follow the book but they are intersesting. We had three exams and a two page paper. One page extra credit papers were optional.  For the review sessions, he literally read the test to us and gave us the answers. Easy A if you go to the reviews.
