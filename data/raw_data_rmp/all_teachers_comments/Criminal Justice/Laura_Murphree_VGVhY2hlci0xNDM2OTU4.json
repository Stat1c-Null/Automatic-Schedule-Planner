Very easy class. Is a prosecutor uses it to make her seem she knows everything but not really smart when a student says something and she re-words the same thing to make the student look like they don't know what they're talking about. Really boring overall.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzE1ODY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3315","date_posted":"2010-05-19 08:34:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ms. Murphree is a prosecutor and knows her stuff; very sharp lady. She has real world knowledge on courtroom and criminal procedure. The class is worth the drive to Paulding; we always finished up early. Very easy class; you?ll have no problem pulling an A. The lecture is provided a couple days in advance. I wish she taught other CJ classes.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjMyMzc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
