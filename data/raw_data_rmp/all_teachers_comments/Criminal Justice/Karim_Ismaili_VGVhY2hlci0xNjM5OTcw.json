You have to show up for class though or you will not have the notes you need to study.

He only gives two assignments, both are tests worth 50% of your grade each.  He discusses everything that will be on the test in his lectures.  If you take notes and come to class you won't even have to read the book.  Overall, a great teacher and an easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjU5ODMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2012-04-22 21:49:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"only gives two assignments- the final and midterm. does mostly lectures, and gets most info from experience and the book. tests are short answer, and comprise entire grade. he likes discussion, but not always clear to beginner cj students. i wouldn't take him again, but he was tolerable. should take him if you have cj interests.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDk3NTEx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
