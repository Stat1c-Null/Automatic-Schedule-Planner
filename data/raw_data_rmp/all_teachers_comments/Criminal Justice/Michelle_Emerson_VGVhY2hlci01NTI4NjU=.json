Lots of work, but there is no sense of instruction or guidance in the course. You can learn it yourself using the textbook, but it is very detailed with lots of statistics and studies.

Each week we had a two page reflection paper due on top of a discussion post. For the discussion post she had a requirement that you post two days before the due date which I personally hated.

It was an all online class. Just do all the assignments in one day and have the rest of the week off!
