I feel as if she sometimes graded harder than need be on certain assignments, but I still received a good grade overall. She's not easy to get into contact with, and term paper for the class lacks an appropriate rubric.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDE1Mzc3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SOCI1101","date_posted":"2016-12-13 12:03:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super easy course. Weekly discussion post with all the information in the book and simple weekly internet activity. One midterm and one final, two quizzes. All online. If you can keep up with the work, it is an easy a.

Questions on tests are extremely specific. You have to have the book-alot of reading. Many essay questions.  A paper a week (on each chapter) and weekly discussions.  Not very quick response time on questions and not exactly clear on feedback for tests. Very interesting subject loved the book, just hard to keep up.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDQ3NTQy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CRJ4430","date_posted":"2016-05-10 18:47:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her for vicrimiology my first online class! I done better than I expected. The class wsd easy, just tons of work but its very easy. 12 assignments and discussions, one peoject with essay. 2 test . you learn a lot from reading the book, assignments and classmates. This class was much more in depth than going to a classroom.

Lewis is an easy grader, but her class is not very stimulating nor interesting. The online class is very tedious and you need to be disciplined in order to do well. Weekly 2-3 page papers, weekly discussion posts and a mid-term and a final, both essay, and 10 questions each.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjcwMTM0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SOCI3360","date_posted":"2012-04-30 21:32:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lewis is an exceptional professor.  I have taken two of her classes now and have learned more from her teaching style then I have from some of the in class courses.  Yes it is an online class so you have to read and write papers - come on if you don't want to work for your grade then don't take her class.

I took two classes with her and I learned a lot. Weekly quiz, discussion, and assignment. She also has a final and midterm but it is not bad at all. She is very laid back and cool. Hands down she is better than all CJ or Sociology profs at KSU.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjI0NjI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJ4430","date_posted":"2011-11-13 00:09:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Emerson is a passionate teacher and she cares for all of her students.
