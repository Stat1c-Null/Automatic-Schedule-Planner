I'd email him questions for nearly every assignment and it was tedious. When there was a rubric, it was sometimes hidden in another module or in the syllabus. Still, would take again and the class material was engaging enough. Final research proposal, no final.

The instructions are very vague and grading is harsh. There is harsh feedback when it comes to the papers but not much direction. Most of the time the instructions were confusing.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTg2NTk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3301","date_posted":"2022-10-26 23:03:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took this course online and it was very boring. His instructions for papers are broad and vague, but he's a tough grader and leaves little feedback. His lectures were boring- I skimmed over the chapters instead.

He is extremely kind and you can tell he tries to make the class as interesting as it can be.
