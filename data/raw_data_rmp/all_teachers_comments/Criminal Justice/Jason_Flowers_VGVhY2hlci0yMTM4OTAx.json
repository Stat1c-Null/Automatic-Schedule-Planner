Be active and take part in class discussion and you will ACE this class easily. 3 test in total and that including the midterm and final, 1 \"leader\" interview with a short analysis of it and a small group presentation. Test are all online. Book is advised for the test only.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDY1Njcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
