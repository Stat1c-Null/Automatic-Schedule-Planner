Weekly quizzes, discussions, and MC/essay question midterm and final (open-book), and easy 7-8 pg. research paper if you plan ahead. Prof VZ responds promptly, is supportive, and an easy grader (adds EC to exams). Content is actually interesting and thought-provoking! Easy A, would definitely recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDY5Mjcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Amazing lectures--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU4305","date_posted":"2019-05-08 00:31:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Seems that a lot of people dont like him because they failed to read the instructions or didnt follow them. Only assignments are weekly discuissions that are pulled right from the book, final/midterm and a project he made optional. Read the syllabus and put a tiny amount of effort and you will get an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODA0MjYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU4305","date_posted":"2019-04-08 14:04:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"You would be better off taking another professor. Although there is a grading outline in the syllabus, you can initially expect to get a lower grade based off of criteria that is not posted in the syllabus. Other than that, there are 200-word long weekly discussions, a midterm and a final where students pick questions and write a page on them.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNTQ4NTEz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
