There are the usual amount of tests, need the book to study vocab, posts powerpoints, gives opportunities for extra credit, and one group assignment. Knows his material. Attendance is a must if you expect to start with an \"A\". Miss more than 2 classes and you drop a letter grade","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjk4MzA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3310","date_posted":"2014-05-02 19:47:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor was very knowledgeable about the material. You must study and come to class. Pass all paper and exams to be able to walk about the class with a decent passing grade. Loved his jokes. He was pretty cool, but if you’re looking for an easy professor please don’t take him. But if you want to learn then he is your guy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTUyMjg2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3310","date_posted":"2014-04-19 13:19:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"4 papers, 3 exams, final, presentation, and attendance grade. Worst paper grader ever. Horrible at returning graded items and posting needed materials online. Tests were good if you studied. He knew his stuff but overall I would not take him again. Also seemed like he had favorites.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDYzMjIy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3310","date_posted":"2014-04-18 19:10:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would not recommend taking this professor. He is very boring and very dry. He is also not very clear about what he wants for his papers. Three tests, 4 papers, and a final.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDYxMzIy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
