This is the kind of teacher I wish I had for every class-fun, makes class very interesting and really wants her students to do well. She knows how to make even the driest material funny so that you remember it. Gives extra credit opportunities. Tests are very clear and fair. She's terrific!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTczMjQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2008-11-04 21:21:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher is awesome.

She made the class easier, but she didn't just powerpoint the book, she added to it.  It was a fun class, and I loved the teaching style.

All of the powerpoints were online, although she gives extra credit for attendance sometimes. She's very flexible and understanding if you work/have issues to deal with. Kind of annoying sometimes. She's new and you can tell, she's not very knowledgable on the subject, but if you're just looking for a grade, I'd say take Ballard.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzODY5NzI4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRIMJ1101","date_posted":"2007-11-13 12:19:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's awesome! :) great teacher--flexible and willing to work with you. she's new to teaching, but she's easy to understnad. reads straight from the power points and has a study guide for each test with the exact info on the test. tests are pretty easy for the most part. all multiple choice and she gives extra credit once in a while! :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNjQzNzMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
