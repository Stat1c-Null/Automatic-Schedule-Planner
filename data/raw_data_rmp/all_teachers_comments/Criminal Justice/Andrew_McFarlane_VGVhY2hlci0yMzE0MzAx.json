Discussion post weekly, which he graded hard &amp; didn't give full credit unless you responded to 3 people but his syllabus says respond to 2. Had to do a ride along &amp; write a paper about it, which was fun &amp; easy. Lightened up by the end of the semester. Nice guy in person but the opposite for online class","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjUxOTYy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CRJU3332","date_posted":"2018-05-08 11:29:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. McFarlane's course was somewhat challenging because of the amount of work each week (a lot of reading, one long test with essay questions and essay-like DB posts). However, the material isn't too challenging. He is also very helpful if you fall behind or need guidance. I took him for an elective but actually ended up learning a lot.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDIyNzAz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU43053","date_posted":"2018-05-05 19:46:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"This online class was great. Very few discussion boards, and it wasn't mandatory to reply to other students. However, once the discussion board was done, it disappeared, so I highly suggest saving all your discussion boards in a word document (they'll come in handy later). The tests were 4-6 questions that you'd have all week to work on.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTk3NzA2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3320","date_posted":"2018-04-25 16:44:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took Professor McFarlane for Criminal Investigation and I'd recommend that you do the same if you need a GPA boost. Attendance is not mandatory and EVERYTHING was online except for one or two in-class discussions. By the end of the semester, maybe 1/3 of the class showed up consistently and some days he only lectured for 30 minutes","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODkzMjAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRCJ3310","date_posted":"2017-12-21 18:59:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is by far the best professor ive taken at KSU!
