He's an old school professor. He lectures and you take a test. He gives reviews and it's up to you to study.

His paper is difficult to get a good grade on considering the considering the level of expectation that he wants in it. He is a powerpoint head and reads strictly off of it and goes fast.

His tests are easy, his papers are impossible due to his stringent grading on grammar and such. All his presentations are the same, b&w power point that is repetitive, boring, and nothing to do with the reading. You will regret taking this professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMDYyOTQy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2006-12-13 09:38:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"This has got to be the worst teacher i've ever had. He's boring, and he picks favorites. Also, he's grammatically impaired and takes it out on you on your essay. I got points off on my essay for doing MLA correctly! I ended up getting an F on the essay, because he has an apparent inability to read and will ignore complete portions of your paper..:(","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNTg5NDE4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CJ1101","date_posted":"2006-12-04 14:54:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"As a cop, I'm sure he does a wonderful job, but as a professor its another story.  His lack of available communication channels is a problem, he only lists an email address on the syllabus.  He never cites the text book, but instead provides his only material without revealing the sources.  The class is boring, especially in the morning.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNTE1OTcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU1101","date_posted":"2005-12-28 12:58:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"As cuddly as a wet blanket and as exciting as dry toast.  I've seen more personality in an oil painting.  You will NOT be able to stay awake for long! The class was sorta easy, but so boring you'll want to rip your flesh off just to stay awake.
