He never post anything you basically get all your assignments on the syllabus and have to keep up with everything. Test not multiple choice! The way he sets up D2L doesn't let you know when anything is due so its easy to miss a date. Requires a court room observation paper where you actually have to go and observe.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDAyNjgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CRJU3400","date_posted":"2012-09-10 14:05:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Marks is very accommodating if you make an effort in his class.

Marks will not tell you what questions will be on his test; he says read and comprehend the book.  He checks and makes sure the entire class read the assignment every day.

If you are going to say bad things about him, tell the whole truth.  That test was written in APA format, and it was word-for-word from the book.
