COMUNICATE with him, he is there to help and guide and even puts in the effort to reach out to you as well. He also provides feedback, weekly discussions too.

He is super sweet and funny. His lectures are basically discussion based. However, this is not a class where you will learn in class and you will have to read the textbook and the powerpoints to learn for yourself. Easy A for minor or elective, but not best choice if you need to actually learn it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTQxMTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR4305","date_posted":"2021-05-11 16:16:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Brown is kind and truly cares about his students.
