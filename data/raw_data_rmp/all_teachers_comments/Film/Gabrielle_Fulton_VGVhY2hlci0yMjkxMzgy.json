I've taken several writing courses, and feedback is a must in any of them. In this class, however, none of our assignments were graded in a timely fashion, the teacher hardly responded to emails, and she did not give any feedback on our writing, which is a shame for serious writers.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDcwNDMy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"FILM3105","date_posted":"2021-05-14 01:52:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"This could have been a great class but Professor Fulton was ABSENT well into past the mid-term. She was HORRIBLE returning emails. No one really knew how they were doing in this class (no grades) with just barely 3 weeks left in the semester, it was VERY BAD. We (students) self taught ourselves. Probably one of the most STRESSFUL classes for me.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Nzg5NzU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"FILM3105","date_posted":"2021-03-16 19:25:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this is an asynchronous online course because of COVID. I was excited to take it because of Professor Fulton's experience. However, she does not post grades, respond to emails, or provide feedback on assignments.

Felt like she didn't like me and forgot to open one of the assignments (very stressful esp since nobody could get ahold of her, which made sense because we were on break).

She is rude, unreasonable and will not help you at all. It is November and I still do not have a single grade online or on paper.
