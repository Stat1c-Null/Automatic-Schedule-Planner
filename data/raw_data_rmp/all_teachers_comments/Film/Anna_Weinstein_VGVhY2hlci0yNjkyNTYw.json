You spend the semester writing a pilot script, watching popular TV pilots to analyze what can work in your pilot script, and there are in-class table reads of your script by classmates. She gives great feedback on your script/idea, grades fairly, and genuinely cares about all the students.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDMzNTgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FILM3105","date_posted":"2023-08-05 05:12:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"shes really cool and down to earth. had her for summer on zoom. required cameras on and mic. you just read some famous movie scripts, watched a couple of movies then take a quiz on them. \n-you write your own script. honestly pretty easy. the class acts out your script such a cool feeling tbh \n\ntake her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTQ1Nzcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FILM3105","date_posted":"2023-07-27 18:58:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Professor Weinstein a few semesters ago and have not forgotten her excellent feedback and lectures.
