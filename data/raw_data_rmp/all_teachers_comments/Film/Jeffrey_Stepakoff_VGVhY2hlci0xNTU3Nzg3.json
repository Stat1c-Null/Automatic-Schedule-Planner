I found him very arrogant, private schools/university, worked in Hollywood, blah, blah. Name drop, name drop.  He \"played\" to certain students, ignored the other ones, physically turning his back and talking only to certain ones.  I don't get this \"hot\" factor.  Where?

VERY knowledgeable on the craft. He has a lot of experience, he's worked on a number of TV shows, he knows the business. I didn't even do the online discussions, and still got an A.

Granted, it's an easy A. It's cool he worked on Dawson's Creek, but really, once you get past being star struck, you realize, he's not very good at teaching you the craft. Take him for an easy A, but don't expect to learn much. I was really dissappointed in him. He also seemed quite arrogant.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjIwNTk4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PRWR6490","date_posted":"2011-12-21 13:45:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Stepakoff is amazing. He is very enthusiastic about his subject and has a lot of successful experience in the Screen Writing field. He was co'-exec producer and writer of DawsonÂ´sCreek.
