There is no text so you do have to print out all the articles but you can use them on tests! Dr. Kim gives out extra credit opportunities &amp; tries to be fair when she can be. You NEED to work for an A but it is possible!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTI4MTkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

There was a midterm, a group project/paper, and our final was a paper. We didn't have a textbook but we did have to print out ALL of our readings from D2L and buy 2 books. She also lacks clarity when explaining assignments, so clarify with her what is expected.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjY1MjAz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2017-05-03 11:36:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is new to teaching so she is still working on things, but you have to attend class or you will loose a lot of points. Makes you print off very long readings and buy 2 novels. She makes you talk or read in front of the class. She makes you work with partners often. There is a group project (paper), pop quizzes, a midterm and a final paper.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTk2NTUy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"AS1001","date_posted":"2016-12-05 19:56:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a nice lady. She does do random pop quizzes. She does also makes you print out tons of articles (over 30 pages) so keep that in mind. Lectures are long and hard to pay attention. Group projects happen and you do have to write papers with your group members . I should have thought more wisely than to take this class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzQxMjMw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
