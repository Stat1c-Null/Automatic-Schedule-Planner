Course does require $120 online book key (though book itself not necessary), one hour per week in lab AND an hour per week in conversation, so be prepared for more than a 3hr course","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDQwODAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SPAN1002001","date_posted":"2013-11-22 08:52:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"She comes off at first really stern, but she is very willing to work with you if you don't give her any problems. She uses as much class time as she can, but you aren't sitting there listening to her lecture all day. The homework site code is $120. :( On the other hand, that's the only downside. Awesome teacher.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzcwOTUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
