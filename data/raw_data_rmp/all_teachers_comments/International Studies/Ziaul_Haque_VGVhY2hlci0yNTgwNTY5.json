He responds to emails and gives feedback. Also, very understanding. The exams are on lockdown. Study best you can because he doesnt provide a study guide, so read the e-lectures. Hes flexible!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTk0MTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Accessible outside class--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2021-07-07 23:30:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this class! This class consisted of 10 dp, a concept map, 3 reading assignments, 1 group project, a midterm and a final. The mid and final are easy if you READ THE BOOK and participate. The DP topics were never boring and our assigned readings were quite interesting. Prof was always willing to answer questions.

He has a clear grading outline. We have a different assignment ONCE a week. Either a discussion post, paper, or group project. There was also a midterm &amp;&amp; final. You have to respond to two people with discussion post.
