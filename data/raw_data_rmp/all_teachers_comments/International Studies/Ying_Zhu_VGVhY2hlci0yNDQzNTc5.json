This is not a pure art history class. The tests are very unclear. As an example, a question on a midterm test was simply \"hinduism\". The class is really confusing and not just history.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTc5NzY5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ASIA4517","date_posted":"2023-05-05 17:58:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very hard.

All of here assignment guidelines feel like a scavenger hunt. Her layout of content on D2L is so messy. She never grades anything but still gives feedback??? In her feedback, she also makes you feel like your work isn't good enough. DO NOT TAKE also uses lockdown browser with webcam...\nI took ARH3000","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzI1NDMx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ASIA4517","date_posted":"2023-04-18 22:40:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Zhu is so sweet & you can tell she enjoys teaching this subject. There have been miscommunications regarding the assignments when explaining it to the class. There have often been confusions about grading, submissions, online meeting times and project criteria. This class is very lecture heavy & graded by few submissions.

However her instructions are always vague, whether in part by English being her second language or something else. She means well but her power points are lack luster and she tends to use five different vocab terms for the same thing, creating a lot of confusion. She also never enters grades.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDE2NDQw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
