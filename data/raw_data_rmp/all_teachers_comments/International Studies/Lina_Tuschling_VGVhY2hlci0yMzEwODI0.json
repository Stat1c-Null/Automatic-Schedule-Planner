Gives lots of extra credit. Reading is recommended not really mandatory. You can choose your grading scale. Overall easy fun class 10/10 would take again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODEwOTky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"POLS2250","date_posted":"2017-12-03 21:41:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Tuschling was bomb, wish I could take her again. The reading quizzes were hard and the Statecraft simulation we had to do definitely took work for everyone but it was all good in the end. Attendance required. Students can choose weights of hw/tests/participation. Overall a reasonable class structure and a super cool teacher :) love u lina","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDI3NDEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
