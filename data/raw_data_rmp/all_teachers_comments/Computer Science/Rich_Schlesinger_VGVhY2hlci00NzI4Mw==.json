At times he seems pretentious and agitated when you don't understand assignments but he's willing to help. You just have to make sure he knows you're having trouble. Do assignments exactly as they say.

He yells at students if he thinks they are not paying attention. That being said, his class is straightforward and he gives you everything you need to do the labs and homework.
