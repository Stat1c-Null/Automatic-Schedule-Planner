I very, very, very highly recommend taking him if you can. Even if you don't need what he is offering, just sign up for his class so you can see what a great teacher is is.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTU2MTQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3424","date_posted":"2009-12-14 23:49:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"he is a great teacher my favorite so far at this school. explains material very well and post all his lectures online where you can listen in class instead of write as fast as possible. if you dont understand something he is always willing to help you outside of class. he is also just a really nice guy","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTU1Nzg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4363","date_posted":"2009-08-05 08:35:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"He loves what he teaches and has a way of communicating that make students comfortable. The Graphics class is tough, but very interesting with some fun projects. He responses promptly to emails and wants you to learn the subject. His tests are short essay, so you must read the book and pay attention.

However, you have to study hard on the test and do well on the homework assignments if you wanna do well because you can't just breeze by with him. I give him a 5/5","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NzQ4NzU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4353","date_posted":"2009-05-01 15:22:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"A great teacher!  I had him for Gaming Development and Design.  He's very clear in what he teaches and all of the class discussions were relevant to the course subject.

Takes excessive measures to keep tabs on students and make sure they understand, constantly worries that he's going to fast and asks for feedback. Best. Professor.

Uses what he teaches in projects that have real applications. Does not use multiple choice tests, but lets you write out what you've learned.
