If you teach yourself the homework and understand it, you will do very well on the quizzes and the test. He is also very lenient with grading, and let me make homework corrections to earn credit back. Very nice guy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjQzNjIz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4720","date_posted":"2020-05-13 19:45:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class had boring lectures and interesting material. Lineate grading but sometimes unclear criteria. Li is a very understanding professor and is willing to help. Sometimes he is hard to understand because of his accent. Be prepared for a lot of individual research and studying for your assignments because the class doesn't always cover fully.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjg2Njc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3503","date_posted":"2019-12-12 00:57:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Li has a stronger accent but he really knows what he is talking about. The grading is pretty straightfoward as you have 6 quizes, 6 homeworks, and 3 test. The test are extremely similar to the quizzes/hw and on top of that he lets you use a cheat sheet on all the tests which was nice. No textbook use either. Pay attention and its an easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjE5MTgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3503","date_posted":"2019-11-11 22:42:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor, accent is very heavy but don't let that discourage you. Grading scale is amazing, there are no finals just 2 test and homework and pop quiz. He does allow a 1 page cheat sheet front and back. Gives you a heads up on what will be on the quiz. Great class, no extra added stress nor anxiety. Show up, do the HW, and do well on quizzes","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzk0NDgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3503","date_posted":"2019-10-11 02:56:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"The way he covers content is ok. His accent can be a bit of an issue to get around, but this should not discern you from taking the professor. He does his best to explain the topics in class that will eventually apply to the lab and his tests. He lets you directly know what will and will not be on the tests, and he has some random quizzes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMjc4Mjg4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
