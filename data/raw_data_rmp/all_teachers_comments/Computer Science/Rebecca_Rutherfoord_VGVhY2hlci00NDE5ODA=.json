Read the chapters before lecture if you want to understand what is going on.  Tests are matching and lots of fill-in-the-blanks.  She will scare the class with the first test, but the rest are much easier.  Turn the assignments in on time to get 100's.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMTkxODk5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT4333","date_posted":"2006-07-16 14:32:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great teacher, really knows her stuff.  She gives you a review before each test and its pretty much the exact test.  Tests are short answer but if you study the review and know that you'll get a solid A.

I'd definitely recommend her as a teacher.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMDgxOTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3124","date_posted":"2005-12-15 23:09:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hardware/Software Concepts.
