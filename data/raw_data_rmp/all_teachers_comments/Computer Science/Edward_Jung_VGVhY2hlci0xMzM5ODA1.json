One of the best professors I ever had. You will actually learn a lot of things from his class. If you want to get A with minimum effort , please choose other professor. I prefer to get B instead of learning nothing.

His tests are challenging and you will take the full time to finish. Easily accessible via email, and will work with you until you understand.

Class assignments were posted on the fly with due dates that were often unreasonable. Class has no pre-req's yet you must know C++. The professor doesn't know C++ and will send you to the lab if you have questions. Tests are essay style so that he can curve the grade as he sees fit. Work hard pass and learn nothing.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTE1MDc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS6027","date_posted":"2015-12-11 12:44:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Jung is tough, but you will enjoy his lectures... he is not dull.

Excellent class, but not easy.  The labs tend to be above the level of comprehension that the course will give you, but the tests are on concepts and if you get it you'll do well.

He is awesome, explaining concepts very clearly. Has an accent, but who doesn't?? He speaks perfect English. Quizzes are easy enough to get a passing grade. You have to go over his learning modules.
