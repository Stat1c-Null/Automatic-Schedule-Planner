However, she is nice and willing to help. She provides lectures and PowerPoints regularly. There are weekly quizzes and easy labs, three open-book exams, and five extra-credit write-ups. The textbook is required but interesting. It's an easy A!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjA3MjM4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2019-05-10 08:35:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took her class online.
