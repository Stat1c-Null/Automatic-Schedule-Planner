He is friendly, cooperative, and willing to slow down lecture if you can't understand. He does present a language barrier in class, but will slow down if you don't understand.

Very forgiving, says he won't let you make up assignments (but he will). He's very generous on the tests. The quizzes can all be found in the back of the book, so study the &quot;Tests&quot; written in the back of the book.

Don't expect hand-holding, this is a participation class. You are supposed to use your intuition and read specs, he is simply the guide to the specs.

His accent is too strong and his teaching does not flow. It's actually easier to skip class and try and teach the material yourself. The labs are not hard if you start on it before class.
