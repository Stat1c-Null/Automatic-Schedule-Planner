Overall, she is the worst professor I have ever had. Good luck trying to get a straight answer from her; it will not happen. Her syllabus and instructions do not line up at all. I never write these and I have had some terrible professors in my days, but she is next to none.

On top of this, 3 discussion posts and 12 quizzes. Think that is all? The syllabus is outdated, and assignment instructions are unclear :-).

This program is very strict on deadlines, which I understand in a graduate-level course, however, she failed to simply put our grades into the registrar by the deadline. For this reason, she was unable to post our grades, and were told we would have to wait until May to receive our final grades.

Assigned 4 papers, 5-10 pages each, single-spaced, for a 7-week class. There's also a midterm and final, a bunch of discussions, 2 shorter papers, and 12 lockdown quizzes, all of which seem to be written to make you fail, even if you've done the reading and watched the videos.
