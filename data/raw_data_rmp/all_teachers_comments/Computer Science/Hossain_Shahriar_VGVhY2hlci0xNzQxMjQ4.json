He will help you with anything and it helps if you take it in class because there are just a limited number of questions that can be asked from email rather than in class.

He always respond to emails. 2. All his tests and assignments are from lectures or references provided by him. (Some tests and assignments were tricky, but its a very good learning.

He gladly accomodated some of assignments and quizzes that I missed. His reminder emails and announcements in GAView are helpful to catch up any missing hw, quiz, and exam.

The text book is used to do practices, but he does not follow it even a little. If you read the book, you will literally have to do a chapter per week to keep up, and half of the stuff you read you will never do in class. Not to bad of a teacher, but his lesson plan needs to be revamped.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODA4MTE1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
