He was very, very confusing throughout the course and often, it seemed like he didn't know how to explain things and couldn't offer any examples. He made up for all of this by making the midterm and final half take-home. So, if he messes up, he'll make up for it all later.

You can tell that he was scrambling to put together lectures at the last minute. Was not very good at first, but was open to criticism and improved based on it. Not a very clear grading criteria.
