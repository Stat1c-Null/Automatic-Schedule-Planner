There was a semester-long group project where you created documentation and software as a group, so the difficulty of the class comes down to how good your group is. Weekly Discussions, 3 lockdown tests, and the semester project. Sometimes took days to respond to emails. If you don't know how to code well, don't take this class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjIzNTI5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
