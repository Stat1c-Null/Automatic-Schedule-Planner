Regarding grading, he's relaxed. He mainly grades labs & tests. Labs themselves are due the next class period and others due the day of the lab. Tests are usually multiple choice,/TF and a couple short answer. Not that hard at all. With minimal studying, I've gotten A's on all the tests. Take him!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDk5NDI0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
