He provides plenty of lecture videos that correlate with the exercises and homework he gives out. If you are willing to spend time watching lectures, then this is the guy. Grading is straightforward.

For Org&amp;Arch, the department writes the tests since it's a weedout class so has no power over your tests.

Easy to understand, professional, and covers the material needed. The study guides can be a little bit tricky, but if you study the tests are pretty simple. The final was easy and it replaced one of your test grades, so if you actually try in school and not expect to get spoon-fed, you will get an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjU4MzY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Hilarious--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4720","date_posted":"2018-05-08 19:34:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took him for Internet Programming. Lectures were dull but the material is easy to learn since he provides helpful links to tutorials and documentation. 2 midterm tests and a final project. 6 assignments. He replaces ur lowest midterm grade with the final project.

He knows his stuff. Very helpful and understanding. His English isn't the best but still understandable. Labs are very important. Gives extra credit. Tests were pretty difficult but does curve.
