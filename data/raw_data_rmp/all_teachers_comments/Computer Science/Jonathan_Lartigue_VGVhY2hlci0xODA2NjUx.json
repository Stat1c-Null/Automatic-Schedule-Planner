Lartigue is by far one of the best professors I've taken.  He's strict and expects a lot out of his students, much more than what normal teachers expect.  But its because he pushes his students so hard that his classes are so helpful.  If you take Lartigue you'll definitely learn.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDMzMTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE3313","date_posted":"2016-12-07 18:57:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. He is completely draconian about attendance, classwork and project work, his workload is completely overkill by any standard, he can have a very bad temper over very minor things, and even his big group project is outside of the scope of the class BY HIS OWN UNWITTING ADMISSION.

His lectures are not structured and lack content. Tries to make up for it by making students study for an unreasonable amount of time on homework and projects. Unclear on expectations for those.
