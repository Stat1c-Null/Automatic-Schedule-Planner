He teaches out of his own textbook, which is full of grammatical errors and typos. His attitude is defensive and patronizing. Tests focus on factoids and minutiae instead of important concepts. Assignments are not difficult but time consuming.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjQ3Mzkw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3224","date_posted":"2013-04-24 23:41:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tough class, though I don;t feel that it had to be. if he didn't count homework and quiz's as much as he did, I probably would have dropped. Quiz's online, with unlimited times you can take, so take until you make 100. tests are unpredictable. he is very hard to understand and pay attention too. Bad news is that he is the only one that teaches this","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjAwNTQ2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSC1337","date_posted":"2011-11-18 02:44:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Too hard to read this guy. He's nice enough, funny, but seems to have little to no connection with the students. Labs are an absolute nightmare as far as prior information goes. It's kind of like learning but not really. Also a ton of stuff in lectures never showed up on tests, yet stuff that was not covered did. No idea. He's not terrible.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjcyOTgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE3224","date_posted":"2011-10-25 13:49:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very confusing.  Gives quizzes online & marks correct answers wrong, goes over material for labs after you've completed the lab.  Late posting labs and powerpoints and powerpoints have errors on them.

He will tell you what to study for the test, and then the stuff on the test is not what you studied. He loves trick questions on his tests.
