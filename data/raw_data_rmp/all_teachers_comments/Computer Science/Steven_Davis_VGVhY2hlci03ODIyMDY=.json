[{"class":"MATH1112","date_posted":"2011-05-07 15:54:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Goods: Clear, and no mandatory attendance or homework. Bads: fast, tends to teach as if you already know it, gives pretty hard tests (although his tests usually have as much if not more extra credit than the test is actually worth), and is NEVER available for outside help. Bottom line: take him if youre good at trig, avoid him at all costs if not.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTQ5MjE2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2011-04-26 14:12:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"very inconsiderate. cant teach. rude. sweats a lot. makes everything harder than it should be. i retook this class with a different teacher and made an A with no struggle. he does not allow retakes and is very willing to give Fs. he should not be aloud to hold a students future in his hands... an F can really mess up your future.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDY5OTIw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2011-04-08 23:52:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"awful teacher. needs to be fired. i have not heard of a single person that did not struggle. on grades come from tests. final is 50%","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzgwOTky","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2011-04-03 20:57:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Terrible teacher. I love math, but this man made it so unenjoyable. Not only are his lectures terribly boring, he cannot teach.  He reviews the material like you are supposed to already know it.  Your only grades come from tests and the final is 50%.  4 kids passed in my class out of the 8 who actually took the final. We started with 34 people.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzUwNDI1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1113","date_posted":"2011-01-01 15:55:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class will be very challenging if you're not a strong math person!

He expects you to understand as soon as it comes out of his mouth. Doesn't take attendance, but has a quiz in the first five minutes of almost each class, so don't be late. Not very helpful.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2ODM5NTI3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3260","date_posted":"2010-01-09 18:04:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is NOT the kind of teacher you want to take. His in-class teaching is weak at best, and there is a mandatory quiz at the beginning of every class. If you are even 2 minutes late, you lose final grade points. If you are late or absent 3 times, you lose 1 letter grade. Awful teacher","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzAxNjAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1112","date_posted":"2009-12-11 21:06:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Attendance is mandatory because you have a quiz every day, and each quiz counts toward your final grade. The homework was torture. He would assign every single problem in the book for that section (100+ problems), and his only advice for studying was to do the assignment twice. His lectures weren't helpful. VERY HARD CLASS.

Going to this class was so pointless, except for the fact he gives random quizzes that count toward your final grade. There is no online information, so if you miss class you will have no idea what you missed or what exams are... and he sweats like no one i've seen.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDg0MjYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS2302","date_posted":"2005-12-15 23:57:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Davis has a tremendous knowledge of Computer Science and programming.  However, his teaching methods left a little to be desired.  He would hand write code on the board for examples of concepts he was teaching.  In this class, though, that's not the best way to teach as we could not see how the code compiled and ran in the IDE we used.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExMTc4ODI3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
