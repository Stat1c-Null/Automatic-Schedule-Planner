She did not over work us and she did not grade the labs harshly. Just make sure you participate in the occasional discussion posts.

She would explain the required labs with good examples. I reached out to her for understanding concepts and she sets up teams call for it always during my availability.She explains concepts very well. However tends to completely not spoon feed the question asked in lab. Very caring towards students.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Nzg5ODAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1321L","date_posted":"2023-12-13 23:40:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a GTA, if you're new to coding, I recommend taking someone else. It felt like she really didn't care about the students, also a little hard to communicate with. During lecture she would usually explain the lab (does not go over assignments) for 10-30 mins on MS Word and then spends the next hour and a half taking questions in breakout rooms.
