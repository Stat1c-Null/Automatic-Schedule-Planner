There was not a lot of coding involved except for one assignment which he ended up waiving due to technical issues. The class is really just a lot of theory.

Said he didn't expect students to be able to complete the work he gave. Brags of &quot;open notes&quot; but expected detailed answers when the powerpoints are vague.

The tests are all open note and come straight from the PowerPoints, which you are allowed to quote on the tests. Open ended tests, no tricks. I think I have a 99.8% in the class and I have barely spent any time on this class.
