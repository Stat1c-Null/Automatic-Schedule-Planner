The material is difficult. There are a few assignments and quizzes and 3 exams, including the final. The professor knows his stuff and willing to explain further if needed. I like him.

It is a large classroom and he speaks softly with an accent. He also writes small on the board with a transparent marker. He is an easy grader for the most part.

He's got accent and might be difficult to understand. He is very nice. He will take your assignment if you didn't show up to the class during submission. Attendance is not mandatory.
