We had around 4 test/ quizzes and 1 project. Study guides are essentially identical to the test. Project could be substituted for a paper. Fair grader. He is an understanding professor and wants to create meaningful work.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzg4MzA2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS6045","date_posted":"2018-06-04 18:19:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Summer 2018 online class, dropped the class before drop/add deadline. Why you might ask? Summer semester is an 8-week session. This guy posted nothing the first week aka 1/8 of the class. No material. No communication. I've seen this before - this guy is another Ermias Mamo. Doesn't teach unless you complain to the dept.

He is a lousy lecturer and grades very lightly on easy assignments and test.  He is a nice guy though so that's something.  Take for free grade not to learn.  As a grad student, I'm there to learn.  This is why I am giving him a failing grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjQzNTk4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":19,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He cares about his students and he wants you to come out with an A. He will literally never give anything below a 60, which is a C in his class.

He was rough at the beginning, but he does really care.  Class feedback does wonders with him.  He didn't know how to communicate what he expected at first, but he figured it out.  While I don't know I'd take him again due to the short turn-in time for labs, he was good.  Tests aren't too bad.  He has an accent.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjY2MDA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS1302","date_posted":"2016-11-07 12:57:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's honestly one of the best teacher at KSU. He cares for his students, is flexible if need him. His sample exams are just like the test, his lab aren't too bad, and his grading is straight forward, no bs basically.

He is very humble and tries his best to teach his students. The test are similar to his study guides. He is fair with grading as well which a B for him is from 89 to 70.

Class is mostly him talking and then letting students try to solve a problem. Class grades are 2 test, 1 final, HW, attendance/quizzes. Algorithms covers things taught in DS at first so it's pretty easy.  He gives study guides for his tests which are similar to the actual test. Not exactly but it helps you understand concepts.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDg5Mjkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
