We had a project (can be done in groups) and discussions. He makes you work for it and he doesnt grade easy especially on the project. Keep track of due dates because this semester alot of people did their discussions late and stated he wouldnt grade them.

He is a wonderful professor who really cares about his students. If you need more time on an assignment, he usually won't hesitate to help you out. You are graded on very few things, but he's a pretty easy grader.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTQwNTE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":7,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDD4003","date_posted":"2018-01-27 19:38:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Fowler (or Allan as he prefers us to use) is the best games prof at KSU. He know's his stuff. He cares about helping us learn. He uses real world experience and knowledge to help explain stuff that is difficult to understand. He sometimes is a bit late at grading assignments, but I am sure he tries his best.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NTEwMTAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":10,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Skip class?

Seriously, take his class if you get the chance. He doesn't just gives away grades and you will have to work for a grade but that should be the case in any major level course. He's funny, helpful and an all around great guy.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTMzNDM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":17,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDD4003","date_posted":"2016-11-02 11:35:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy was a brilliant professor. He was professional, incredibly helpful, and hilarious pretty much every day. He made class exciting and we learned a lot. We only had one project the entire semester, but we used everything we learned into it.

His lectures are great and he is hilarious. Is clear about the assignments he gives you and always provides good feedback in D2L. No textbook required for this class, and he made us buy some games on steam to play and review them! Definitely a solid professor and would take again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzY1NTQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":22,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDD4803","date_posted":"2015-12-21 10:05:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fowler was a great teacher. We only had him for the latter half of the semester, but it was a great experience. He really knows what he's talking about, unlike a lot of other game design teachers here. He did often forget to give feedback on our projects but he was always more than happy to talk about them if we asked.
