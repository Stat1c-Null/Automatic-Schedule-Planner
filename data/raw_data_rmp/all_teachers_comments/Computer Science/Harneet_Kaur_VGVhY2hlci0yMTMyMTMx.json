HW won't be graded each week unless each lab for the week is complete. HW makes  up a majority of the grade and will help boost you up. She is willing to provide extra credit for tests especially if she knows the students are struggling. Not a bad professor at all.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODg0NjI4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"CARES ABOUT STUDENTS--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS3304","date_posted":"2016-07-19 14:15:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"As long as you know the basics about C++ you would be fine.
