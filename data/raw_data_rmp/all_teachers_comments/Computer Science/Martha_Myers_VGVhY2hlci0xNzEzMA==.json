I know that we are supposed to learn the basics, but don't be condescending. Just because you have a PhD. we do know more than you. She sure can beat a dead horse and is very talkative about nothing that has to do with nothing. Don't try to tell her something else..","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzODU4MzI3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS2100","date_posted":"2007-03-16 14:57:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was nice about halfway throughout the semester then she turned completely mean...she gave out plagiarism slips to almost half of the class for not citing something correctly on an assignment that she originally said did not need to be cited.

She has the knowledge to explain something more than one way, which is helpful if one method is confusing and ambiguous. Her office door and is always open if your question(s) are too specific and require more time to explain.

I would take her for every class I can, in fact I have. I recommend her highly! She really teaches the content before testing. She does like to challenge students just enough, but nothing that you haven't learned from her during class. She is also very interesting!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTU4OTY=","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS","date_posted":"2002-04-22 20:33:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"never took her, but she is so helpful and the nicest ever","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjA4MQ==","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS4830","date_posted":"2002-04-22 20:23:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"the best teacher I have ever had","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjA2Mw==","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
