Ok his english isn't very good, but he will do his best to help you under better. This is a mandatory class for ISA and CSIS, so I seriously recommend taking him. The 1st exam is average, 2nd was murder, and 3rd was easy. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzOTMxNzU4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS2520","date_posted":"2007-03-14 17:30:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gives pop quizs, but quizes do not reflect test. He has hard time speaking English, and goes slow. Everyone pretty much fails his tests, he will curve if average is 69 or below. He makes alot of mistakes when he is teaching, which causes me to get confused. Easy hw, hard test, and quizes. He is smart at what he knows, but is not a teacher.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyOTIxOTA5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS2520","date_posted":"2007-03-13 11:20:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very hard to understand with his accent. Extremely boring and slow which caused me to fall asleep numerous times. I  resorted to the book more than anything just because he makes the material way more confusing then it really is. Some pop quizzes too and the hw was quite easy. The test are semi hard but he will curve if enough people fail.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyOTE4NDgy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS2520","date_posted":"2007-02-01 15:03:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Has difficulties with English.
