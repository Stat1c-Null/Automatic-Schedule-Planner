We only had class once every two weeks, and class time was spent presenting the group projects we were working on. She doesn't teach anything useful about game design or development... in fact, she didn't teach anything. She was just there to grade our assignments. I learned nothing.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjkwMTM0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDD4303","date_posted":"2023-12-15 15:05:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"A majority of your time will be spent on a complicated group project for a client, and Li gives zero guidance about how to work with your clients or develop this project. What she does do is read PowerPoints filled with unhelpful info, verbatim. The already difficult class was made worse by the random papers we had to write. Ruined my semester.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjkwMDI2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDD4303","date_posted":"2023-11-29 16:37:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is an unstated \"Undergraduate Research\" course, and the professor uses this as a chance to offload other department's wishlist onto students.

Multiple discussions are due weekly including multiple responses. Random additional assignments that just seem more like busy work than anything to help us better our knowledge in the subject.

The workload might be heavy but you are allowed to team up with 2 other people to do the group projects for this class but she expects quality work if you're in a team rather than soloing it out by yourself.

The group projects were awful because the rubrics were confusing. She answers emails super fast though and you have several assignments to help boost your grade.
