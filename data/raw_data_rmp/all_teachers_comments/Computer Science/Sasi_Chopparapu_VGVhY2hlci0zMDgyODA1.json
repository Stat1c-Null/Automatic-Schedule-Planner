Sits in breakout rooms alone, doing nothing. Refuses to assist when there's an issue in grading. He will not speak in Zoom classes unless someone speaks up. Even then, he is not very helpful. Gives unclear and contradictory answers when asked questions.\n","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODM1NDU1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1321L","date_posted":"2025-03-25 16:15:07 +0000 UTC","comment":" He marks off points on assignments for no reason and gives excuses as to why they were taken off. He told me a -20 points was a rubric error and then submitted my 80 to the gradebook instead of a 100 for the \"error.\" Does not answer questions and acts like he doesn't know what were talking about. We sit in online zoom classes doing NOTHING.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODE0NDk4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
