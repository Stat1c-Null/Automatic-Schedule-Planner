Attendance isn't mandatory but you won't pass if you don't show up to his class because everything he explains helps us on the tests. His tests aren't hard at all so it's not difficult to do good in his class as long as ue do the hw & be there","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDU5NTcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

Answers questions in class and is very helpful in class during lab time and during lecture. He is a tad boring to listen. Puts all of his notes and recorded lectures online. Sometimes the labs are difficult. Overall, a very good, genuine professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTgzNDQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
