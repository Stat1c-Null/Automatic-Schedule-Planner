I found the class easy overall, but I did take AP Comp Sci in high school. I know a few people who were struggling because of his teaching method. He doesn't upload grades from what I can tell. He is an alright choice, just be ready to work.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODIxNTM5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS1301","date_posted":"2017-08-09 15:07:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took this course just for interest in Java, having with an undergraduate in Criminal Psychology already.  He has no patience whatsoever, and acts like he is so inconvenienced if you need additional help. He relies on his TAs to give the one on one help while he watches gaming Youtube videos. Horrible communicator, very immature, Avoid at all costs!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTk4OTc0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS1301","date_posted":"2017-05-09 15:23:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class doesn't do any justice, Self taught (FACT), material given is not sufficient enough for the work load, and that goes for test as well. There are NO Study Guides unless you pry it from him literally for the test. The Final is NOT given by him, the overall grade or where you stand in the class you wont know till the very end of term (FACT).","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjYxMjQy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

Lectures are pretty lengthy, but he breezes through them. The book is used for all the assignments. He doesn't baby you,  but is always willing to help. Tests are mediocre if you pay attention to lectures/PowerPoints. The class is overall a great experience if you are passionate & willing to challenge  yourself.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTA0NzA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS1301","date_posted":"2016-12-07 10:44:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's an okay professor. Nailes the concepts really well. His tests are crazy hard and you will never be prepared for them. If you take him prepared to spend a lot of time teaching yourself outside of the class.
