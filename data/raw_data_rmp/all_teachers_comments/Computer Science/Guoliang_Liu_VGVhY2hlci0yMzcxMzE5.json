His tests are some of the most difficult I have taken in college, but there's only 2 - midterm and final, and he gives a study guide that is very similar to the final. He's very helpful and responsive with any questions you might have. Overall, DEFINITELY RECOMMEND HIM!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTg4MDkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
