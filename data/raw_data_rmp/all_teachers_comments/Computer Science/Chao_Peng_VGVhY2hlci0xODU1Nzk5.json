His accent takes some time to get used to. The course material itself is quite easy - but expect to be doing most of the learning yourself through the textbook. Thankfully the textbook is very clear. He doesn't know how to teach.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzc5ODYz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
