Extremely lazy, does not respond to any communication attempts unless you involve her superior, and took an ENTIRE MONTH to grade a 3-QUESTION midterm. I'm not even sure if she actually knows how to code because there are so many errors on the assignments she makes it's crazy that she's actually teaching at a Uni.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTk2MDUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1321L","date_posted":"2022-03-27 21:04:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"You honestly don't even need her.  The work is all online and she's just there, almost like a parent supervisor during a field trip. She doesn't teach anything, the SI does most of the work. The manual grading is terrible compared to the autograder used on gradescope. Also, they aren't really concise with the directions for codes so look elsewhere.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTgxNTMw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1321L","date_posted":"2022-02-03 19:02:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"The course work is easy.
