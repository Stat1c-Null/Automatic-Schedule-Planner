He is not thorough at all when he grades, which frequently led to people emailing him photo evidence of things he marked off on to get credit for things they did. The projects don't entirely reflect everything in the class, and he does not produce the material provided, so he doesn't know anything about it.

Class is well organized and it is easy to keep up with the materials. I wouldn't say easy grader, but pretty fair. He makes sure not to be harsh for no reason, meaning if you follow the requirements, it's easy to keep an A. He's the best lab instructor I've had so far.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzU4NDg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
