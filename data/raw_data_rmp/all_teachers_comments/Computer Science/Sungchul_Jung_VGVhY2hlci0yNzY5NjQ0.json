You work in groups of up to 4 and create both a mobile game and an AR game. Several opportunities for extra credit, the projects are pretty easy, just make the game and do recorded presentations but the assignments can be a little annoying, especially the written ones (2) in how they're graded.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTk0NDA0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE3643","date_posted":"2022-05-06 20:03:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"He doesn't have a good enough rating on here, because I had an awesome experience with him this semester. Assignments are clear and he's very lenient with late work, gives great feedback, will respond to your emails quickly. You can see from just his syllabus that he cares a lot about helping and respecting his students.
