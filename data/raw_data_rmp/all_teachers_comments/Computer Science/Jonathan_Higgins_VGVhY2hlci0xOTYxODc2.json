It is a great introduction to the subject and I highly recommend this professor. The grading criteria is very straight forward: Does your program run like it is supposed to.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTQ0MDk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS1301","date_posted":"2016-08-03 02:49:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took him for Programming Principles 1 as a hybrid course. There is a lot of homework but if you do it you will pretty much learn how to code, if you don't do it you won't pass.

Not an easy class if u r not familiar with C or UNIX, but that's because of the material, not the instructor.  It is a manageable class if u doing the work.  While class is not mandatory, you do not attend at your own risk.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MTE2NDA3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
