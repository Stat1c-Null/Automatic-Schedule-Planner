Does not respond to emails, and didn't grade any of our assignments until the last couple weeks, when he decided to just give out 100s with no feedback. Course content is old and from another professor. I still learned, but I have no idea what I'm doing right or wrong.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTkyMDU1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS7267","date_posted":"2018-12-11 19:07:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Machine Learning isn't an easy subject but Dr. Kang does a fairly good job breaking it down. On tests, a conceptual understanding is fine. So it's ok if you don't perfectly understand the complex math. Generous grader. Partial credit and extra credit. Not absolutely perfect English but his accent is ok. One of the better CS professors at KSU.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTcyMzQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS7455","date_posted":"2017-05-08 07:42:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tough Teacher! I really like Dr. Kang and have always graded him highly.  He is very hard but you learn loads.  My only reason for a less than stellar grade this semester is that I took Mobile app Development to learn mobile app development.  Instead we learned OpenCV, a worthwhile skill but not app development.  Normally a 5/5 but missed the mark.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjQzNjAy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS1302","date_posted":"2016-12-11 13:12:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's willing to spend as much time as necessary answering students' questions in class.

He is a great guy and if you go to him for help he will give you any amount of help you need.  That said his lectures can be a little disorganized and hard to follow.  You will have to learn some on your own.  Good teacher, but poor lecturer.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTc1NDA0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS1301","date_posted":"2016-11-01 22:50:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"CS, by it's very nature, requires a good deal of practice, so your grade will be mainly influenced by the amount of time you spend coding. That being said,  Professor Kang is awesome! He's willing look at your code with you and show you specific places that you could improve.
