Every week you have a 10ish question quiz, with a midterm and final, all not-lockdown. Towards the middle and end you start having a lot of projects that can take hours to do, with instructions not clearly given. She is a very gentle grader though, so if you try its an easy A","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDc0MDM2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2022-11-06 21:55:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"You'll spend hours on assignments that the syllabus clearly stated had due dates/were graded then after the deadline for them she'll email saying it was optional or extra credit.

Every module has a due date that is different from what is stated. Lessons are jumbled. Currently three months into class and do not have a single grade in the grade book besides what McGraw-Hill automatically grades.
