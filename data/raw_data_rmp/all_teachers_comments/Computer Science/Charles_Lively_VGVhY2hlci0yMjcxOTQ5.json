Class was canceled left and right, basically moved from in person to online.  Incredibly dry when lecturing, just repeats from the slides.  Unreliable in releasing assignments, announces they will be released one day but they won't show up for a week.  Doesn't respond to student emails either.  10/10 don't recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDQ5MDkx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3112","date_posted":"2021-09-07 21:41:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"This course was taken for Junior Design.

Lectures uploaded randomly and rarely on time. Lectures themselves were usually the professor reading off of slides, and seemed very disinterested. Grading was confusing and often contradictory.
