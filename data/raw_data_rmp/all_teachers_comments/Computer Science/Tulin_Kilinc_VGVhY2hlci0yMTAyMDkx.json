Had her for internet programming. We learned JavaScript,Python, Php, HTML, CSS, ... and she was no help. She said she likes back end and hates front end but has to do it.

Lecture is very unclear due to her accent. She assigns quizzes that are sometimes easy and sometimes hard, mostly hard. Beware of the pop quizzes and if she messes up, it will take time from your TEST DAY. Yea, limited amount of time to finish.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjY3NzI5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

She seems strict and like a tough grader in the beginning but as the semester goes on, things get easier.

It was doable but you had to plan wisely to get it all done on time. It was 2 projects, about 3 assignments and 2 labs within the span of a month.

She just read the ppt and never write things  to make students understand. She never showed example codes(the code made by her not in the provided ppt).
