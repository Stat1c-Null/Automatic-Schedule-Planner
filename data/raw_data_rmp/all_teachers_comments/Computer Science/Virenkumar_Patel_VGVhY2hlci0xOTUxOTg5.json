He taught the theory behind the information and tested on things that you had never seen. Changed my final project - told me it was good (messed it up program) - said it was good - I submitted (my fault - trusting). He should take a teaching class!!  The labs take home - due to his length.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDY5ODE4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1301","date_posted":"2014-12-08 13:05:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hands down worst teacher I've ever had. Terrible at explaining subject material and  assignment directions. Tests questions are lengthy and confusing. End of the semester project was the hardest project I've ever had to do.

Not because the subject was terribly difficult but explanations are vague, lectures are miserably boring, grades strictly on labs, and expects more on the tests than what was taught in class.
