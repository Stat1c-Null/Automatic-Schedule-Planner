She expects you to understand it like she does. She doesn't listen and when you ask her questions she becomes defensive and mean. Grades harshly and could care less if students understand or not.

She is neither helpful nor capable in teaching the course. She doesn't listen to begin with. PLEASE never take a course with her!

She is the worst professor I've had as far as grading assignments goes. She will literally find something, ANYTHING to take points away from you. And she just picks a random, arbitrary number to deduct from your assignment. Usually, the points are deducted simply because she is confused or doesn't understand what you're saying.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODU0OTA5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--SO MANY PAPERS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS5040","date_posted":"2016-12-08 13:05:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor I have ever encountered throughout all of my years of education. She refuses to answer any questions (regardless of how small) and tells you to figure them out by yourself.

Her accent  sometimes creates a difficulty to follow her. She doesn't like to be asked a question.
