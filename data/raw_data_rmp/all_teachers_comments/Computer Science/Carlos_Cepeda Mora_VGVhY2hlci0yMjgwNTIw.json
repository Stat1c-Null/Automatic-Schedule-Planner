He cares about students and wants them to do well in the course, and in our class attendance was extra credit so be sure to attend every class. I have learned a great deal about Java and programming with Java.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjMyODA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

The code he distributes for assignments is messy and old. His instructions are very vague and unclear. During lectures, he talks slightly above a whisper and doesn't seem to grasp the concepts he is teaching enough to explain them adequately, leaving his students frustrated and confused.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NjgwNDI1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
