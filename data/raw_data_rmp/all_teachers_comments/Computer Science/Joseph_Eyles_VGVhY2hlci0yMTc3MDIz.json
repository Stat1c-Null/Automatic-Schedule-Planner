There was a cheating incident during the class so the the final test was rewritten. Unfortunately, the lectures were not adapted so there was no link to the material tested. Very poor class.

Gives quite a bit of extra credit points and drops one grade. There is a research paper and presentation which are on a topic of your choice which doesn't make it too bad.

He seems reserved at first but is pretty loose and humorous. He requires class participation by calling you out and asking for your opinion (you end up learning a lot more). The homework isn't terrible, and the tests are easy for the course. There is a big research project, though, which is odd for a coding class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODUzNjE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3304","date_posted":"2017-02-04 13:03:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lenient with grading, at least from what I heard. But assigns too much REPETITIVE work for absolutely irrelevant stuff. An example is hand-sketching about 70 linear graphs because he thinks it is beneficial. For a data structures class...
