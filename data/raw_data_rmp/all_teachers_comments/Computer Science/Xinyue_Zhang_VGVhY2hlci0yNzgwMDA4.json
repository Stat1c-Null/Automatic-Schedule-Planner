Class is helpful in understanding the material and example problems of the cryptographic algorithms, which match the test. 1st test allowed a whole page of notes, 2nd/3rd were open book. She was very helpful when I had something come up. Dr. Zhang is a good professor, I recommend taking her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTI1MTI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS7375","date_posted":"2022-05-10 13:37:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very good professor, really wants you to understand the content. Not a tough grader. It got a little overwhelming at the end of the semester, but otherwise not bad on workload. 3 Assignments, 2 tests, and a semester-long project that you can do alone or in a group. Very responsive to emails. Would love to have her class again in the future.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mjk2MzE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
