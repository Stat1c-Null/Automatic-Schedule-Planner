When u ask questions she puts in lot of effort to answer your questions and helps you more and above than you expected. Her resources are amazing, which i believe she made it herself so very inspirational. People who gave 1stars are just people who were super lazy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NDcxNTM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4803","date_posted":"2021-03-28 03:05:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very bad teacher. I took her online asynchronous and her lectures were uploaded to youtube and were unbearable to watch. She gave 3 or 4 homeworks which weren't too bad, but her tests were pretty hard. The questions required lots of memorization of pseudocode. She also assigns a 15 page project writeup. I would steer clear if possible.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDgxMDc4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS3305","date_posted":"2020-12-06 21:33:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely terrible, doesnt provide feedback on assignments and practically wasnt even doing anything for the course. Left in the latter half of the semester with best instructions left to the professor that picked up her class who gave instruction haphazardly.

Makes assignments out of the textbook and gives vague direction paired with awful grammar (hasn't picked up on english fully) which translates awfully for an online class.

Concepts covered in class rarely appeared on tests. Few grades mean that mistakes are hard to recover from. Tests were incredibly long to the point of 3 finishing out of a class of 50-60 in the allotted time. Questions are rarely answered, and assignments might as well be written in Hieroglyphics.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTE3MzM1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS3305","date_posted":"2020-02-13 18:22:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Stay away, she is awful at teaching.
