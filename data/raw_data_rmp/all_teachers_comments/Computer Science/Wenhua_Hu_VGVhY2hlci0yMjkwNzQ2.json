She barely knows the English language and has never worked in the field she is teaching. As such there is often a miscommunication when any student asks for clarification. The class has two tests and a group project. Don't take if you don't want to spend twice as much time on this class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NTg2ODIw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SWE3643","date_posted":"2018-01-12 13:53:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Impossible to understand.
