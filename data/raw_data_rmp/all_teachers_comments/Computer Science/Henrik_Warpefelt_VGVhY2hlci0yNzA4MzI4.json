He does not do a good job describing the instructions and grading criteria for assignments or giving feedback. What little instructions he does give reads in a very condescending tone. I implore you to take this class in person to enjoy it more.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NzcyMzQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDD-4003","date_posted":"2023-12-14 14:07:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"My biggest complaint about Prof. Warpefelt is that his grading criteria for the Notebook submissions was extremely unclear, and it took most of the semester to figure out what he was wanting. He's a tough grader with the semester long group project, with very quick submission times - Assigned Monday, due Thursday.

One group project from the beginning of the semester, 3 notebooks to turn in, and weekly discussions. He posts his lectures online and invites his online students to join the meeting in teams so you don't miss out.
