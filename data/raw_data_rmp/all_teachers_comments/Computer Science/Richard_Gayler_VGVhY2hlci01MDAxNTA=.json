He tried to pack 16 weeks into 8 and was not willing to let anything go. 3 exams PLUS a comprehensive final AND a group project on top of homework every week. He is unbending on grades. If you have an 89.9, you just got yourself a B. No grading curve either. He does try to help those who ask- that's the only good thing I can say","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjI5NjIx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS2302","date_posted":"2010-08-11 12:25:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing teacher. The class was quite difficult and the labs/assignments were extremely time consuming. Dr. Gayler is an incredible teacher though and he even puts his class lectures online incase you cannot make it to class. I definately advise taking his class, but be prepared to work hard.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTAxMDcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3401","date_posted":"2010-08-09 13:39:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tough class... but Dr Gayler is a great teacher. He will explain it until you understand. He concentrates on theory..so if you have problems generating code then you MUST seek his help.

He is always willing to help you no matter what, and does so by barely giving you enough push to get the next step; therefore, he is a professor that helps by helping students figure it out on their own.

He will try to keep you interested and help you learn the concepts of programming but he solely relies on lectures which arent very effective.
