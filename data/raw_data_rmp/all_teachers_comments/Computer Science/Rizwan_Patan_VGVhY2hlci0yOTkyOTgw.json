He does FANTASTIC at email responses.\nNow other than that, he's horrible at teaching and giving instruction. His assignments make zero sense. Quizzes and tests ask random, unrelated questions and some answers may be wrong. Semester project is super unorganized. Take literally anyone else if you can.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjQ5MjAy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE3313","date_posted":"2024-05-07 22:31:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very unclear expectations and low communication skills. He has a thick Indian accent as well, which was hard to parse. He rarely emailed back, and when he did he often didn't reply with relevant info. I never knew what he wanted us to take from his lectures and they felt disconnected from his quizzes and exams. I suggest avoiding him at all costs.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mzk3NDMz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
