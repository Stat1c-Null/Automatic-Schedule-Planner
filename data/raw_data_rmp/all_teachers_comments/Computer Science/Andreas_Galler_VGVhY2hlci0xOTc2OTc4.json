Gives 2 bonus assignments at the end of the semester that replace two lowest homework grades. Tests quizzes are SUPER easy. Minimal studying necessary. Be in class and skim through the PowerPoint's and it's an easy A. Definitely would take him again!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NjUyODQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS2301","date_posted":"2015-03-16 00:32:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was funny and also helpful when needed. Great knowledge of the content. As long as you go to classes, do your work, and study for tests you should be fine. He grades a little harder, but he looks at your work which gives partial credit!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDY0MjQ5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS2301","date_posted":"2015-02-26 11:15:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"For someone who never encountered computer programming before, the subject itself was a challenge in the beginning. However I think Professor Galler prepared me very well throughout the semester. As long as you're in class, do assignment, lab, and study, quizzes and tests are very reasonable.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDE0ODY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
