But this professor made me write this because he's really that good! You will have to do alot of reading but it is very straight forward and there are no surprises when it comes to tests and assignments. As long as you do the reading it won't be a problem to get an A. Gives great feedback and really cares","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTI1MDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3223","date_posted":"2018-04-16 13:15:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very nice and involved for an online class. Easy to ask questions and assignments aren't to difficult. Grades are mostly HW, Group project and easy weekly discussions. He is not a harsh grader and wants you to do well.

The group project was VERY relevant to real world experience. Professor Hogarth is readily available to help students, and if you do the work and understand the concepts, you will pass the class with flying colors.

The homework is in the book but it does require you to think about the subject. This makes the class that much better and easier to understand.
