She is understanding and truly wants you to pass. If you go to her classes often, it gives you a higher chance for her to help you out when it comes to the end of the semester. She does make some mistakes, but at least she realizes them, fixes them and comes back to class to explain where she was wrong.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTI4Mzg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3305","date_posted":"2024-05-07 22:37:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Tasnim made passing CS3305 easier than I expected it to be.

Our schedule did not include due dates for any assignments/project. Gave unclear deadlines throughout the semester. Instructions for quizzes/assignments/project were also vague. Lectures weren't engaging. But gave makeup quizzes and bonuses. Just seemed I went through the course blind.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MTg1OTMz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3305","date_posted":"2024-01-25 19:45:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Professor Tasmin for Data Structures during her first semester of teaching.

She does try and give opportunities for extra credit and gives good study guides for the exams, which have not been that hard so far. However, Data Structures is a hard class for most, so I recommend taking someone else who can help you understand the material better. If you already know the material, she is a good choice.
