Overall, maybe not the best lecturer I've ever had, but he made sure to explain anything we had trouble understanding and used plenty of visual aids and actual code. Our TA's never showed up for our labs but he helped and checked us all off each time, often staying past class time. Was also lenient with deadlines.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjgyMTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
