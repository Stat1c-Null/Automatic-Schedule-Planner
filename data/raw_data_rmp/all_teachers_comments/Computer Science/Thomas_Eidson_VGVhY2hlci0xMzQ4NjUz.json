I can code fine but the amount of detail he wants is stupid. I pretty sure the best programmer in the world could fail this class only because he barely care about the code and ONLY the details.

Unless you already know programming, you're up a creek. He acts like he knows everything, but he doesn't know how to teach it to students. He also treats the 1301 class as an introduction to 1302.

Eidson may be tough but if you get through his class you will most definitely get a great education and come away a serious cut above other CS students.
