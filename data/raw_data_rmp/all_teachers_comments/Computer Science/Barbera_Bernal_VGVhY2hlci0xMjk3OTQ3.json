Group projects to complete in a week just aren't feasible online and yet every week, there's a new group project and you can't pick your members. Grades very infrequently and puts too much emphasis on discussion posts.

Nothing but busy work. Ms. Bernal seems nice in class, but in person is very quick to try and find things wrong, and is condescending and rude. You can take her for an easy A, but she has NO manners.

She does not really teach the class well enough to the point where you feel that you know it. Her tests are unclear with her questions because you will read it one way and get no points because of how you read it.

She is so disorganized that she fails to teach pertinent information. She \"left\" teaching for a semester and came back, but is no better than she was before. She is also absolutely NOT helpful.
