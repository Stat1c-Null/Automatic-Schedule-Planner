She doesn't actually teach, just reads off what the powerpoints say. Do not take this class if you actually want to learn Python from it. Instead I've had to resort to YouTube and classmates to learn. Really a waste of money on this class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjQ5Mzg2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1114","date_posted":"2024-12-13 02:06:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great home lab experience (1114L) and intuitive topics for discussion(1114), she was very helpful through it all.

Grade is made up of the 12 weekly labs. Enters grades in D2L quickly and responds to emails in a timely manner. Learned a lot about Python in the labs alone so I would definitely take her.
