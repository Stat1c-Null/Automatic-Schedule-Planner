Quizzes and tests have questions never seen before, and projects make no sense, but he will give you a good grade if you write 20 pages of non-sense. 2-3 lectures a week, but you can not understand what he is saying.

No way of knowing which ones he'll quiz/test you on, but half of the quiz/test questions are irrelevant to the slides anyway. Audio on lectures is just awful, and he teaches like he's bored of it.

Mostly he just plays videos or runs slides n reads them. Rubrics are told on last day before you get final grade.
