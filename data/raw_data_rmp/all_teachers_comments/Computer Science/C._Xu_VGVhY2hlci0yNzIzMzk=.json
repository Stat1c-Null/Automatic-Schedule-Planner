A little tough at first, but if you do what he tells you to do, he is easy. Hard to understand for lecture, very soft spoken. He curves the class grades. Pay attention to his lectures and memorize the code... do not expect tons of help from him... Final project was class graded they were harder on  each other than he was.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDkzNzc2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4491","date_posted":"2009-05-08 22:31:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Once told all of us that if we didn't finish an assignment within a certain number of days, we should kill ourselves. We believe he was joking, but the half-horrified chuckles around the classroom said it all.

Has unclear requirements and uses an unknown grading scale.  Posts reviews for test less than one day before.  Claims never received homework when sent, then refuses to show he didn't receive it.  Doesn't share code on topics and will not assist in code debugging.  Don't take this guy.

He gives a quiz every other day. The tests are hard but his grading makes it even harder. The material is somewhat interesting, but he presents boolean functions as the most important concept in the world when it clearly isn't. I would not recommend him for he is a terrible teacher.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MTA2OTQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS4520","date_posted":"2006-07-31 11:23:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good teacher, sometimes you can't tell when he's asking a question. Class was good, it should be taught in a computer lab (either that or you better have a good powerfull pc/laptop) because of the tool used (Java Studio Creator). Tests are OK, expect to write codes in the test even though you hardly do any coding with the tool.
