I think it's a cultural difference. He intends to be friendly but comes off rude sometimes. Tests were book tests that were a bit arbitrary and I don't feel I learned that much from his lectures or slides. He gives so many extra credit points though, so it's totally possible to get an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMjgzNjQy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":9,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS6027","date_posted":"2018-05-29 23:08:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take a class with this professor (especially networking)!. It is already a difficult subject which he made more difficult with his heavy accent, an insane project that even the tutoring lab was unable to help with, and closed notes/book tests that required in-class or Lockdown browser with webcam.

He gives practice problems, and the tests are basically taken directly from them.  Grades hard. Gives Full, Half, or No credit, but his criteria for Half credit seems overly specific.  Very thick accent.  Doesn't detract from his lectures, but if you have never dealt with a Korean accent before, be prepared .","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTU2NzMy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS3304","date_posted":"2017-01-10 10:41:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"As long as you do your work, you will get an A. 1) Do all your assignments, 2) Do all extra credit assignments, 3) Don't skip too often, 4) Just do Average on Exams.

He disrespected students from other sections in front of our class (why?).  The textbook we used had prebaked code to use for assignments which made everything really easy.

He is always available during his office hours and he offers 3 optional extra credit assignments, that can boost you up a whole letter grade if you can manage to complete all 3.
