Thankful he allowed notes for last test. Practical was stupid hard, no one got it right because he didn't tell us what to do or expect.

I hope to have him for future classes. He actually teaches and knows what he is saying unlike some other ISA/IS professors at KSU (A la Green). It is true that some of his sample code has typos but they are usually pretty easy to spot.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODc0ODQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISA3010","date_posted":"2009-05-13 16:24:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Richard Austin should not be associated with the sea of tech hacks that make up the faculty of the KSU CS/IS/ISA departments. He's actually got  experience! He's not a recent grad trying to pass off fake experience either. He is helpful to both geeks and business oriented students. Take a class with him just to realize what a hack isn't.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODI5OTM4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISA3010","date_posted":"2009-05-06 21:16:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor.

If he actually compiled the examples he wouldn't have syntax from 3 different languages mixed together. Seems to know a little about security, but I don't think he's got much real world experience. Id say his more of an IT guy, and they are a dime a dozen. He's still better than 90% of the rest.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Nzc3NTQx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISA3010","date_posted":"2009-04-08 11:48:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy is a great professor.
