Took him for SWTQA and he just used recycled slides from other professors and didn't even bother to remove their name. Was condescending when half the class tried to talk to him about issues we were having. He takes points off for ridiculous things and material covered in slides he reads from during lectures pretty much useless.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTMzMTgw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE3643","date_posted":"2023-05-08 05:56:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not clear with assignments!!!

He's a really nice guy as a person, however, his teaching ability is not the best as he strays away from the topic quite often and reads directly off the slides giving no additional information nor actually \"teaches\" the class. Quizzes have nothing to do with notes or class lectures, all online no webcam.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDE3NjM0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
