His lectures are thought provoking and are loaded with very useful real-world knowledge.  I took his Intro to SWE course, and, as he said, this course has much more breadth than depth. I felt the (2)  group projects markedly improved my skill and industry-readiness.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDI3MzUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE3313","date_posted":"2015-11-05 15:57:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tsui is a tough grader. There are only 4 grades in his Software engineering class, and the midterm and final were each worth a third of your grade. He also doesn't give a study guide, but you can pass if you pay attention and study the power points. His lectures are interesting, though, and he is really passionate about what he teaches.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzUyMTcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE3643","date_posted":"2012-05-03 01:47:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is the best professor for software engineering and maybe in the whole university. He is tough but you will learn a lot and you do not need the text book.

His midterm and final are worth about 75% of your grade. He grades based on your rank in the class. The top few get A's, the next group gets B's, most get C's, and others get D's and F's. So it is really unfair. My advice is to study his powerpoints to death and with that, you will be okay.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5ODYxMTA1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE6763","date_posted":"2011-06-10 15:23:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing professor overall.
