However, he did miss four weeks of school so we had to teach ourselves a good bit. This shouldn?t be a hard subject but Dr.Haddad made it hard buy not being there to help. I did not learn anything from him.

He is knowledgeable about Java in terms of what the class teaches. However, he seems to just be teaching classes, and doesn't seem interested in programming himself. This is a shame considering he's been in the game for a while.

The multiple choice is a little tricky. However, the final was  SOOOOOOOO much easier than his exams.

I found out that he gives the hardest tests of all of the professors. The final, which was the same for all CS 2301 students, was easier than all of his tests.
