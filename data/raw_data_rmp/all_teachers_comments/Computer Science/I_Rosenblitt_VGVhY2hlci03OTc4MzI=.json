Her lecture style involves reading the PowerPoints; I got along just fine in her class because I understood the math on my own, but if you're not able to do that, the class might be difficult. But, honestly, it's Math 1101. It's not that hard. If nothing else, take her for the cheat sheets.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MDgzNTgw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2008-11-07 10:12:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Rosenblitt is a very nice lady but her class was terrible. She tried hard to be helpful but it just ended up being more confusing. I never attended class and never did a homework assignment.

Let's you use cheat sheets on every test....even the final. Will explain anything you do not understand. Will help with problems on the test, during the test. Really nice lady. Do not have to go to class, just review days and you'll be fine. Does give a little extra credit, but helps a lot in the end!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NDI4NTky","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS2301","date_posted":"2008-03-28 00:49:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice lady, but not a very good professor.

Knows whats in the book, and tests on it. Does not know her way around Windows XP, which had me scratching my head. I've been in the field for over 20 years, and this class could have been much more informative and entertaining. Somewhat helpful, but seems a bit shy most of the time. Easy class if you study.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMjIzNDY3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1101","date_posted":"2007-01-08 17:02:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"i had her for math for some reason, and i liked it.  a lot of pepole didn't like it, but if you take high school algebra before, then this class is really easy.  just take notes and study and you'll be fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNzQyMTA3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS2301","date_posted":"2006-12-18 10:39:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had a little programming experience before taking this class and I found it very easy.
