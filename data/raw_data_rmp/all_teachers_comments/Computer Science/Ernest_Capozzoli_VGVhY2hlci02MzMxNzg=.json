It's very straight forward. Online quizes and problems out of the book due every week. Very easy. XBRL paper was time consuming, he grades hard on formating and siting. Follow his outlines. Rivet software download only lasts one month so make sure complete XBRL assignment within the window. Overall, easy B, medium A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTA3NjUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT8230","date_posted":"2009-05-08 18:55:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good guy to have a beer with, but he's a point nazi with a disturbing obsession with XBRL.  The content of the class comes secondary to the XBRL paper, even though technically there are more points from book assignments.  I ended up with an 89.8% overall in the class and he still gave me a B.  Not pleased in any way with that, but he's a nice guy.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Nzk3NjA1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT3300","date_posted":"2008-10-13 00:09:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took the class over the summer (4 week session). This first day of class he decided to put everything online which was WONDERFUL! So from that point on everything was there tests and quizzes all open notes. One long paper took him no longer than 15 minutes to grade. Now that I am in other classes I am finding that I didnt learn what I need to.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0ODY1MzIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ACCT615","date_posted":"2007-04-26 14:39:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy class.
