This is an open book/note class where your success comes mainly from using the book and powerpoint slides. Repeat: ALWAYS check the slides/book before searching for info online. All the work was straight forward and the class is an easy A if you use the right sources. I unfortunately did not learn that until midterms.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODEzMjk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE3801","date_posted":"2019-06-04 02:41:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Has the usual workload, but grades very easy. Originally had a group project that he removed. Ended up being graded by a few short papers (like 1-2 pages each), 2 quizzes, and 10 discussions. He also gave an extra credit quiz at the end of the semester. Nice teacher for pretty boring content.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTkxOTk1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
