If you want to learn and better your self than you will. Like she said, \"Life's not fair you have to fight to make a differance.\" She is by far the best professor I have ever had.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTQzMTQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1301","date_posted":"2014-03-12 08:48:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not helpful at all!

It can be challenging if u r new to Java. Make sure u at least make an attempt to do the work and submit. Also the book helps. She is rather slow when it comes to response time and grading. Also towards the end of the semester she gives extra credit work. I got an A+.

If you do the required work, show up for class, participate during class, etc. you'll likely end up with an A. It was her first time ever teaching, and she seemed to have a lot of potential as a professor. If I had to choose whether or not to recommend Sheri, I would recommend her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzg3MjE2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3243SEC001","date_posted":"2013-03-11 17:21:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Doesn't know what she's talking about half the time. Not helpful at all. Gives quizzes to \"help\" prepare for test, but the quizzes aren't helpful at all.
