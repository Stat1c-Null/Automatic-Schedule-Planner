He's pretty difficult to understand but you get used to the accent. He's funny and helpful sometimes, but you really have to back him into a corner to get the help. Attendance isn't necessary.

There was only one test (the final exam) and 3 assignments. Even though there isn't a lot of HW, this class sure does make you learn about databases.

All the material was not up-to-date. So you have to just figure it out all by yourself. Grades are always A if you submitted all your work ontime. Very considerable for the students, that he reserved the text book in the library for the students to borrow.

Sometimes he will misunderstand a student's question though. And yes, we only have 3 assignments and no comprehensive final, so the workload is low.

He knows his stuff but can't teach it to others. Often times would ask the class if we understood the ppts because he didn't. Doesn't really answer questions and his tests have nothing to do with the material he covers in class. He does make up for his lack of teaching ability by giving bonuses worth over 10% of final grade.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Nzg0OTk3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3153","date_posted":"2011-04-12 17:41:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher knows stuff, but he has hard time to make me us understand the course.
