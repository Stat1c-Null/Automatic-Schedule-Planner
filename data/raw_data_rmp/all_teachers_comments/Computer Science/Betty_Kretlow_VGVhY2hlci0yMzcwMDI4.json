She pretty much gives you everything you need to know either by lecture or resources, and if you need more time more than likely she will give it to you. She is very understanding of any circumstances and will listen to your request more often than not. Take her, but do study the mats.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzk5MzM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4306","date_posted":"2019-05-03 00:33:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Such a super sweet person. She loves chatting with her students. She has a good sense of when she thinks the class isn't understanding something and will explain it again. Algorithm Analysis in itself is kinda boring but she makes it interesting. Graded on Quizes(20%), HW(20%), and 2 exams(60%). If she sees you making real effort you will get an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzUzNzAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3305","date_posted":"2018-12-10 05:40:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"EASY-going and knowledgeable. I don't want to say the class is EASY(C++ is very frustrating to learn), but she makes studying for her tests EASY. No curve-ball trick questions. Attendance is basically mandatory and she'll call you out for missing classes. The class builds on itself so make sure you keep up with the curriculum and you'll do fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTQwMjQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4308","date_posted":"2018-05-04 19:20:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took her for Concepts of Programming Languages. The class was boring but she made it very simple and easy. Really flexible and understanding with assignments. Listens to students and has some interesting stories. You learn a lot. The only gripe I had was that the structure was weird since we ended up sharing d2l with another professor","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTkwNjAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":8,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
