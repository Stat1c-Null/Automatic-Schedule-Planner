He claims fairness means treating all students the same, ignoring individual situations. His teaching lacks originality and uses all materials from another professor. I regret investing my time and money in this course due to the poor experience.\n","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODMyMzk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS7050","date_posted":"2024-07-24 01:29:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had the pleasure of taking a data mining course with Professor Jacob, and it was an outstanding experience. His teaching style is simple and straight to the point, making complex concepts easy to understand.
