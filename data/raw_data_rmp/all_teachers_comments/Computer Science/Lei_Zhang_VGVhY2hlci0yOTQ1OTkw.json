He would call something a \"playtesting day\" and then make us do presentations instead of actual playtesting because he did not know what playtesting was. He's also an AI bro who wants everyone to use generative AI.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzQxOTMx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"swe3313","date_posted":"2024-08-12 19:43:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"I absolutely loved my summer semester online 3D Modeling and Animation course with this professor. In the feedback of our first modeling exercise I received a 20-minute personalized review of my assignment and challenge points I had noted down as part of the assignment. Also accommodated me working ahead by grading some parts of a project early.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Njc4MTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"swe3313","date_posted":"2024-05-09 20:24:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Insanely rough grader for no reason, we asked him for feedback on a project before we submitted it, applied all the feedback, and he still have us a 70 something.

The professor's lectures are very interesting, but personally I would go through the slides again on D2L to prepare for quizzes and tests.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDg3NzM4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDD2014","date_posted":"2023-12-17 17:28:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"His lectures are hard to follow and he has little control over his class.

His lectures are unorganized and difficult to follow, but the resources outside of the lecture (textbook, articles, and videos) are really good so it's easy to understand the material we need to study.
