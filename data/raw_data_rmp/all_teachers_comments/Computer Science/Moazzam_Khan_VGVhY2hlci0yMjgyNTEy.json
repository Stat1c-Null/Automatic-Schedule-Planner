I heard a lot of static about how he never replied back to students, but he always responded promptly when I emailed him. The test and quizzes were challenging and short timed but hey its an online class which is easy enough. The class was not hard. I got 100s on all the assignments.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDAwMTE3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Clear grading criteria--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1311","date_posted":"2018-04-18 11:26:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you're taking Intro to C++ with Professor Khan, get ready to teach yourself! Professor Khan didn't actually do a lick of teaching the entire semester, instead relying on another professor's very old videos. Also, he will literally take 2+ months to grade your assignments, leaving you with no idea if you're doing things right or not.

It will take a month to get a grade for a HW assnmnt. HW Labs arent too hard. Quizzes are difficult, you have very little time to read the question and select an answer. Do not expect to receive an Exam grade for about 2 months. Our class had to reach out to the department head for Exam 1 grades.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODEyMzk1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IT4490","date_posted":"2018-01-11 14:06:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"I keep forgetting my pillow to this class because of his mumbling during the lectures. He's a very knowledgeable guy but as a teacher, he is one of the worst. He teaches at his level of understanding so teaching yourself is the only way to learn.

Out of my whole college career in the IT Department, this is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. He will not grade anything until after the drop/add date. Will not elaborate any questions you ask.
