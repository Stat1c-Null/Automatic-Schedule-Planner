He is a less academic and more &quot;real world&quot; type of teacher.  If you want a structured, disiplined class, then he is not the professor for you.

Explains well, lectures are organized with slides on the web. Tells you exactly what to expect in tests. Very smart guy, easy-going and knows the stuff he's talking about.

Unfortunately, you will never be tested on any of those discussions.  All tests come from the book, from which he rarely lectures.

Then took this guy and almost failed his intro course.  I can not believe KSU is letting him teach.  His classes are pointless.  I went to every one and regret it.
