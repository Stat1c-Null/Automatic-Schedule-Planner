There is no lectures, since this is a hybrid class, and the only thing you'll probably be doing are the labs or procrastinating and doing other things.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NDQ5NTk0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS1302","date_posted":"2015-11-10 11:30:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is an incredibly difficult professor. He specializes his class so much, that if you come from a different professor you won't pass. He hates questions that are outside the class. Not sure how he still has his job. His \"10 years industry experience\" is a lie. This man clearly isn't professional and shows it in every lecture.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mzc5NzAw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":7,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS 1301","date_posted":"2015-10-23 20:12:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Jones is a great professor. He drops 8 grades... so you can fail 8 assignments (2 from each section i.e hw, lab and quizzes)& still get ATLEAST an A or B. I do research with him and attended a seminar he put together for students about maintaining their health. He really does care about his students.

He does not welcome anyone who cannot code the way he does; he is picky on the way you format your code. He gives 12 programs a week (he says its only six small programs but in each section its two). You get one week to do that and for some odd reason 2 for the homework.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MjA5NzMw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS2301","date_posted":"2015-04-29 12:57:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had a fledging interest in computer science. He stomped it out of me. Be prepared to work for at least a solid 2 hours every single day after class because the workload is relentless. And if you get just one thing wrong on the homework, you get a 0 for the assignment.

Finds a lot of things to take points for but  does not show the same effort to help students. Negligent to the degree it is insulting, barely grades any assignments and in weeks even months and if he does, never provides feedback.

My only complaint is we are still waiting on grades from our homework that was turned in near the beginning of the semester. Due to a hybrid class, he did not have full control over what was being taught, but he offered a lot of extra credit to help grades.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDI2OTI5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":9,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2301","date_posted":"2014-12-02 00:57:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"I'd give him 5's across the board if he was actually able to teach his own curriculum. His real world approach and insight (which you only get to see in snippets) is the most interesting part of the class. The rest of the class time is spent either being boggled by Hhaddads bizarre curriculum or watching the professor himself be boggled by it.

The class was a hybrid so there were no lectures, but Dr. Jones made the class a lot easier and java easier to learn. He was always attempting to reach out. It's programming so it is still going to be no easy A, but he dumbs everything down.
