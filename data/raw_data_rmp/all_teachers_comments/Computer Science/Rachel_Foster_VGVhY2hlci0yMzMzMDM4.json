She told us she was previously a software engineer so this is her retirement job and it shows. Since this is an ethics course (and is not one of the technical courses the major) I am GLAD that it IS EASY. I would not take her for a technical course where I really want to learn.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDIwOTgx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Group projects--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSE3801","date_posted":"2019-01-05 07:34:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"I got an A in this class but you have to be very careful. Make sure you read &amp; do well in her quizzes &amp; assignments. Never miss or be late to turn them in because you won't survive the penalty.

Thankfully you don't need to go to class. Although, she is still better than most CCSE Profs, but that says more about the CCSE department than her. You can do a presentation about your group project for an extra 10%.

The final we took was ugly. Not like I do not understand the material but it was like a word puzzle. You had to read it many times and then there was only one word different from the definition.

She put the final exam up for only two hours of the day, never seen professor to that in an online class.
