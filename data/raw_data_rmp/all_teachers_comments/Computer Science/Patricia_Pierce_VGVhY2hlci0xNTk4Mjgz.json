She begins the semester as if everyone knows how to code which is not true. The homework/projects/labs are all straight forward, but her inconsistent grading drove me up the wall. Get the textbook since her tests are open-book.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzEwMDk2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSE1301","date_posted":"2019-04-28 19:50:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the toughest grader I have ever had. I was only able to squeak out a 85 average on my labs while my friends were getting 98's for the same work with other professors. The midterm and final count for 50% of your grade. Oh, did I mention that the average for the midterm was a 40-something? Yeah, DO NOT TAKE HER unless you enjoy failure lol.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjk5MDI2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSE1311","date_posted":"2018-05-10 21:59:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Everything is open book.

I am not, and it was difficult. She has a lot of grades that go into your final grade. Didn't do so well on the tests but the labs, projects, and homework made up for it. She grades pretty easily, just answer and youll get partial credit. Her lectures are pretty dry and boring.

She's not located in state, but she's extremely interactive in the course. She gave us her phone number and (long) hours and lets us text/call when we need help. Reads all assignments and gives feedback. She's also very encouraging and really wants us to succeed.

She is usually able to explain things in a way that makes sense to most people, but it all comes straight from the textbook. The lab assignments are very helpful in understanding the material, and the projects will test you, but are easy enough if you apply yourself.
