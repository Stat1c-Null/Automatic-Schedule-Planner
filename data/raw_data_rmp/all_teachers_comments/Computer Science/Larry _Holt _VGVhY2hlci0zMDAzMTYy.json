My main issue is how long it takes him to communicate. He can either respond within the next few hours or for another 2 days.

The course is based on a dated textbook (good read  though) and the quizzes for them are not lockdown browser. There's a very mediocre lab that comes with this class you have to pay for and the tests are very heavy on your grade. Beware the tests as the teach will grade strictly.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzIwNTQ3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Cybr4200","date_posted":"2024-04-23 17:09:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is among the worst I have taken. He is part time so he does not truly care about how you are doing in the class. His feedback does not always align with how the directions were given and does not give any leniency. Was very rude in his email responses and did not care to help anyone with their questions. Very difficult to work with.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjM4NDc1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Cybr4200","date_posted":"2024-04-20 19:15:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall, the professor doesn't give you any chances. Assignments seem to have to be done the way the professor likes it or its not accepted. This is my second time taking the class with the same professor. The comments left on discussions and writing assignments by prof are harsh. All assignments are do by 5pm, so if you have a job won't recommend.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjE3NTA0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"F","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
