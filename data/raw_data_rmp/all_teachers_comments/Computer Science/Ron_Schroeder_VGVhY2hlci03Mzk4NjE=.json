I thought I was going to get a D in the class but I got an A so the curve was obviously amazing. Boring class (its required), boring teacher (only one who teachers it), but its an easy A as long as you somewhat pay attention in class.

But in the end he did curve the grades because i somehow got an A. Class is incredibly boring, and he is horrible at teaching the content, but its not that hard to pull off and A after the curve.
