Quizzes in D2L (autograded). Online resources are a joke... lecture videos with poor audio even worse PowerPoint slides. She canceled the group project the week before finals. Info in syllabus is outdated/wrong. I want a refund.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTIyMjc0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"F","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1321","date_posted":"2025-07-14 02:42:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class was nothing special. She's nice, but young so not very good at teaching. She basically just reads off the power points and does some example code here and there. Python assignments each week, quiz each module and exams are just the quiz questions. Final group project. Easy A but maybe if I was a CS major I'd have enjoyed the class more.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTQ3NTk2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1321","date_posted":"2025-05-12 06:26:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Don't take her for an online class.
