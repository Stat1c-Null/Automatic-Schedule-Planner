There are two types of assignments to keep track of: (i) weekly labs and (ii) weekly homework exercises, and she's available to help if you need it. Final is 50% of the grade, but she prepares thoroughly for it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjM5NDY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

I enjoyed her lectures! She also left examples related to our labs on the board when we were working on new material.
