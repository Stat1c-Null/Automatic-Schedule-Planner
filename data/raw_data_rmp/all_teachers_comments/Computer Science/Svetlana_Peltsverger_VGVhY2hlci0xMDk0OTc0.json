You will learn alot from her class if you study. However, I didn't enjoy the labs because they took forever to complete. She also has an attitude at times when you ask a question.

I had her for multiple classes.  If you do the core work and try to elaborate with some sort of creative input and you'll succeed.  Heavily qualified with education, certification and experience.

The only reason I go to class is attendance's point which is 10% of your grade. Her accent is just so annoying. You won't understand anything that she said.
