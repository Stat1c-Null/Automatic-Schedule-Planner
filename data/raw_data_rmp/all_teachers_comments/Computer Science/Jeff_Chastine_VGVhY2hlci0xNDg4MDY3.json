His lectures were amazing and he's a fantastic person who really knows what he's talking about. He loves talking about the material and he gives you tons of great information. Tests are a little challenging but if you study what he tells you to and pay attention you should ace them. Great course.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Nzg4MjYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS4413","date_posted":"2014-07-24 12:22:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Jeff Chastine is probably the best professor in the state of Georgia.

He is extremely helpful and he treats his students like adults. The only downside of his class is his TA. He grades so strictly and you can't get a good grade on written assignments.
