All are cumulative, and there is far too much subject material to memorize in preparation for them, and she gives no guidance on what to expect or prepare for. Wildly inconsistent amount of questions per quiz.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjUwNTE1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE6653","date_posted":"2023-10-18 19:48:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"I've had this professor for three classes now. Her lectures are just mountains of slides with no clear emphasis put on anything. Your tests will amount to trying to memorize everything you possibly can since you never know what will show up.
