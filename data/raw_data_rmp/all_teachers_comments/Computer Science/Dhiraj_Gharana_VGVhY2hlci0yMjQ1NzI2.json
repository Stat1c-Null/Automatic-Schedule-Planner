He shows up late to class and puts assignments back and never explain what he's talking about in class he usually will say \"WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT LATER\" but you guys will never talk about it . He gives out extra credit to help out. But I wouldn't recommend you take him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDg4Mzc0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS1301","date_posted":"2017-04-19 21:19:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Gharana means well, but sadly he just is not good at teaching. He gets very sidetracked and all of his work is unorganized and hard to follow. I'm giving him a 2 because he is truly a nice guy, but in my opinion that is his only positive attribute. Shows up late to class himself a lot, does not follow the syllabus, barely any structure to class","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDgzMDY3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS1302","date_posted":"2017-04-11 12:56:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I wish I could give Prof. Gharana a good grade on this site, I really wish I could - but I can't. He's currently a Ph.D. student at the University and understandably, his Ph.D. work is more important to him then teaching his students - which sucks for us.  He's a good guy, he just doesn't know what he's doing.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDMwMjMy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":6,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
