All tests were take home, open-book style puzzles to solve. He would lecture in class about the math/inner-workings of a particular AI topic, and then you would do a related hw prob. I liked his approach to engage w/ students on a high level.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzUwMDAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3642","date_posted":"2024-04-30 21:42:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Choi is very knowledgeable and passionate in his work. He made the assignments and tests easy even though they were each take-home. However, I felt like his non-traditional lecture style was hit or miss. He would discuss many theories and math concepts, but never really directly tell us, \"this is what AI does\" so I was confused often.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzE4MjA0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS3642","date_posted":"2024-02-29 02:33:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Feels more like a friend explaining concepts to you than a lecture. The class is comfortably paced and has loose HW due dates. REALLY into his professional research which is reflected in his course. can always back up lessons with the math proofs when questioned, never says 'just bc' or 'idk', which leads to sidetracking into alot of math lol 10/10","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDEwNjQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS6041","date_posted":"2022-12-15 21:04:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Excellent teaching and course content! Good flow! Attend every class to catch up with the knowledge that he delivers! Uses board, not ppt - grasp as you go. We won't forget once he teaches - he is that good! One of the best professors for me at KSU. Have an interest in learning for the future. Be relaxed and learn a lot with no stress!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTQyNTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
