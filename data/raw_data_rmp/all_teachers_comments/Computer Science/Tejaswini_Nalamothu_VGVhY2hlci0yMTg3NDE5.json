She's terrible at responding to emails, usually just doesn't email back. Basically, shows up to class, gives her lecture then checks out. Online quizzes weren't opened on time.

It's whatever is convenient for her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDcwMzIz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CS1301","date_posted":"2018-05-07 16:18:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Nalamothu was great! The lectures are PowerPoint heavy, but she is still very engaged with the learning process. She cares about her students and about how well they understand the concepts. Due to the nature of the subject, she is very understanding when it comes to grading issues. Highly recommend taking her for programming.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDEzMzg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS1302","date_posted":"2018-04-25 18:20:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor.

She understands the material, but isn't good at presenting it. She just reads off of a PowerPoint, so you are going to have to learn a lot on your own.
