Very respectful, and eager to help, and he graded fairly. The difficulty rating is more to do with the course than him, learning how to use a game engine is tough but he made it much easier to learn. If you have issues just communicate with him and he'll help you out.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjY3MjAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDD2012","date_posted":"2021-12-11 01:12:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Justus is new to teaching but you couldn't tell if he didn't say that. He's very caring, gives great lectures, has lots of extra credit opportunities, and just has a very fun class overall. He's also very forgiving, if you miss an assignment due to something he'll usually be understanding and give you another shot. I can't recommend him enough!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDY1OTM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CGDDL2012","date_posted":"2021-04-28 17:47:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great person who truly cares about students succeeding. Was always willing to help out when stuck and responded to emails promptly. I strongly recommend people come in with some Unity game development experience. By the end of this lab course you will have to make a game that uses some advance programming skills. Do as many tutorials as you can!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjQ3Nzc2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
