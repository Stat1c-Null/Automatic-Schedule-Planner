But he doesn't seem familiar with all assignment requirements and sometimes they stump him too! While generally good with responding to email, I wouldn't count on a last-minute question being answered; discussion boards aren't really addressed either. Good GTA overall (funny!), but he wouldn't be my first choice.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTkzNTk2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSE1321","date_posted":"2018-12-05 12:26:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lab grades are assessed during class, so if you dont go you wont get a grade. Luckily the actual lab check off is only like 10% of your grade, final 50% and the other 40% comes from HW(Assignments). Their is probably about ten actual mins of teaching and the remainder 1.5 hours is sat thinking into outer space trying to figure out how to code.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODc0MzU1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Only thing that kinda frustrated me was that EVERY assignment after If-else statements were over stuff we have never learned from lecture and were expected to figure out on our own","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTkxNjIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Skip class?
