Deciphering what this professor wants is harder than the assignments themselves, and good luck getting an email for clarification. The final questions require the book, so be prepared to have it before you open the midterm (ie out of town like me).","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTU2NTg3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSE1311","date_posted":"2017-10-26 08:05:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was online. He is a hard and difficult grader. He wants the answer exactly how he prefers. Garrett goes strictly off the book.

Nice guy, bad teacher. your time is better spent on google at home than it is sitting in class. doesn't allow you to go ahead and apply new things. barely speaks English and often will answer a question similar but unrelated to what you ask","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTU1OTY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"3153","date_posted":"2014-10-30 20:36:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Barely has command of the English language. You usually end learning everything you need to know in the last 10 minutes of class. He usually shows up late, then teaches late.

Belittles students when they get things wrong on assignments. Not only did he comment on things that I got wrong, but he also commented on anything I got right with \"Surprisingly, you got this right\"  Barely speaks English, you will do nothing but diagrams up to AT LEAST the midterm.

But he does not know how to teach. Have several unnecessarily difficult assignments with vague goals and vague grading schemes. Not a firm grasp on the English language.
