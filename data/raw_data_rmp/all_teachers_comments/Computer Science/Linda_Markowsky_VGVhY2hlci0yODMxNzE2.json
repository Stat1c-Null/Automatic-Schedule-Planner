She would absolutely make sure you left the class intrigued and knowing the material. Plus, she brings in guest lectures that make the class exciting.

She provided practice quizzes, dropped the lowest quiz grade, created review videos for the tests and had extra credit opportunities. I so wish she would have remained my professor because she was very caring and replied to students' emails with respect and compassion.
