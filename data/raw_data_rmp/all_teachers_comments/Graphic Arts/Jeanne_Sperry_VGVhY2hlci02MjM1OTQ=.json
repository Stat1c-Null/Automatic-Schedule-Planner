She can be disorganized and unclear. Just ask her again. She can be tough - stick with it. Don't miss class, be on time, don't call her by her first name. If you stick with the program and work hard, she'll respect you, love you, and open up to you. A great professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExMzI5MjUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART","date_posted":"2005-05-21 14:09:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the toughest teacher I have ever had. She is a working designer and gives real world advice. If you want to be a good designer, she is the best professor in the department. Never be late, never call her by her first name, always go by her office and ask for her advice...and she will like you. She was taught by Milton Glaser himself!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDE0MTY=","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
