For example, she gave lectures but didn't provide many notes or important info for future reference on D2L. Her feedback should've been more detailed too. \nShe gave us opportunities to practice skills in class and wanted us to succeed. We had plenty of readings at our disposal too.

Grade is based on participation, online quizzes from the book, and about 4 major assignments. Does examples and exercises in class that help with major assignments and gives her own examples of each. Follow the examples on the assignments and you should get an easy A. She's very laid back and flexible with assignment due dates.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NjM3OTc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IDC6002","date_posted":"2014-11-26 00:11:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Palmer expects high quality work. She seems to care about her students and enjoy seeing the learning process unfold. If you put in legitimate effort in class, you'll find her easy to understand and build a great rapport with. She has a sense of humor. Her lectures are interesting, relevant, and timely. Projects are useful in the real world.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzODk1NzE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3015","date_posted":"2012-12-08 21:33:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Palmer is a very nice person and has very high standards. You learn a lot in her courses (I have had her 2 times). However, you have to work hard for an A. She teaches graduate classes and sometimes it felt like we were held to the same standard as graduate level students. Overall, I got an A in both classes I took. You have to work for it!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTkzOTA0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM2010","date_posted":"2010-06-06 15:18:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's lots of fun in class, the assignments aren't too hard, and all you have to do is follow her examples on the website where the assignments are posted.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MzA3OTY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IDC6180","date_posted":"2009-05-15 17:29:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"She definitely piles on the work, so if you are not ready to work, don't take the class.
