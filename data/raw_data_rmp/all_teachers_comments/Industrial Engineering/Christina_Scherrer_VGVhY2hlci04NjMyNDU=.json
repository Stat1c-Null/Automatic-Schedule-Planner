She grades overly too hard and nitpicks everything on exams, they are not well created being unclear at times and sometimes too long you run out of time. Her practice exams are way easier than the actual. She takes attendence which is unnecessary and accuses people of wrongdoing.

Trust me, if you show up to every class, you will get an A. She grades attendance, so be sure to go to class.

Says the group did good on a paper but then fails us. No point in buying the book because it is useless when she teaches.
