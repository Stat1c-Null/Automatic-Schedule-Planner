She was so hard and logistics is such an easy concept. I studied the powerpoints and watched all pre-recorded lectures and it still wasn't enough.

Inconsiderate of your time because she makes you play a supply chain game TWICE and it is very time consuming. Convinces you to buy the textbook but you do not need it. I promise!
