He will not get to know you and seems annoyed to be here. Part of the purpose of this class should have been to teach what the different IET professions are, but he did not. Do not purchase the textbook before class because he will probably not use it. I got an A in this class, but I do not recommend this teacher.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NjI0MjQ4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET4427","date_posted":"2008-05-09 12:04:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"PROS: Clear and thorough lecturer; Very organized and structured; Wealth of actual industry experience; Attendance optional; Did not collect homework; Only held class one day a week instead of two; Easy grader.
