You will be amazed simply by the breadth of knowledge that he has. The lectures were recorded because of COVID but he is always available for questions and explanations. The coursework is tough, but he grades fairly.

Took Professor Khalid for the aero minor classes. He is very good at what he does. Extremely knowledgeable. You will have to work hard in his classes but it's worth it. I learned so much! Lots of homework, project in each class, and tests are challenging. He usually curves at the end. Overall, so glad I took class with him. 100% recommend","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzIzMTIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISYE4802","date_posted":"2020-12-09 05:22:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Khalid is a wonderful professor, but Helicopter Theory is a beast of a class. Pay attention to the lectures and take notes. The tests were challenging but definitely manageable. Do yourself a favor and start your homework early. This goes triple for the group project.

Aircraft Propulsion may be my favorite class that I've taken in my entire degree. The material can be somewhat challenging at first but Dr. Khalid is always available to help if you ask him. 2 tests, 7 hw, quizzes on Friday, and a group project (start early). Grades very fairly.

To add to that, his teaching style isn't helpful and A LOT of outside study and practice is required to even hope to do well. Can easily be a very tough grader when he wants to, but if you're lucky he will give straight-forward open notes tests you can do well on.
