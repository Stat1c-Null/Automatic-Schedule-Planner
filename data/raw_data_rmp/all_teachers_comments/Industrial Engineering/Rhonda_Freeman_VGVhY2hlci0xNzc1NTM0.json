No tests in this class, so it was 100% project based. Really gets you thinking in systems and there are really no long answers so long as you give support for your assertions and elaborate heavily. I hope to have her again in the future.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODEyNzkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IET2227","date_posted":"2012-12-04 22:51:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class is a hybrid class, so you meet once a week in class. prior to coming to class it is recommended that you attempt the module lecture and HW, which will make this class much easier. She will go over any HW problems you have and will explain harder concepts.
