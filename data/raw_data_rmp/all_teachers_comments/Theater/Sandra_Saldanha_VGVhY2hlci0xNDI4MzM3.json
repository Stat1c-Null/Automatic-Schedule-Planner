I question whether her choice to become a professor was a last resort type of situation if all else failed, because she isn't a very good one. Her lectures were so unclear and uninteresting -- it was head numbing. But She is an extremely kind, understanding, and worldly woman.

I only took it with her to get it out of the way to take upper level courses. She was fair with grading. I came out with a B.
