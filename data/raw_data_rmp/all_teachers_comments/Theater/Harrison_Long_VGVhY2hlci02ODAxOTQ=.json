Prof. Long helped me step out of my comfort zone and trust other people. He made me confront myself and face my actions.

His passion for teaching could be seen in every moment of the class. His relation of the material to the students was crystal clear. He wants the best for his students.

I have taken both Acting I and Acting II with him, and his class has been the most beneficial.

He'll definitely put you through the ringer, but it's all for your own benefit as an actor. I deeply appreciate the amount of work and energy he puts into teaching acting.
