It was my first semester in college, and not only did she help students with the course material, but she also was a great guide to new students. We had super interactive lectures, played some theatre games, read and discussed some important plays, and more. Would 100% rec. :)","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Njc4NDM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107","date_posted":"2024-04-26 21:56:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy class.

She is sweet and caring, her assignments are fairly easy. We had small assignments and like 2 quizzes based on a reading but they were super easy as long as you read. Most of our grade was made up of the performance responses and instead of a final, we had a project, which wasn't hard because she broke it down over a few weeks.
