Online quizzes on D2L. 3 MANDATORY plays you must buy tickets for/see, then answer reflection essays for. 100s on all mine- pay attention and answer the ?s. Need the textbook, some quizzes are from there. Books to read I was able to find online so didn't buy them. No final, just play you have to write/perform. She's nice/helpful.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTQxMTgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2013-12-08 00:48:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"She grades the final reflection essay to harshly, especially for a gen ed class. You would think that this class would not be that hard considering it is a gen ed, but it's not. Quizzes are easy, but essays and discussions are long and she grades them too harshly.
