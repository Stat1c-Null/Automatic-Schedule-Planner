He does not expect you to be the next Denzel Washington, he just expects you to come to class willing to learn. He also gives criticism in the most constructive way so that no one is upset afterwards. If you can fit his class in your schedule, do it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNTU3NzQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS2203","date_posted":"2016-11-01 22:30:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"He really goes above and beyond for his students. He leads discussions in a way that makes it easy for students to participate. He is good at getting the best out of students by wording things in a way that makes sense. Also, he is readily available to help with anything students may need and he gives many opportunities for extra credit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTExNDkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
