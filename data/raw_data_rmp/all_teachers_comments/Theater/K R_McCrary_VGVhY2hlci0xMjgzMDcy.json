I did not find it interesting, there are alot of mandatory attendance days and boring lectures.  3 even responses and HUGE group project.  If you get a bad group..get ready to do alot of work.

Her class was fun, and if you actually get involved in it, you will enjoy it alot. She is VERY understanding, and personally helped me out alot durring the semester. She's young and very energetic. Basically, her class wasnt a monotonus snore fest. I deffinately suggest taking her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTM3MTYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2009-12-07 16:33:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very extensive for a gen-ed class! More than 3 out of class events and papers, every assignment was outside of class which used up a lot of extra time. She is clearly inexperienced/new so she acts very tyranty in class. Over the top at times. She tries to be helpful/nice, but her class is very cluttered and we were always playing catch up.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDg3MTk5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2009-12-01 14:00:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's an okay teacher, a little eccentric, but very helpful when you need it. She's not very good at WebCT, but when she makes mistakes or if yours isn't working, she gives you second and third chances. One thing- DO NOT BE THE WEB MASTER.

Waaay too much work for a gen ed, intro course. Outside, late evening, required events 3+ times during the semester.  More than a handful of tests/quizzes, but all on WebCT, which she doesn't really know how to use because she's new-ish.

She is new, so she doesn't really understand WebCT very well and sometimes isn't clear about what and where stuff is. Lots of extra credit opportunities!! The play is challenging if you have no theatre experience, but just try hard and you will do fine.

It also really interferes with life out of class b/c the tests, quizzes, and plays are all done outside of class. 6 quizzes,3 papers,3 tests,tons of extra credit.Final is a group project(randomly assigned)where your group has to write, direct,act,design, etc your own play.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Nzg2NzA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
