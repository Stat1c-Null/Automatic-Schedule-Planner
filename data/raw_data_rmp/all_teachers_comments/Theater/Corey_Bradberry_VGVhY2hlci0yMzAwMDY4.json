The syllabus says attendance isnt mandatory but he ended up putting in an &quot;attendance and participation&quot; grade that came out of nowhere. The class itself isnt hard as long as you do the online work and go to the plays.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODkwNTcz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--GROUP PROJECTS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
