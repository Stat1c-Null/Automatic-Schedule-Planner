Class usually starts with notes and ends with some activity that's fun to do/watch. She also gives about 3 extra credit opportunities. We had to go to about 3 plays, read about 3 scripts, and take about 10 quizzes with 10 questions each, not including the 35 question online exams (2). I had fun!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTIwODEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--EXTRA CREDIT--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
