Don't take her class if you're unwilling or unable to commit to the attendance policy, but all of her expectations WILL make you a better student. She grades critiques a little harsh, so make sure you go above and beyond. Her class is extremely entertaining, challenging, and will awaken unrealized potential.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzYyMjc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1713","date_posted":"2011-11-03 18:04:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome teacher!!!

Attendance is basically mandatory because everyday you have to work with your group to contribute. No textbook required. You will have fun and learn something at the same time.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4ODUwMjMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
