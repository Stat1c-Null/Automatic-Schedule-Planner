There are times when the class in challenging...but in a good way. There are a lot of online quizzes because you read a lot of plays but as long as you read it you are set. She is so fun though and her class was my favorite my freshman year. Recommended!

She makes class interesting, and isn't afraid to call you out if you're causing trouble.  Def pick TPS1107 and her over art or music.  She's great.
