She spends so much time outside of class picking out the perfect monologues and scenes for every student she has. If you don't miss a lot of class and you put in the effort, you'll pass. Lots of writing, but it's not unbearable.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDkzNTgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS2203","date_posted":"2021-11-15 13:40:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Professor Long for beginning acting. Long is approachable and in her class all are comfortable in participating, as the class is heavy on involvement. Assignments include theatre critiques, an open scene, a scripted scene, monologues, and a mock audition as the final. Long cares a lot about students and is willing to work with individuals.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjM5NTU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
