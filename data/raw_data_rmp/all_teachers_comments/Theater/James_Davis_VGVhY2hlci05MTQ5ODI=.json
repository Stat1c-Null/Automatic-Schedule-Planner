Lots of group projects and independent reading for plays, required to see shows outside of class. As a theatre major, I loved this class. He's a really funny guy, but sometimes his grading and feedback is a little vague. Would take again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTk2ODAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2020-07-26 05:56:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took TPS 1107 w/ Prof Davis for my gen ed requirement. His class was harder than what it should have been. I took his 4 week class and there were at least 10 assignments we had to do. I only made A's on a few. Tough grader on everything, with minimal feedback. Tests were over things we haven't learned. Nice guy, but his passion for theatre shows","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTM0NTkw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Get ready to read--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2018-05-27 21:52:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is an okay professor. Each paper says you are not graded on acting ability, but you are. I am a bio major and don't know how to act and just took this class cause I had to. I spent hours on a play and yet failed so if you don't know how to act, you'll end up getting a bad grade. I wouldn't take him again..","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTk4NjI3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--Skip class?

If you attend the mandatory  plays, pay attention to the lecture and can write something interesting, you get an A. He assigns the groups for the final project early in the semester, take it seriously and vote out any group member that isn't helping, he grades  the final strictly.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODk5NzYy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2014-09-09 11:26:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"His exams are online, he doesn't let you go back to previous answers, he's not open to talking to you about assignments.

He does grade on the hard side but he gives good feedback and the opportunity to correct your work.  He definitely gives you the tools to succeed, but it is up to you to use them.  Do the work when he assigns it and talk to him, and you will do well.

He's vey laid back, but grades hard. He expects students to know and remember how to apply what was taught in 1101 Comp. When he says to bring something, you better bring it or you'll get points off. Not terribly easy, but if you do the work and show up, you'll probably pass.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mjk3MzQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
