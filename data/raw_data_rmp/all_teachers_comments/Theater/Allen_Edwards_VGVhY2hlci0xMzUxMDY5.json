A lot of Extra Credit opportunities. The tests are hard so beware. You have discussions after seeing mandatory plays, they are graded tough but fair. The quizzes are straight from the book. Overall, an A or B is easy to achieve. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTE2NjE2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2013-01-09 23:35:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is  very enthusiastic about theater. If you don't really care much about theater, his tests will take you forever! They are usually 50 questions, online. Most of the questions are hidden in the textbook. There's always a quiz once a week. He assign's essay's and grades them critically. He gives plenty of extra credit opportunities. Nice guy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjM5MDU4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2012-11-12 14:10:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really liked his class. His lectures are interesting. Quizzes are easy. I barely read the book. If you want to do well on tests, take notes in class. His tests are based on lectures and his quizzes are from the book. You have to see play, but that's no big deal. Overall easy and glad I took it! Attendance mandatory for some classes towards end.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE3Nzc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2012-07-10 13:30:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"He likes to talk, the course material is easy to grasp. Make sure you have free time to see the plays he assigns. There is a really dumb group play where you don't get to pick your group so be prepared to work with a group that may not give a crap.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDgwMTcz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2012-05-07 19:03:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Make sure you just follow the syllabus.

Gave great constructive criticism after acting assignments. Daily written assignment is due though and required more writing for this class than my English class.

(He's 50-plus.) I didn't think he was a very good teacher either - he never finished a lecture because he would ramble on about the most unimportant topics and he never picked up next class with the rest of the material.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjE5MDk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2010-11-05 02:58:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Edwards' class is pretty easy.
