Doesn't give clear directions for major projects. Harsh attendance policy. He does try to get people to focus on things that interest them, which is nice, but does so without paying any mind to how much time it would eat up.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDI5NTcx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--So many papers--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS4513","date_posted":"2023-08-17 06:20:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Well, I've never been overwhelmed on the first day of class, so that's a first. Got hit with a ton of work and a ton of reading, it just already feels like an uphill battle. But he's a nice guy, very passionate, encourages critical thinking, and caring, so I'd be open to taking another class with him, just not this one.

This is my second time taking his class and I've never had any problems. You can tell that he truly enjoys teaching and educating students about the subject being taught. He's one of my favorite professors here at KSU. I definitely recommend taking his class if given the opportunity.

Apparently Jim Davis taught the same class and students were better off. No study guides. Test questions from lectures. Will use decimals in your grade. Really tough grader. Being late will lower your participation grade. For an A: participate a lot and ask for help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjI4NjM5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
