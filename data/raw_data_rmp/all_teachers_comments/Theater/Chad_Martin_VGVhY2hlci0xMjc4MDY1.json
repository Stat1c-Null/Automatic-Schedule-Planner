Have to meet online every couple of weeks for group project MANDATORY. Don't expect quick reply to email. I emailed 5 days ago with no reply. AWFUL teacher. More work than my 3-4000 level English classes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTI3OTIx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2011-05-09 08:43:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Martin is the worst about putting grades up.  He's pretty helpful.  The class is a standard gen ed class and the assignments he gives are basically the ones that all the other online TPS 1107 classes do.  However, the online logins are mandatory and if you do not go to all of them, you may fail the class. Group project is a lot of work","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTU3Mzgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2010-11-21 21:04:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class online and it required entirely too much work!! You have 1-2 quizzes a week, at least 2 to 3 discussion posting topics a week, 2 mandatory play attendances, an exam and a group project.  He never grades anything so you have no clue where you stand in the class.  He takes forever to answer emails, sometimes up to a week.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODAyMzg0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2010-07-26 21:31:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE HIM ONLINE. He never grades anything so you have no clue what you're grade is. He gives a ridiculous amount of course work and it took up WAY too much of my summer. Take someone else if AT ALL POSSIBLE. There are also mandatory logins each week so if you have a life during the summer... good luck!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDUyNDc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2010-04-21 13:32:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"He takes his class super seriously and loves to talk. The class isnt too bad if you dont mind listening to him talk the whole time. He is nice and easy to work with. All tests and quizzes are online. The final is your group project play. You get to pick parts in it and its really easy. :) take him, the class isnt bad","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDMzMTc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2009-11-03 13:51:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Martin is boring and takes roll at every class. Online quizzes allow you two attempts which is nice. It's not hard but he does give some busy work and ridiculous outside assignment responses on plays. I'd take someone else,  but he's not horrible","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzA2MDU2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2009-05-22 16:15:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice guy.  I had his class last summer.  When it go to covering other art besides theater, he was pretty clueless.  He was good.  Probably not the best, but if you have to take him, he's not bad.  Takes roll at the beginning of every class, and there is a group play you have to create.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODg1OTQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
