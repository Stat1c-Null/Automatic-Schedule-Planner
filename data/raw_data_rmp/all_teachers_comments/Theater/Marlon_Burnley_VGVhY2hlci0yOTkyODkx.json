He didn't give a syllabus all semester (against KSU policy), didn't give clear criteria for the assignments or due dates. Also, wasnt there 7 times even though if students miss 2 classes we get docked a letter grade. Easy grader though, just a bit frustrating","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDYzMTMx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS2290","date_posted":"2025-03-14 05:30:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Genuinely one of the worst professors. He never clearly told us what he wanted for his assignments or how they would be graded. We literally never got a syllabus for the class. Very unaccessible outside of class or through email. He doesn't teach, leaves class and hands it over to TA. Just a terrible professor. His class was a huge waste of time.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzcwNTUx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS2290","date_posted":"2024-03-16 03:39:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Marlon is a super kind guy and a great professor. He gives great industry advice and we learned a variety of different forms of creation and performance. You are encouraged to participate. He creates a supportive and safe environment and is always sure to check in on comfort levels. This class was a great introduction to the TPS program.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDU1MTg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
