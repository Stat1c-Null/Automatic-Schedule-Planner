I learned nothing. This was more of a History of Ed Palumbo class than TPS. If you ask a question he will dance all around it and not give an answer. Totally rude! WORST TEACHER EVER! Hope KSU doesnt rehire him!!!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzgwNTM4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2010-10-22 10:27:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the worse teacher I have ever had.  I would rather watch paint dry.  We don't use the book and he changes the syllabus constantly.  There is no structure what so ever.  He says one thing and then changes it.  I learned absolutely nothing.  He talks about useless things in class that doesn't pertain to theatre at all.  DON'T DO IT.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjgyMzU0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
