She is very particular about what she wants. You will ONLY pass this class with extra credit, that's why there's so much of it. Participation is a must, perfect attendance means nothing without it. Extremely harsh grader, her B's are D's.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzc2Mjg1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
