Loved her class. Until she accused me of AI and copying other students in the last week. It'd be quite hard to use AI on a production response for a production that IS NOT ON THE INTERNET AT ALL. Instead of a high B I got a D.

She lacks understanding at times. I think she would have been great in person, definitely not online. It's an easy course, but her unattentiveness makes it more challenging. \n","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTYzODY2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107","date_posted":"2025-05-05 17:52:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lots of great reviews because this is a pretty straightforward class. However, Samantha Elkins made it more difficult with consistent errors with the modules and content, no updates, no announcements, and some assignments felt like they were out of the blue&#8212;no feedback on essays, and not a good emailer.

You need to participate in class because she assigns you to a group for a group projects, which is your final exam at the end of the semester.

In her class she requires that you see three plays and write an essay on each of them, you also have to pay for your own ticket.

Got a 100 on basically everything in class. It's straight forward and very easy as long as you follow directions.
