Doesn't grade harshly. Textbook wasn't really needed. The class can get expensive b/c you're required to see 2 school plays and 1 professional out of school play. Only allowed 2 unexcused absences.

His energy is great and he really knows a lot about theatre and is very passionate. He can get serious at times but only really when it was necessary, and he would quickly get back to the light-hearted side.
