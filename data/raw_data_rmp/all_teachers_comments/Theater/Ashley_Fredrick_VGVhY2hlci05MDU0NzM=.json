Books only used like 3 times. Attendance affects your grade so show up! Scene work is done, and even a bit of writing due to journals and theatre critiques. You will have to go see shows and practice outside of class time. Tests are hard if you don't open your book at all.

The assignments are always clear and the grade you get is definitely the grade you earned. The books aren't a huge deal, but attendance will determine your grade.
