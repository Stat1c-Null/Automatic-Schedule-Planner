Prof. Brown had us do a group warmup in the beginning of each class, and it allowed you to get to know your classmates for all the group projects. She wasn't the best at grading properly but if you tell her in class she fixes it within a week or two.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzczMjM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2019-05-06 04:09:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awful professor, doesnt grade things and doesnt keep up with due dates.

We got to do Acting warm-ups each class which made it easier for us to feel comfortable around each other since we had to work in groups. She was very passionate about Theatre and was very knowledgeable. The workload was heavy but she took that into consideration when grading. She did not grade hard and I enjoyed the group final!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMjI5NjY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2019-01-04 05:20:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Brown knows her theater material well but takes the class a bit too seriously for a beginner course. The class is essentially one group project where you must make and produce a 10 minute play from scratch. She is bad at keeping track of assignments and their due dates. She also does not answer emails. I would not recommend her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTk4NjM2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2018-10-31 20:18:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is one of the worst professors I've ever had. She takes this intro class way to serious, and assigns hw last minute. She also doesn't grade anything so you wont know what you grade is until late in the semester. There should not be this much of a heavy work load in an intro to Theatre class.

She is very lecture heavy and doesnt give time for anything she assigns. She doesnt know what she wants and changes her assignments constantly so youre in a tornado of assignments and you have no clue what to actually complete.
