There is a written test at the end of the semester with all of the dance terminology, and the textbook is super cheap ($5-10). You can miss up to 4 classes before it affects your grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjczOTk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
