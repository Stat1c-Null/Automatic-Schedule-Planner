She is an amazing teacher and her instructions are very clear. She grades tough but it is the honesty we all need. She is very approachable and I loved all aspects of this class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjY1ODMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
