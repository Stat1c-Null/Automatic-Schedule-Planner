She speaks to her class like adults and asks for feedback. He class was very easy but that does not mean she doesn't require effort. She will do whatever it takes to help you as long as you do your best in her class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDM1NDY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
