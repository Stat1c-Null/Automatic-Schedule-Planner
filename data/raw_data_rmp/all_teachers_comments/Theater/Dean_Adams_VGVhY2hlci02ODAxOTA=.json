At times, it did not seem that he was interested in teaching. Was not clear on the grading system. Did not help with the assignment that was given,too. He challenged you, but did not show or help you achieve the challenge even when you asked for it. I still have not learned anything that will help me with Musical Theat.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTUwMTk0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS3713","date_posted":"2011-11-17 11:47:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjY0MzUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS3403","date_posted":"2011-03-10 15:33:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Adams is funny & knows his stuff. He's had a ton of real world directing experience & it really shows in the classroom. Kids who take TPS 1107 & complain about him are morons. You dislike the class, not him. If you expect him to pay special attention to you in a huge GenEd class (plus his major students) you're delusional. He's my favorite prof.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MjY1Mjky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS3703","date_posted":"2008-05-05 14:42:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was a very nice guy but the class wasnt at all like I thought it would be. It was more on the history side and I didnt like that. Plus, if you arent a Theater major, you have NO chance of getting an A in the class. I got an 80 on every paper along with the other non-majors and I ended with a B in the class no matter how hard I tried.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NDA1NTI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2007-06-25 15:45:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fun in class and helpful if you needed anything outside of class.
