If you do not respond to all the material he will take off points. He is not very good with responding to emails outside of class either. So if you need to reach him the best time would be to speak with him in class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTQwMzg1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS3000","date_posted":"2017-12-12 10:23:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gentile is the type of professor that challenges &amp; intimidates you, but he is also the type of professor you learn the most from. Has high expectations for all of his students and pushes you to meet them. Yeats unit, which is his favorite, so he is very specific and critical during that. Paper at end of class that is optional but do it to get an A.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTQ4MzE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1600","date_posted":"2014-07-18 12:03:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Gentile is the best professor I had last semester.
