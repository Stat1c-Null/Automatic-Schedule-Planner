He's very clear about his expectations. It is a lot of work for a gen ed class but if you just do it you'll breeze through. With all the extra credit he gives I don't know how you don't get an A. I got a 103% in the classâ€¦.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTkyMjU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2014-05-05 00:34:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst teacher I have ever had. He is the sole reason why I was worried that I would lose the hope scholarship. He grades harder than my English teacher does on the responses. He gives random zeros on things then gives no explanation as to why. I have never in my life had this worse of a professor. Do NOT take him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTYzNjY5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2014-03-26 09:56:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hardest gen ed class I've taken. Grades extremely inconsistently and answers every question with another question... He has so sympathy or awareness of all the other work that students have, and is extremely critical about the play reviews we write. Also the group project at the end es extremely difficult and sets you up for a bad grade.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTQ5Mjcx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"THEA1500","date_posted":"2014-01-03 10:06:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class is EXTREMELY challenging for all, especially if you are not a Theater major.  In addition, he goes far beyond the basics and general criteria of theater.  He really challenges you to deeply analyze texts much more thoroughly rather than settling for what lies on the surface.  Still, I think he'd be better suited to teach on a graduate level.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjg5NDc1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1500","date_posted":"2013-12-11 23:32:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Incredibly inconsistent with grading. He needs to come up with a rubric, for use when he finally decides on how he wants to grade. Professor missed more days in class than he allowed in his own syllabus, which caused him to become very disconnected with the class. He still graded as if he had kept up with the syllabus, but missed much material.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTE3NTU3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2013-11-07 22:45:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you're a theatre major, the class is a breeze. If you aren't, while some projects may seem intimidating, they're actually very easy when broken down. The beginning of the semester is a lot of reading, but nothing you can't find a summary for. He's very willing to work with students as far as late work goes, but he does have an attendance policy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjc4NDM2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1107","date_posted":"2013-10-29 19:19:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"A lot of work for just a core class. There are about 3-5 plays (books) that you have to read for online quizzes. Only one is really long. I never take notes, they aren't really needed. He posts the important ones. Attendance is mandatory. You HAVE to look at the syllabus/D2L to stay up to date.

Two really intense projects for the class. I wouldn't recommend this class to someone just getting gen. ed out of the way, only if you are seriously considering doing theatre as your major, as it's required.
