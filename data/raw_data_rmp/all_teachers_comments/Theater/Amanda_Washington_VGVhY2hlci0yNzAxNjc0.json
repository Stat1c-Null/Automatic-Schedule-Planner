Lectures were not that heavy but mostly classroom discussions. There are 3 plays you have to watch outside of class. There are extra-credit opportunities.

She is one of the best professors I've ever had and is extremely understanding and also very fun. The class is pretty project based but they're easy and she always tries to explain things that aren't clear. You do have to write a few things but nothing extreme. Overall a great professor and interesting class.

She's one of the kindest, most understanding profs at KSU. Of course shows are gonna be mandatory to watch, because it is a theatre course! Don't expect an easy A, but if you are having a bit of difficulty, she's more than willing to work with you. So funny and caring, too &lt;3","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTY5NzQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2021-12-15 00:48:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fine professor, never had any troubles with her personally. Answered emails, usually a day later. Everything was straight-forward and easy from the get go. If you stayed on top of things like buying tickets it was fine.

Never answered any emails.
