I enjoyed his class so much that I went to every single class even though attendance wasn't required. He is so funny, tells great stories, makes class interesting, and is easy on the eyes. He's very passionate about what he teaches and I really learned a lot in his class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTU5NDkx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2015-11-06 14:00:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super funny and has tons of life experience. He's traveled all over as an actor and has lots of stories. Be prepared to take an insane amount of notes. You'll need them and the book for the quizzes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzU5MDUx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2015-11-06 11:48:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Morgan is one of my favorite professors at KSU. I entered this class not knowing if how much I would enjoy it, but he made everything so interesting. He referenced a lot of popular movies to explain some concepts which I really enjoyed. All of his quizzes and tests are online which made it even easier to pass. He was great. Take him!!!!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzU4MTQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2015-10-25 17:00:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Morgan is great. He makes his lectures engaging and you can have a meaningful conversation with him about whatever you happen to be talking about in the theater. He is especially well versed in the horror genre. :D He has taught at a bunch of other universities before, but his humor and personality make him a great professor!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mjg5OTM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
