Attendance mandatory. Quizzes and tests all online. Grades papers a little harsh but the amount of extra credit provided sure helps and almost guarantees an A. Easy A. If you must take TPS she is the one. She is funny. In the beginning acts like she is very strict, but she is really nice.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDI4OTYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2009-10-23 22:18:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Grades VERY harshly, but gives out a TON of extra credit. Very funny, and she knows her theatre. All quizzes and tests are online and multiple choice. It's next to impossible not to get an A. It's the play responses that she grades harshly.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MjY3ODcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2009-05-08 15:23:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a good teacher and is very passionate about theater. her powerpoints speak for themselves so theres really no need for the online text except to access WEBCT. Only complaint is that she gives a LOT of busy work. Easy class overall though. Oh and attendance is mandatory. you can miss like two classes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Nzk2MjA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TPS1107","date_posted":"2009-04-30 11:39:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"She seems scary at first cuz she has so many rules.

She enjoys teaching.  However, she does require you to think.  Hence, the papers...  She is funny, and seems intimidating at first with all the rules and requirements but if you can follow rules then no problem.  She does grade papers as an English teacher.  I am glad the credit hours was moved from 2 to 3.

Considering how much she loves theater you would think she would be teaching upper levels. The group project is the best thing in that class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTUwMjgz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
