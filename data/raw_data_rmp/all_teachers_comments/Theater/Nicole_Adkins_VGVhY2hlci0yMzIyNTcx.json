Super nice &amp; always took her time to explain things and made life easy for all of us. There's a big group project where you do have to act in front of everyone (the class), but don't worry, she is very understanding. She doesn't expect you to be pro.

Almost everyday you get on stage and do something fun and interactive in a group. And unlike other theatre classes you don't read hamlet or perform it you get to write your own play in a group and perform it. If you wanna have a fun class this is the one to take. This class is basically 100% participation.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjY1NzUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TIS1107","date_posted":"2020-05-11 22:21:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Adkins was wonderful.
