Keep in mind this class is mainly for graduating seniors yet he had unreachable expectations even for the brightest of students. Will pick on you too. I am graduating with honors and have never come close to failing a class yet I am with him because he demands 30 minutes per test and a 70 test average or class failed","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODgyMTU0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MET1400","date_posted":"2025-01-31 01:37:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly worst professor I've ever taken. Not because he doesn't know what he teaches but because I truly believe that he is not alright up in there. He had fluctuating mood swings, and frankly does not respect those that do not agree with his mannerisms. He needs to get his act together in terms of communication, despite being a good lecturer","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNjI0Nzcw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MET1400","date_posted":"2023-10-17 21:23:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty meh, and don't be too noticable otherwise he'll pick at you for the rest of the semester. Not to mention the guy let some dude come in 30 minutes late to a test but when I tried to get in 15 minutes (I literally called him twice about how bad traffic was 30 minutes before the test) he wouldn't let me take it(girl btw).","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjgzMzgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MET1311","date_posted":"2022-03-17 15:52:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Kennedy is an excellent professor.  He has lots of real world experience and uses it to help teach his students. He is very strict when wanting students to be in class and on time. Tests and quizzes are always straight forward. He always let us know what we needed to know before we took the test for the chapters. Would easily take again.

He can be very strict and particular about small things like being on time so be prepared.
