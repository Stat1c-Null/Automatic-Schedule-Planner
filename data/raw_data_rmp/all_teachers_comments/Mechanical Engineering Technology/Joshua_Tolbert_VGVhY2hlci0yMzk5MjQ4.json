The only grade that counts is the final but you NEED to do homework to understand the material. Luckily, he will not take off many points for wrong answers, as long as you can show you understand the material and how to problem solve.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzA0MDYw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
