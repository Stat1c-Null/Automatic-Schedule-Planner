He is very big on organization and he gives great partial credit. Provides formula sheets and updates them as the course goes. Many tests but not weighted as heavily so there is room for error. Final isn't cumulative. Simply try your best and you should get a C at least.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mjk1NzE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3122","date_posted":"2022-04-24 02:40:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class synchronous online in fall 2020. His teaching of this subject was very organized and well presented. He worked out difficult problems in class and took time to answer any questions. There are a lot of hard math concepts in dynamics and he explained them clearly and with good problem-solving insight. Tests similar to homework.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MTM4Mjk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3122","date_posted":"2021-05-31 15:05:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is difficult, but I believe this mainly stems from him not being the best professor online. I believe he would be fine in person, but online he is very difficult to pay attention to because he gets very monotone and boring. His grading has very specific criteria but do not know it until after the test, making a 70 very easy, but a 100 very hard.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODc2OTYy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGR3122","date_posted":"2020-12-12 16:43:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dynamics is a hard class but, Mr. Hoyniak does a good job teaching the course. By the end of the semester he gave over 10% worth of extra credit assignments. Also, you will get bonus points if you organize your work neatly on the Exams. Overall, he's a great professor and I would recommend him to others.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDQ1MjI2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3122","date_posted":"2020-05-03 06:39:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"You'll need to do some work outside of class to make sure you really understand everything, but that is true of all classes.
