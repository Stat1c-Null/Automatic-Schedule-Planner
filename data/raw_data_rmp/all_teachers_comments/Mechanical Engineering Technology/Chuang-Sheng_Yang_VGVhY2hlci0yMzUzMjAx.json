Gives old exams as study guides, study that and the hw and you should do well on the exam. Exams are multiple choice, no partial credit so be careful(gives a set curve for test corrections). Has an accent but still understandable.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODMzODkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Test heavy--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3131","date_posted":"2019-04-29 14:17:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Yang is a good professor. His lectures are a little boring and there is a good amount of classwork. Tests can be challenging but as long as you keep up with the course and ask questions, you'll pass. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material, he will make you work for it but if you put in effort, he'll do his best to help you out.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzA0MzM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Test heavy--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2018-05-15 14:23:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Yang is a very lenient and caring man. The homework and quizzes are both very reasonable. The exams are more difficult, and are multiple choice, but he offers a chance to redo your exam for a good amount of points. His lectures can be dry, but he does clearly explain topics and works through examples. I would suggest him to others.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTEzMTU3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR2214","date_posted":"2018-03-22 20:38:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really awesome professor! Explains everything clearly, grades very forgivingly, and really cares about his students. He's easily accessible via email. Homework is short and reflects what's done in class. Only negatives would be that lecture can be boring and tests are harder than homework and quizzes. Still reflects material though.
