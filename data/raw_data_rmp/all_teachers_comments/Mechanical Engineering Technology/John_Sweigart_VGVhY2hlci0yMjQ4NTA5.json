He's typically very late for every quiz and test and is not very clear on what will be on either. He sent the class information about the final on the day of.

He can quiz on very specific things about terminology and formatting. For example, he had a quiz question where you had to know the word torsion from statics. That particular word isn't really taught at my school and it's worth a letter grade on a quiz.

Meaning that if dynamics is a pre-req, you better know dynamics. I took this as a summer course so the material was accelerated and therefore more difficult, but if you put the time into learning it and going to his office hours (this is key), you will succeed.

He reads straight from the book so there no point in going to class. For the past 2 quizzes and test we asked him what to specifically study. He told us but then changes the test last minute. None of what he said was on the quizzes or exam. The problems on the exams were barely covered/ irrelevant.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMDcwMDg3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Test heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MET2322","date_posted":"2019-03-19 22:28:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very un-organized. He has no set lecture plan or homework, does not grade papers in a timely fashion, and he is realy bad at understanding the questions asked in class, and therefore talks around the question.
