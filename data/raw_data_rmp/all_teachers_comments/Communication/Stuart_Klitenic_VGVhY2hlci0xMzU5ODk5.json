People are too sensitive and take it too personal. It is a communication class and he critiques your speech immediately after, that is why it is a communication class.. he is teaching you to communicate better. He is funny and really nice. He also is easy to get a hold of via email. Would take again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDc1OTcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1107","date_posted":"2010-04-17 18:09:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Klitenic teaches a dynamic class. Attendance and participation are a must: he can bump you a grade for it. If you read the textbook, participate in class and review the powerpoints before test you will do fine. If you dread speaking in public don't take the class.

The students are called out in class and berated by this below par instructor. Often forgetting his notes for class and not checking his e-mails. He has latched on to several students and made them favorites. This class is a trainwreck.

He doesn't know the material AT all and simply says what he feels is adequate based off of ppts. His grading is VERY subjective even on tests.
