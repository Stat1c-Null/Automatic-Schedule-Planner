She knows her stuff and will help in anyway she can to help. She's not easy, but she's not hard, you will have to work, but it's fun. She's big on details-proofread everything! If there's ONE mistake, you get a ZERO. Highly recommended!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4ODM4MTYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3360","date_posted":"2011-06-16 13:34:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"She very passionate about what she is teaching!

But to be honest despite all the work, the class was fun, I learned a lot and it was a nice change from another lecture-only course. Be careful with the papers, follow her exact instructions and you'll be fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTYyNzA1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"VISCOM","date_posted":"2010-05-03 20:59:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her power points were exciting. She entertained the class. For the most part, I enjoyed her class. The only problems I had were with her grading and email. She is so stubborn and will not admit she was wrong in grading something. She also never responded to my emails. She was too busy to meet with.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTEyNzAz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2033","date_posted":"2009-05-05 16:57:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a very knowledgeable teacher and loves what she teaches about.
