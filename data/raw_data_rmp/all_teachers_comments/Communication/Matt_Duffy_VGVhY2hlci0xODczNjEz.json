Expect to get a 60 on the writing assignments, as did 90% of the class, but we mostly finished with a B. He's picky.  Would recommend asking for help during his office hours. Attendance not mandatory, but he has quizzes and assignments due in class and you'll get lost.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTgzOTQ1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3330","date_posted":"2016-05-06 17:19:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great guy and knows his stuff but he can be unclear when it comes to assignments. Doesn't always stick to the syllabus & usually just tells personal stories (which are interesting) all class. Expect a pop quiz from reading articles once a week (they're easy). He's cool but I don't feel like I learned a lot or improved as a writer though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDkyNTI5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2135","date_posted":"2016-05-05 17:14:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved his class. You can tell his passion for journalism. I took him for writing for public com so naturally it's a hard class and he has to grade tough. He let me do extra credit at the end of the semester and bumped my grade up. He is willing to help if you reach out to him!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDgwODg5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2135","date_posted":"2016-05-03 21:13:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Duffy is a really cool dude and you can definitely tell that he has a passion for journalism. Just not the Writing class that I was taking, he said that explicitly. If you follow his writing rules and do things his way then you'll do fine in his class. Be sure to be there every class for there is an assignment due every time that we met.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDU2NjQx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2135","date_posted":"2016-03-17 09:19:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very snippy.

It's hard to follow his lectures sometimes and he tends to get his classes confused. He holds you accountable and makes sure you read by giving pop quizzes or some kind of assignment every class.

Study and know the proper AP style grammar. Make sure to bring your AP manual to every class, it will be very helpful! Quizzes are only a few questions, but can be tough. Read the chapters!
