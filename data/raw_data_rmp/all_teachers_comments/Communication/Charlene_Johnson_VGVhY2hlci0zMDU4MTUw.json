This becomes a problem when the instructions are contradictory and vague at best. I am sure she does not intend to come off this way, but the way she responds to emails is concerning. She doesn't create the quizzes, and doesn't know the answers either. Sad.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNDk2MTQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--So many papers--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2020","date_posted":"2025-05-02 20:12:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awful teacher who is dragging the class longer than it is supposed to last just because we have to prove that we presented speeches live. Instructions for assignments are unclear, and she will take points off, even though it isn't your fault because she can't be clear in her instructions.

However, she does not provide clear grading criteria for many of the assignments, making them difficult to complete. She also isn't the easiest grader, and will take points off without providing an explanation as to why they were removed. She is just now putting in a lot of the grades last minute so beware of that.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTIzMDY3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lots of homework","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2020","date_posted":"2025-04-27 16:42:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was an extremely hard grader.

Make sure you manage your time well bc sometimes we only had 2 days to make and present a speech to the class. A lot of classes had \"spotlight challenges\" which were basically improv speeches.
