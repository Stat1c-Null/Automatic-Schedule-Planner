Oh and I could tell that she enjoys teaching this subject so that makes the class feel a lot better.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTE3OTAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2400","date_posted":"2011-12-21 18:19:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"she's kind of hard to get to know because she is not very personable. but she is a great teacher.

You know exactly what she expects on speeches. She can be a rough grader on them. As long as you take a couple hours preparing for each speech, it will show when you deliver it and in your grade.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTQ0ODYw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
