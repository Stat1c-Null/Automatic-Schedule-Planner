She does not hand out grades so you have to do things exactly her way which isn't as bad as it sounds. She is a first year prof but was very helpful based off her experience. Tests are online and very easy. I highly recommend her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTAwODYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
