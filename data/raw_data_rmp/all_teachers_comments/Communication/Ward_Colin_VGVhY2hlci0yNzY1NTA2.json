Very unclear on everything - grading criteria, lecture content, etc...Regular online discussion posts, frequent quizzes, and a few other grades. SO slow to grade - semester is over and no grades past midterm. Will meet w/ students, but so vague it doesn't help. There are EC chances, so take advantage","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjEyMTQ2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2240","date_posted":"2022-04-16 21:01:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely boring, doesn't know how to use D2L, nothing he teaches is on the tests/quizzes, doesn't tell you how to do an assignment until 8hrs before it's due, doesn't respond to emails until last minute, takes forever to grade. He's new to teaching and sometimes he's cool, but I would not advise taking him unless you want a stressful semester.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDg4Njc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2240","date_posted":"2022-04-14 22:35:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Colin is new to teaching and it shows. He's pretty cool, but he is terrible at discussing assignment guidelines and no one ever knows exactly what to do for an assignment. He has weekly quizzes with content that is barely discussed in class. I wouldn't take him again, but he cancels class on Friday's, so that's cool.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDgxNDMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
