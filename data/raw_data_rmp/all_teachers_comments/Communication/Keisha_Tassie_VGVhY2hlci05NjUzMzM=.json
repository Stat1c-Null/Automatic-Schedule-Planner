Her test cover over 100 pages and she only gives 2 tests. DO NOT TAKE!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMDY2OTI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMMSECT","date_posted":"2007-03-13 11:28:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Save your money on tuition and just read the book.  She is inexperienced and brings WAY too much of her personal drama and prejudices to the classroom.  I've never had someone who expects what she does of students who can't even elaborate on or explain what the definition in th text means.  She expects high level work, but gives low level teaching.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyOTE4NDkx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
