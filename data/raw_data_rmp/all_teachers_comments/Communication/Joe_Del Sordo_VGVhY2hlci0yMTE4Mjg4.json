We were taught only the basics before having to create full video projects. That being said, he is lenient on grading &amp; understands we are beginners (however, you need to show you put in effort.) Also, PARTICIPATE in class. He hated our class because no one answered questions.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDIyNjM3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"JOUR3340","date_posted":"2016-10-25 14:21:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Here's how to survive his class:  1. Answer his test questions the way he would, even if he's wrong by all sources apart from his own lectures. 2. When he gives you a chance to ask about questions you got wrong, don't. He'll take it personally and belittle you. 3. Go to class, because of the little lecturing he actually does, it's on the test.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDc2Mjcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

We had 3 projects over the semester, practice camera shots, radio commercial and a video news project.  is not clear with what he wants but an easy A. As long as he thinks you are trying you will make the grade. Very sarcastic.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTUzNDAw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
