Besides the fact that this should have been an easy A, she assumes everyone has public speaking anxiety. On top of that, everyone receives C's regardless of performance and we honestly thought she'd never enter the grades.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODk4NDY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COMM2129","date_posted":"2016-05-11 16:06:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Cancelled half of our classes. NEVER responds to emails. Five speeches, midterm, & final. Tests over random information. Doesn't just give unclear feedback, but hardly any feedback. Still hasn't submitted our final three grades (including the final that was a scantron). Grades are due tomorrow at 5 and I don't expect to see them a minute sooner.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTQyNjMz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2129","date_posted":"2016-05-03 09:59:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"She does not communicate what she expects from her students. She does not review your speeches so you never know if you are getting better or worse.

She cancels class all the time. There's 5 speeches, midterm and final. She gives good feedback if you ever get your grade back. Finals are next week and I have only gotten 1 grade back and its not even in D2L yet.

She cancels class about once a week, and you won't get a heads up 50% of the time. Grades are hard to come by. As I'm writing this, we've had class for a month and a half. We've had three speeches and a midterm. Only the midterm (Scantron, from a website) has been graded. She's funny, though. She's a great person.
