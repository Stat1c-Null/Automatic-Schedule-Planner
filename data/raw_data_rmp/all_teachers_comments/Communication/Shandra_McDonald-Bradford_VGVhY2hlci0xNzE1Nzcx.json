She is unorganized. It is almost like she made it up as she went. I feel like I learned nothing in her class. Her lectures were long and pointless. She didn't know material and was even corrected by students several times. Easy though! Tests are straight from the PowerPoints.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzkxMzgw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1109","date_posted":"2012-05-17 09:43:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a pretty good teacher, the class is just boring. Just go to class every day because she assigns workbook pages. I didn't go to class a lot, but I still got a B. The material is so EASY.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzAxMDIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1109","date_posted":"2012-04-27 16:49:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor teaches in a way that many students find tedious and unhelpful. The lectures are long and drawn-out, very little discussion seems to occur, and using computers to take notes or find relevant information for discussion, while generally encouraged at KSU, seems to be an offense to this professor. Learning in this environment is hard.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTM5MDY5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
