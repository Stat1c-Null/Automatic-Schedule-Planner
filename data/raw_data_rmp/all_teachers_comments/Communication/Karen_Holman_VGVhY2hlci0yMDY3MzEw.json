We had groups assigned and they were never used. If attendance wasn't mandatory I never would've shown up bc her lectures were verbatim from the book. Every person failed one single test and no one knows why because the material isn't hard. still don't know what happened","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDY2Njcw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

From horrible lectures that she doesn't seemed prepared for, grading tests incorrectly, and being plain unqualified it was horrible. If this is the last communication class open and you need it to graduate drop out because life as a college drop out is better.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Mjc3Njg2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COM1000","date_posted":"2016-11-29 16:10:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"She sounds like she has never taught this class before. She only teaches things from the chapter that she likes and doesn't answer any other questions. She is not helpful at all and you shouldn't try and ask questions even if you are lost because she cannot answer the question. She mispronounces words and teaches things incorrectly.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Mjc1ODY2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

If she took her tests she would probably fail like most of the class does.

She is always confused and that makes the class confused. She basically just lectures so take notes and read from the book. everything you learn is in the textbook.

You have to show up to take notes (she refuses to post them on D2L). She will put you in a group at the beginning of the semester to do a bunch of assignments with. Gives extra credit to the \"group leader\" (who literally doesn't have to do anything). Definitely would take again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDIxNzkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

She is off her rocker a little bit, but I think anyone who teaches communication has to be out there. You show up, sign in, listen to a lecture, watch a video here and there, complete pages out of a workbook, and you will get your A. There is an assigned group project that is pretty easy. I highly recommend Holman!!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODk1OTY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1100","date_posted":"2016-08-14 12:40:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty easy class, just make sure you participate and listen to lectures.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODkyNzY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1100","date_posted":"2016-04-19 19:21:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"YOU MUST GO TO CLASS.
