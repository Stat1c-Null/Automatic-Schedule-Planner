Other than that, her lectures are interesting, she's extremely transparent, and if you talk with her one-on-one she's super nice and cool to talk to.  All exams are online & she does curve!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjQ4NTYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Takes attendance like all Comm professors. Forgets to post the quizzes online, & said she'd open them back up but didn't even do that when she said she would. If you're on your phone or talking, she'll stand there & look at you.

No technology what so ever. If she sees someone she will stop and call them out. She won't continue if people do not participate. Group work that is in class, but turned in online. Lots of online quizzes that you never know the due dates for. Study the online summaries for tests.

If you don't like your grades it's okay because you turn in the revised paper at the end and she will replace them.
