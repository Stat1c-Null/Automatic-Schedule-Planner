There is a lot of reading involved and the majority of the test material is from the reading, so make sure to read. Instead of a paper, he will give you a creative project which is pretty easy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NjkzNTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3324","date_posted":"2011-12-15 11:24:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Herndon is a great teacher! he will give serious lectures to the class to prepare everyone for the future and how we should prepare for the &quot;real world&quot; now. you should take notes in class on things he doesn't necessarily put on the powerpoint slides (he provides them online) &he explains what we need to know from the text. easy with EFFORT","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTIwOTky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2230","date_posted":"2011-11-06 11:07:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"TAKE HIM!!!!
