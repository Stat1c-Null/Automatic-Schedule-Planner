Tests were based on the textbook website which we were told not to buy. Did not learn what i thought i would. Very nice and understanding though.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzA0MzUy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM4129","date_posted":"2009-08-06 08:44:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Just like to add...she has no IDEA how to use WEB CT which I think should be a requirement for teachers and she DOES not respond to emails you send her.

Unfortunately I learned absolutely NOTHING. She was unprepared and filled time with class discussion on pretty much whatever. It was the most 3 excruciating hours of my life! And to top it ALL off, even though my 3 grades were well above an A average, she gave me a B for the class!I am infuriated with this teacher!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDk2NzQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM4429","date_posted":"2009-07-28 09:08:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dissapointing semester.  I think some days she hadn't even read the chapter before class. Always asking for discussion to fill up time. No syllabus until the second week (out of 8 weeks), and a presentation assignment worth 30% of the grade introduced two weeks later (which wasn't on the syllabus). Very disorganized. Don't take her!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDcwOTgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM4429","date_posted":"2009-07-27 21:51:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Granted this was the first time she taught this particular class, she really didn't seem confident in what she was teaching or doing. Let the students rule the class, and it got out of control. She needs to take the reigns and be more confident and i think she'd be a lot better. Interesting topic, but i felt like i really havent learned anything.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDcwMDY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1109","date_posted":"2009-06-02 14:20:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Regina Clarke is not a saint. She is an idiot. She doesn't have a clue how to teach, and she can't control the classroom. This is just another one of those stupid classes KSU requires you tot ake to graduate.

We watched movies, sat there watching her flail around answering students' questions, and learned absolutely NOTHING! She fell asleep during our oral presentation and ended up giving our group a 100% since she didn't know what to comment about. If you want to lose brain cells take her...","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODAxMjUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2201","date_posted":"2009-05-08 16:14:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Aright disregard everything said about this lady. She is a SAINT! Easy class with little notes. Fun to talk with and she is very god at what she does, She explains everything in thorough detail and seems to know everyone very quick.

Totally pointless class. She provides a random study guide before each test, but it is totally irrelevant.

All you do is watch movies and do work in the work book. You don't need to purchase the book unless you really want to study.
