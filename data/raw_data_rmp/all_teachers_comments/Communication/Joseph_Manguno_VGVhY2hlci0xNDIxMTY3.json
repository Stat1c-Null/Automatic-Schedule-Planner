He is very lecture heavy and attendance is mandatory, however he is very understanding to circumstances and is easily reached outside of class. He is prompt with emails. Sometimes his directions can be vague but he is ready to answer all questions as you need.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDk5NzE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JOUR3330","date_posted":"2019-04-10 14:41:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Went off the rails with his schedule so we never knew what was due or when. Doesn't explain much and expects you to know everything after the first time. His expectations go against what you learn in previous classes. Gives points back if you argue your case well. Every test is short answer and he gives the material a day before.

He has so much experience in the field, so he knows his stuff. However, if you're looking for an easy A, don't take him. He is very particular and edits your work like it would be in a newsroom.
