She's incredibly smart, insightful, down to earth, and always willing to help. Her class made me a more confident speaker. If you get the chance to take her, do it&#8212;you won't regret it!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTc4MjI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1100","date_posted":"2024-12-09 19:03:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor was really good. The 3rd party app that was used was Revel and its assignments and quizzes on there every week. and a choice board of discussion post, only 5 required in the semester. Overall amazing professor and she's very understanding and gives clear grading criteria. just pace yourself and don't miss deadlines. Test were easy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTc1ODQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1100","date_posted":"2024-12-09 00:25:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Two words. TAKE HER! I'm a 30+ student so took her class while working a corporate job and also having to travel a lot for work this semester - all assignments were very straight to the point. There were 3 exams. Had to complete 5/13 assignments- very easy stuff! No final, just an EOY project that was the easiest thing I've ever done.
