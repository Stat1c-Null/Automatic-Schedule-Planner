Course is not hard, it helps to read.  Book is available in e-version, through Kindle app, which is helpful.  I didn't use Launchpad, but it was available for quizzes to help study for tests.

You get an A if you get an 85% and above. If you don't go to class, you wont pass because attendance is a part of your grade. Tests are not that bad, word for word out of the book.

Tests are unclear, everyone fails the first one. Material is not adequately covered, reads lectures off of slides ALL class period, is very late on grading EVERYTHING, and is late to class every single day.
