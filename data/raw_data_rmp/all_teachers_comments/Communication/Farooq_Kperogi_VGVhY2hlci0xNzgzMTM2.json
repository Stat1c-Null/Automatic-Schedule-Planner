He is so helpful and makes every person feel important and intelligent; he listens intently to you and cares what you have to say. He makes everything easy and accessible; I had him for a 3000 class and it felt like a beginner course, and I learned a lot. I was so lucky to have him as a professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjI3NjIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1101","date_posted":"2014-06-24 21:16:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice person and tries to keep you interested.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMzk5NDMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2230","date_posted":"2014-06-09 10:37:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class as a Maymester and found it to be easy.

Such a sincere and wonderful soul. He genuinely wants you to do well and gives you all the resources necessary to do so. I did not buy the book but I still made an A. I just supplemented the material with online resources (i.e. Wiki \"History of Advertising\"). Everything you need to know is on the study guide.

KPEROGI'S MAYMESTER WAS THE BEST. made a 477/500 in the class. 5 pop quizzes, 4 exams (all curved), attendance/participation, and an easy extra credit. listen during class, take good notes, study your notes (i never looked at the study guides), READ (this is essential!) and you'll do great.
