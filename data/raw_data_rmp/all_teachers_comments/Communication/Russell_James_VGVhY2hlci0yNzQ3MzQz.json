He is unorganized and doesn't follow a schedule. He doesn't really try to make a connection with his students. He is very knowledgeable but is cocky and arrogant. He did not use follow-along tutorials to teach the Adobe programs, which I personally did not like.

He focuses far more on actual applicable skills in media production than giving useless quizzes or readings. I felt like I actually learned things that I can take away and use for many years after college. Also funny and very kind.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDAxOTY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
