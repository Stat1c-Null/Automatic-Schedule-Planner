I am not a great researcher by any means, and although I got a C, I could've gotten worse but she helps so much and is an easy grader. I owe her so much if I ever get to see her in person!

The whole class is based off discussion posts, a couple of quizzes , but throughout the semester you are writing your final paper . This class wasn't hard at all , but of course when you're writing a paper it is time consuming . I loved her . I would chose her again 100% .
