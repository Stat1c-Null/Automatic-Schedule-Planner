They are boring and everything is taken directly out the book. She does take attendance so you have to show up. She gives a moderate amount of work. 4 one page papers, 1 long paper and a presentation over the long paper topic. The good thing is she is an easy grader.

Assigns a research paper so we can learn to write one, but the required Research Methods class does that already.
