There are 4 assignments and 4 tests. Each test had a &quot;study guide&quot;. It was very boring but an easy A if you pay attention and study. He takes attendance for the most part.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDUxMDk0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--TEST HEAVY--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3375","date_posted":"2010-05-10 07:48:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice guy, but absolutely horrible at returning emails! So hopefully you won't have any questions during your classes. He's easy to listen to and fun to learn from, just does not communicate well.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTYxOTM4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3355","date_posted":"2009-01-14 09:56:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's funny and very knowledgeable. Lots of real-world experience, and gives students every opportunity to be successful. People that make C's in his classes are those that don't do the reading or come to class. His only fault is that he lets the frat crowd be really rowdy and act like high schoolers; they take advantage of his good nature.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzcxMjIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3335","date_posted":"2009-01-08 11:22:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"I don't agree with the first comment. Dr. Mayo DOES draw questions from both the book and the powerpoints. The tests are rediculus because nobody has time to know both the book and powerpoints' every little detail. He is very tricky.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzM5NzA2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3335","date_posted":"2008-05-09 12:31:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very inconsistant.  Test questions are tricky, and not because of material but because of the way he words them.  Very strict grader for papers, 20 pts off for grammar errors.

Sometimes very boring making it hard to concentrate.  Uses ppt presentations and tests are drawn directly from presentations.  A few short group papers to write that aren't hard.  One longer final group paper that ties all the short papers together.  Tests are T/F, Mult Choice & short answers.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNTE2MzM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
