She randomly adds more and more to the already jam-packed syllabus. She believes in doing to learn, yet doing doesn't always help if you don't understand what you are doing! She might be awesome during a regular semester but for a summer semester the workload is unrealistic.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Nzk3NTk4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3330","date_posted":"2009-08-26 10:08:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"NO","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MTUyMjI5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
