The course has a discussion due each week, one midterm and a final and an easy paper thrown in there too, no lockdown browser. Textbook is 'required' but you won't use it so don't bother. Great class!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDg0OTg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1200","date_posted":"2013-12-07 16:30:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is an enthusiastic teacher, and genuinely cares about her students. But, she isn't really clear about what she wants. She will curve the grade, if you do well, but if you suck at presentations, speaking in front of the class or are just lazy, you won't do very well. Test are pretty easy, straight from what she teaches.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDYzMTgx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1200","date_posted":"2013-12-05 23:16:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"great bright personality not monotoned at all. however she doesn't ever seem to be clear on what she wants. On top of that she is a tuff grader when she says she won't grade so hard.she expects you to participate in class (which i liked). the class is just a 1st year seminar for thrive i didn't want an easy A just not a super stressful class..","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDUwMjM1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
