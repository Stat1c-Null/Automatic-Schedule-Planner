HOWEVER she did change the wording of her tests after that. She should NOT run the class like she runs her team at CNN. She was publicly critical of people and the whole group leader thing was a joke. Talk to people directly!! Think carefully before taking her class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTQ0NjUz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1109","date_posted":"2010-05-06 18:04:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher was brand new and she clearly had no clue on how to teach entry level college students. Very rude to students. She gave group leaders way to much control over group. She gave them the power to take attendance and when she had issues with students or class she went to them. She is very sarcastic with students and insensitive.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTM5NjE0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1109","date_posted":"2010-05-06 18:01:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a very hard teacher. She was brand new and it really did show. She gave group leaders way to much control over group members, by letting them take attendance, and went through them with issues that she had with the student. She was unresponsive with emails. First test was way to hard and most of the class failed it. Don't recommend her!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTM5NTky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1109","date_posted":"2010-05-01 22:18:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"She needs a filter. She was MEAN in e-mails and in class. Her tests are awful. Multiple choice- 3 normal answers, 1 all of the above and 1 none of the above from the book if you memorized it.Attendance mandatory or she calls you out by name and tells others to tell you to see her, so she can tell you to drop her class. I did attend.

She is unwilling to help studnets, when students share a concern she brushes them off. Makes you feel less than a person in her class. Cancels class and then emails group leaders 20 minutes after class time. She has a horrible attitude.

Shes not very helpful when it comes to getting grades up, grades very strictly when it comes to group project. She is a producer at CNN and she should keep her day job because effective teaching is not her skill.
