He cares on a human level not just &quot;student&quot;. His lectures are fun and forces you out of your comfort zone. The lowest grade I got- my fault. He is so understanding and helpful!!

The class was very entertaining. I would definitely knock the paper out asap and get that finish. Everything else is smooth sailing. There are a few Quizlets of the test for studying purposes. I would also advise a Groupme therefore everyone is pushing together. This class will challenge your thinking and patience.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTE2ODA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ORGC3376","date_posted":"2019-05-07 14:27:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Jinks is amazing and one of KSU's best professors! However, the class can be kind of boring. There are so many group presentations/project presentation and after every presentation, the class usually rambles for a half hour about their opinions and I'm just sitting there like who cares, shut up.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzk1NjQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ORGC3459","date_posted":"2018-02-26 12:19:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Jinks is awesome. He gives great feedback on your papers, and as long as you try, he will give you the grades. His lectures are actually fun and every week we learned something new through in-class scenario presentations. Just do the assignments he asks you to do and know well of the APA format. You will be fine!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NTk3MzQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM3459","date_posted":"2017-05-09 23:30:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Jinks was awesome!
