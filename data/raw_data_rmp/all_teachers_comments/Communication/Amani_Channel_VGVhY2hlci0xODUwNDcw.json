He doesn't give any tests. He gives pop quizes for participation credit. 4 assignments. Never touched the book. Just pay attention to the lectures (It'll help you when you go to film) He always let class out early. The only thing that sucked was that he never posts your grades.

I enjoyed him at UWG when he was there. A LOT of reading but the study guides were very helpful on his tests. He honestly has a great personality and is very nice; but the unorganization really bothered me.  He's chill, but he doesn't need to teach.

I feel as if I spoke too hastily, because he wasn't as tough a grader as it seemed he was being; I ended up getting an A. So while he could keep students more in the loop about grades, he's not a tough grader and I can't argue with getting a good grade. And he's a cool guy, so I do recommend him after all.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjE0MTcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"DIGITALMEDIA","date_posted":"2014-11-08 13:44:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Laid back, but takes video seriously. He grades hard. He said, quote, \"I'm going to grade hard.\" Introductory video class, he gave students 70s on their solid projects. Huh?  Doesn't post grades up.  On the plus side, he's very knowledgable and clearly has years of experience with video. But I can't recommend a hard grader for an intro class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzcwMjI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2254","date_posted":"2014-10-29 13:23:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Channel is approachable, funny, and he really knows his stuff. He has a vast background in media and he applies that to everything that he teaches. His exams are straight from the textbook and the lectures follow along with book and slideshow that he posts online. He's a really nice and laid back guy. I would definitely recommend him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzEwOTU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM3340","date_posted":"2014-07-26 16:23:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this class!!!
