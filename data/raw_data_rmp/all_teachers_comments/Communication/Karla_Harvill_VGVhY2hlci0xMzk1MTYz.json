You have one major presentation (solo) and several small homework assignments. I didn't buy the book and I got an A. The powerpoints (which she uploads to D2L) tell you all you need to know.

I repeat, do NOT buy the textbook. I didn't and made A's on all the tests. She puts so much info on her powerpoints (and reads them word for word during her lectures) that there is no use in wasting your money. She is super unorganized and unclear about everything, but it was an easy A so I can't complain too much.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODMwNTQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3429","date_posted":"2012-11-08 14:49:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Harvill loves her job at Wellstar, so be prepared to hear about it almost every class.  She is very high strung, and loves to talk so the class feels like it goes on forever.  Her class is interesting and the projects are time consuming but really interesting since you get to pick your own topics.  All test material comes from Powerpoints","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODAwMzY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3429","date_posted":"2012-06-08 16:13:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"She wasn't flexible, understanding, clear, or exciting. Read word for word off of the ppts. Made a potentially interesting class a total bore. Gave attendance grades at random, so make sure you're on her good side. If you do the projects (easy), study the wordy ppts for the test, and talk to her/participate you'll be ok.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzk0NDA1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM4429","date_posted":"2010-01-13 21:47:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am taking her for Interpersonal Communications. She seems pretty cool, a little cooky but for the most part pretty helpful. I've only had one class with her so far but I can tell she enjoys telling stories. Her class seems like it'll be pretty demanding but if you do the work, pretty easy for the most part. I'll rate again @ end of the semester.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzI0NDI5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
