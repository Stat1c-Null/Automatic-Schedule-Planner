She's really sweet and can be a little repetitive.  No laptops or cell phones in class. An easy A if you go to class and give your speeches on time. If you don't make at least a B in this class you didn't put forth an effort...its just that easy.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDA1NTk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2129","date_posted":"2012-03-28 15:57:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class was fairly easy. She gave reviews for the mid-term and final, which were word-for-word on the test. At times her lecture became repetitive, but other than that I feel like I learned a lot from her, and became a better speaker.

She was a little confusing at first, but give her a chance and dont drop her.  She is funny and extremely helpful if you are confused, and very flexible on changing due dates to make the class happy.
