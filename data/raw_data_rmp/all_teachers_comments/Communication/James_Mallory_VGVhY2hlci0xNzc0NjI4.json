Enjoyed the class, he is challenging and yes his assignments are difficult, but they are worth it. Trust me if you're looking for someone with serious industry knowledge about media management. Take this dude.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTQ1MDAz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2135","date_posted":"2013-05-13 12:45:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Don't take this class if you're not up for a challenge. Professor Mallory challenged me and made me a better writer. He is a perfectionist, but with this career field, it gets you ready for a real job in the industry! He has a lot of experience with being Senior Editor at AJC. Take advantage of using him as a reference. Good in my book!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzQ2NDg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM4430","date_posted":"2012-12-13 00:09:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Don't take unless you absolutely have to or if you are great at teaching yourself. Most questions are trivial (better look up when Facebook was started) and essay questions are difficult if you don't have a grasp understanding of the topics. Textbook use is limited for actual learning in class, but you WILL need it to even make a C on the exam.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDQ4NzQ2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM4430","date_posted":"2012-12-07 08:32:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Terrible professor. He jingles the change in his pocket every class and lectures for an hour and fifteen minutes straight. Very dry and boring, also unprepared to teach! His tests are awful, the material he asks you to learn is too vague and his tests are a mixture of short answer and essay format. Harsh paper grader as well!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTgwMTEx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM4430","date_posted":"2012-12-03 17:57:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!  The only highlight to this class was that he had guest speakers come in and teach every once in awhile. His exams are RIDICULOUS. The questions do not pertain to the chapters and the questions he asks make the test a guessing game. Do not take this class unless you are prepared to teach yourself.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTM5NTE0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
