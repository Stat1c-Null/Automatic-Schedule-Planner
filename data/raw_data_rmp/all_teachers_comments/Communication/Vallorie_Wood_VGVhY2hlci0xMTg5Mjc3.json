Group participation is mandatory. You learn alot about news. Know your current events for pop quizes. Overall very sweet lady. Received an A. Tests aren't straightforward but not hard. Would take her again. Highly recommended.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTE3OTI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM3340","date_posted":"2012-12-31 21:34:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy if you show up for class and submit everything.

Don't be intimidated by final cut pro,the more you use it the easier it gets.  Take notes while she is teaching that part of the class.  She goes fast. Three tests, the final is cumulative.  The projects are good, better if you have a good group, but you do switch every project so don't worry.  Dress warm.

A cross between film appreciation and public speaking with some interpersonal communications concepts sprinkled in.
