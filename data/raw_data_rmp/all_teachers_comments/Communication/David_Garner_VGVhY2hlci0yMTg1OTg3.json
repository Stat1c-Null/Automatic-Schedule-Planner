After being in his class I feel so much better about public speaking. He makes the class super fun and interesting. Lectures are never too long, speeches are graded fairly and outside work is minimum. He genuinely cares about each of his students and their success in the class. Would definitely recommend him to anyone.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTI3NjQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
