While she does make you read, they are articles that are specific to what we are learning. She doesn't use a book but there are notes. She adds short videos and small exercises to keep our class engaged.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2Nzk4Njgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
