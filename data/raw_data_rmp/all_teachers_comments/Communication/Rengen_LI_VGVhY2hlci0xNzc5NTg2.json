Sometimes he might be difficult to understand, but he's always open to questions and if you ask him to explain something or go deeper into a topic, he will be more than happy to. He does grade a bit harder, but that's because we're in college, not grade school. Quality work expected.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTM3MzI3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM332503","date_posted":"2013-04-10 20:29:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Midterm, final, essay, group project and pop quizzes ALL THE TIME.  Not only is this class incredibly boring, the material is very difficult, and the professor speaks very broken english. Most of the time I don't even know what he's saying. Save yourself if you can!!!!!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTE1NjI3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM332503","date_posted":"2013-04-10 19:21:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the worst class ever do not take it. He puts questions on test that have more than one right answer. Then tells the class he was only looking for one. He does not give good presentations and is just terrible at communicating. Seems like a nice guy but does not need to teach college courses.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTE1MTg0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM3325","date_posted":"2013-03-21 09:16:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst prof I've had at KSU. Did well in the class because I got a pretty good grade on the paper.  He is difficult to understand, boring, the test questions make no sense, and you stay in class until the very last minute. Would wait a semester if he's your only choice.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDMyNjQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3325","date_posted":"2012-12-12 01:30:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Be prepared to read an entire chapter before every class. This is by far the worst professor I have ever had and I didn't even fail the class. But I learned absolutely nothing. All I can say is for someone teaching INTERCULTURAL comm, he should learn how to interact with Americans because he is RUDE! Oh, and I couldn't understand a word he said.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDMyOTQy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3325","date_posted":"2012-12-11 12:55:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Genuinely unexciting, & quizzes aren't part of the grade. Syllabus said there'd be 10, by Nov there had been 1. Three by the end. Difficult to understand, nearly impossible to please. Unclear credentials for the course(?) Seems like someone who read the book & decided he could teach. Group projects started HARSH, ended up nice?
