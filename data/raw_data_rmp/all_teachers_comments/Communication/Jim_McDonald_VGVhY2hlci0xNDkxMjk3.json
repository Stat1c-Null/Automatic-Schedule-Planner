He is a super cool professor and has been in the business so he knows what he is talking about. No electronics w/o prior permission, and he often goes over the same powerpoint for a class or two in a row, but who cares he is the best take him!! Everything is online and tests are easy.

All of the information you need to know for the tests was on his powerpoints, and he does post them online. Homework was simple and to the point.
