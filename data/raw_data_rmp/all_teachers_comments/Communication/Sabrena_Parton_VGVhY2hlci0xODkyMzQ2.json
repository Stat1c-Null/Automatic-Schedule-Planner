Midterm/Final count HEAVILY. The good news is that you won't bomb either if you do everything in the modules. She's ok. It was an online course and aside from her enthusiastic posts on what's due that week, didn't really hear from her. She drops a lot of stuff at the end which is nice.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjM1NDAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1100","date_posted":"2020-07-30 01:24:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was very nice and explained everything very well. The textbook was mandatory because it had an online portal where she assigned the homework. Homework is very easy. Your grade is based on a few tests, homework and periodically a few extra credit opportunities.

Spends most of class time blabbering about her life and does not teach actual information in which we need to do well on tests. If you take her, be prepared to learn everything from the textbook.

Her lectures are interesting but you never feel like they prepare you for the tests. There are 4 tests, one being the final, all pretty difficult. If you miss more than three classes your grade suffers. Overall, she makes the class way harder than it needs to be.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzYzMTc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Hilarious--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COM1109","date_posted":"2015-05-13 21:54:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Parton is a great professor who is very passionate about communications and human behaviors.

Test are hard, but all online in class. She makes you do one presentation in front of the class with a group which has nothing to do with the class. You don't have to know any of the presentations for the test. She makes you buy the textbook and workbook but only use workbook 3x.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTI2MzM0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1109","date_posted":"2015-01-14 21:32:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a very sweet teacher, and the class is pretty fun, but I cant tell you how many times ive sent an email with no reply,and still to this point no reply.

She's nice, compassionate towards her job, and she always walks in with a smile on her face no matter how bad her morning was. Her lectures are fairly long, but she makes jokes and gets laughs.

She is really funny, and always talks about her kids and husband, but they're great stories. Also talks about her life a lot. For an 8 AM class, she kept me very awake. Study the PowerPoints she puts online when a test is coming up. If you do that, you should have no problem passing the class. Tough grader on the individual project.

She often tells personable stories to help students grasp concepts. Tests can be tough, but if you go over her power points a few times the night before a test you shouldn't make less than a B. One major speech assignment which is 20% of your grade, she grades more harshly than expected, most people get high B's.

Very interesting and funny, although she mentions her religious views often which probably bothers some people. Not great with technology, but it's entertaining. Posts powerpoints from class and study guides for tests. Tests are kinda tough.. even when you cheat. Barely used the textbook.
