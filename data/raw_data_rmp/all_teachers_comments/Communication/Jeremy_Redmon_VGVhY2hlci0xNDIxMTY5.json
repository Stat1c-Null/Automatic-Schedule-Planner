He genuinely cares about his students and runs the class in such a way that is respectful to your personal time and duties. Most grades require a medium effort (reading responses), then he has gimme quiz grades, and a few larger assignments which he talks you through.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzg5NTkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"JOUR4300","date_posted":"2020-10-14 17:11:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Redmon is amazing. He is so kind, professional, and understanding. He always reviews the previous class before getting started on that day's content, which is nice. He has tons of awesome guest speakers, starts lots of good class conversations, and is truly a good person. Best professor I've ever had. Can't recommend him enough.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzAwODU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Lots of homework","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM4420","date_posted":"2012-11-05 16:45:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Redmon is the greatest professor ever! He works for the AJC so he has first hand experience with writing feature stories. He uses all of his class time for teaching and in class assignments, but you will not be bored because he is a funny guy. He has a lot of professional contacts and frequently invites guest speakers.

Very nice man and is very helpful. Class is challenging and the final project is 40% of your final grade so you have to really work at it. Very fast in responding to questions via email. Overall class is challenging, but he knows his stuff and you will learn a lot of new interesting things.

However, he has a hard time teaching some ap style and writing techniques for an investigative reportand grades way too difficult on the final project that is 50% of the grade.

I LOVE this class. It's a class that you can clearly identify the skills you learned that will be applicable in your career. Yes, it's a really challenging course, but interesting and he's really fun and VERY helpful. Responds to e-mails diligently. You can tell he really cares.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTAxNTQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
