Then, she gives gives harsh grades and takes points off for the most minor details. Mainly because she does not address any confusion or unclear criteria. She's out of touch with students and doesn't communicate well for someone who teaches communications.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDA5MDI2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MENT4434","date_posted":"2025-04-16 02:31:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"I did not like her personality, class, and style of teaching at all.

She is lazy, has random assignments missing, and incorrect answers on quizzes/tests. I had to email her at least once a week for the first four weeks of class because of this.
