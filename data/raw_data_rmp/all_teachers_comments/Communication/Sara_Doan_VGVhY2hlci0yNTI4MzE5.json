This was the first time I had reached out. She gives misleading feedback on drafts (\"Great Work\" when she didn't even look at it). Tough grader for final draft.

Super nice and super helpful - in and outside of the classroom. She genuinly wants her students to understand the course information and goes above and beyond to make sure her students pass.

Not only is she funny, shes so sweet. She gives amazing feedback, and is a fair grader. She wont hand you an A+, but shell give you the grade you deserve, and explain why any points were taken off.

She makes the topic interesting and is hilarious in class. She lets students speak their mind on topics. Most of your grade is based on weekly quizzes on book chapters, very few tests, and two projects. There's one group project, but its a small one.
