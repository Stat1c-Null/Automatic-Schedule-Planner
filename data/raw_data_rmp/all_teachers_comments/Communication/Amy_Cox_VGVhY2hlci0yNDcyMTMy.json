Come in this class with a open mind and creativity, because you're going to have to create you own news stories and conduct interviews.

Cox made the course very interesting and SUCH a light load, so if you're someone who has jobs and other life stuff, take her! Quizzes are EASY. You do need a textbook & AP book for assignments, but the chapters are short. If she's teaching anything else I'm picking her immediately.

The class was well organized and the assignments weren't overwhelming. For me, the AP style was the hardest part, the writing was easy. There is an SI group, too.
