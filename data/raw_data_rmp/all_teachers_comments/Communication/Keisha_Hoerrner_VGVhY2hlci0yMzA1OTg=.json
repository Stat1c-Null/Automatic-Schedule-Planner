It made things easier to understand and learn because she knows what she's talking about. I went into this class thinking it would be dumb and easy, it was neither dumb or easy, but only because I didn't do the readings. Do the readings she assigns and watch the videos!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Njk0NTU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU2290","date_posted":"2009-11-04 20:36:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is class is hard.

She is extremely funny and helpful. You can tell she really cares about her students. Her tests are tricky, just go over your notes and review the readings you were supposed to have read.

It's not the joke that 1101 is, at least. Dr. Hoerrner has put in some things like the Millinium Development Goals that really make the class a lot more about activism than communication. I expected a lot more about written communication since I want to be a writer, but at least the class wasn't comepletely boring.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTUwMjg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1101","date_posted":"2007-06-15 15:33:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"I thought she was totally hot.

Her class was very hard.  The one thing I remember is her locking the door when class started.  As a &quot;working student&quot; I couldn't always get to class on time.
