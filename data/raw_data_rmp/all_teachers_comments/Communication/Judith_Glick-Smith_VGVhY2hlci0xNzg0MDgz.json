Tests are online and SO easy. All papers are 1-3 pages long. Assignments are short and she's an easy grader.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjEyNTA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3435","date_posted":"2013-04-01 23:18:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"I absolutely loved her and couldn't have asked for a better professor. She takes everything from the book. Tests are online and come straight from the book. She breaks the rules and doesn't do things the way the school wants her to do things. She highly emphasizes that she wants you to think for yourself and not memorize everything.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDczMTg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
