She was extremely distracted when I took her class.. she forgot the keys to the audio booths on the only class day we had to do a project(3 groups, 1 booth in the lab?!). As a class, we went to the Com. Dept. office to get keys. WHY COULDN'T SHE DO THAT!? Unclear grading, unclear expectations, seems disinterested in teaching. tests were ok.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMzkxMDQ5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3340","date_posted":"2012-03-29 09:33:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Bradley gets a bad rap because her class is hard. Most of the students who don't like her don't pay attention in her class. You CANNOT just pick up production. She teaches you how to do it. You HAVE to listen. No one else seems to get that. She answers emails quickly and her tests are easy if you study the study guides.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTY3NDQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM4425","date_posted":"2011-11-29 14:23:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"So unprofessional and quite rude.

She requires readings but never discusses them, blames all the racism and problems in the world on straight white men, wants you to take your issues with assignments to another professor, and you basically have to teach yourself.

She has no passion for teaching. She expects you to teach yourself and if any mistakes happen don't expect her to help you out. She blames the students for everything and nothing is ever her fault.
