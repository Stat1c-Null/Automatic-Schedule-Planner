She was thrown into teacher a class only a few weeks before the semester started but she handled it perfectly! It is a lot of work but she's very lenient with grades. Most of the time she gives you an extra week to complete an assignment past the due date. I would def. retake this prof in a heartbeat!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDYwNTUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
