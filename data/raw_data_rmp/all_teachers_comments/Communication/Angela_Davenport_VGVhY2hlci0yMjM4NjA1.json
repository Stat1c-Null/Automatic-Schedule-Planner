Dont asks question, she will tell you to refer to the book because she doesnt know herself. Class was easy if you just followed the book exactly! Boring class but youll pass.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjcxNzMx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Tests are tough--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COM2129","date_posted":"2017-05-02 01:34:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Davenport is a great Public Speaking teacher! She really wants you to succeed and as long as you follow the instructions in the workbook then you'll do fine on your speeches. Cares about her students and has a relaxed teaching environment!

All you do is write speeches, which she CLAIMS she grades super heavily, but she doesn't. I've made A+'s on every single assignment. This is a super easy class, she just sucks at public speaking, herself. She's kind, though. Don't buy the textbook, just the workbook.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTMzMDc5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Clear grading criteria--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COM2129","date_posted":"2017-03-31 14:53:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you can take someone else, do. Davenport is a little rude, and she does not exercise the topics of effective public speaking that she teaches. She is very monotone and does not seem very invested in the class. We had a 22 point curve on the midterm because she hadn't taught us some of the chapters.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTc2MTUy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

She claims to be a tough grader - on the first day of class claimed the average was a C. However after completing this class, that cant be true.
