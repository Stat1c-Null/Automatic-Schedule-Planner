We also watched two movies and took two tests (which I guessed on and made A's). That is the entire class; there didn't seem to be a whole lot of purpose to it, and the prof's lack of engagement seems to reflect this.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njk3MzUz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--EXTRA CREDIT--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COM1100","date_posted":"2017-01-06 11:17:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful teacher.

Professor Dean is my favorite. She really knows her information and includes a lot of personal experiences in her lectures. Class is easy if you attend because of in class work.
