She is very demanding and assigns possibly too much work, but she takes a lot of time to provide detailed feedback on all assignments. Even when she loves what you've done, she'll provide constructive criticism to make it better. This is my second class with her, and I would gladly study with her again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExOTc1OTIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMMDESIGN","date_posted":"2005-11-22 08:34:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Does not give good instructions or offers positive critiques on assignments.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEwOTY4MzUy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM","date_posted":"2005-05-31 11:46:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I despise this lady with a passion!
