He gives phenomenal real-world examples that can relate to anybody. His \"romance novel\" assignment was simple yet gave his students a way to apply the material to their life.

You must pay attention in class and take notes to do well on the papers, but I would highly recommend him to anyone. Don't buy the text, you won't need it.

Teaching style is more relatable to students, letting us pick tv shows/music and then relate it to a theory. All exams are essay style. One group presentation based off a tv show of your choice.
