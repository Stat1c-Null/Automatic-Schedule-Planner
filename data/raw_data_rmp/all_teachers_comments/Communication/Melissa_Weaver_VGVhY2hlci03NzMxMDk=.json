Tests come out of the book - not the notes.  Students teach most of the class which can be a little confusing at times.  Overall, she does give plenty of chances for extra credit and seems to understand the restraints of students working full-time and going to school.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNzM4Njc3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMMUNICATION","date_posted":"2006-04-04 18:51:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is an awesome professor.
