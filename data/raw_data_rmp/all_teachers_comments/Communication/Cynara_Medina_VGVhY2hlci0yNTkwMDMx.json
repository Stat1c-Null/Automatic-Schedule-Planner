Her feedback is not clear, and shes a tough grader if you dont do the paper to her exact standards. Everything she taught was to write one paper, so I learned almost nothing.

Not a bad course load but you will work a little. Usual discussion every week and small assignment between that builds towards writing your final paper. She made me rewrite my body 3 times. Got a 95 on the final. Ended the class with an 88.95 Recommend taking her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODI1NjY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2020","date_posted":"2021-05-13 15:25:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Medina is a tough grader, but she gives such thorough feedback that it is impossible to receive anything less than an A in the class. Discussions every week, 5 quizzes total, and you write the different parts of the final paper throughout the year and piece it all together to form your final paper at the end. Solid choice.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Nzg0MjQ3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2020","date_posted":"2021-03-30 23:09:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class is awful and the things we do just lead up to one big paper.

This is an intro, basic, 2000 level class and this woman grades it like it's a senior seminar. Very poor feedback for all assignments. Her content is boring. I have upper level, 3000 classes, for communications and PR and they aren't nearly as meticulous or hard as this class.

She is one of the toughest graders Ive ever had, and her feedback doesnt help at all. I ended the class with an 89.9, and she gave me a B.

There is a discussion post every week that is not easy but not horrible. The only grades are the discussion posts and the paper you spend the whole semester writing. The paper counts for a lot more than the discussion posts so if you don't do well on the paper you are screwed.
