Honestly, if you get less than an A in this class you're doing it wrong. He goes over the test the day prior to the tests and gives the answers. DO NOT buy the textbook for this class!!

He's very sweet & funny. But he's just teaching so he has a soapbox to stand on. He requires attendance but shouldn't bc all he does is tell jokes & give opinions. No real teaching.
