Seems to be knowledgeable on photojournalism but it's obvious she's a new teacher. Not very clear with her feedback. You have to ask questions cause she won't give you the information herself. Assignments aren't hard you just have to know what she's looking for. Tests all from book. Didn't learn a lot.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDIwMjAy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM3360","date_posted":"2013-11-25 00:13:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Cait Baron's ability to teach is poor. She requires attendance (2 unexcused absences before she removes a letter grade from you final grade). She basically tells you what to do, but doesn't show you how and she expects you to be a master at Adobe Premier, Indesign and photoshop. She also will not help if you have questions.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzgyNDE0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
