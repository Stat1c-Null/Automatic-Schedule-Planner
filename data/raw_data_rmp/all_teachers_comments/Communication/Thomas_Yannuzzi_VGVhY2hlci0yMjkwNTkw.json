This is an upper level course, and students aren't used to not having everything handed to them. If you like going through the motions in college and not learning actual lessons that will be useful after graduation, you won't like his course.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTE0ODUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Amazing lectures--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ORGC3345","date_posted":"2018-02-28 15:26:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"I honestly believe this man goes out of his way to make your life harder than it already is. He treats it as an audit class when we are already in an audit class that actually matters to us. Team communication made me cry on multiple occasions. His grading is ridiculous.

The content is not hard, but the tests and assignments are. Two test, paper, and group presentation. He does not post grades so you won't know what you have until final grades. He is a nice guy, but he takes this class VERY seriously. I would suggest not buying the book, everything you need is in the PowerPoints.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjU1OTQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Tests are tough","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COMM3345","date_posted":"2017-12-18 11:02:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's caring, if he sees students trying. Horrible with grading assignments on time. Exams are tough, because he switches the testing method without notice. First exam, multiple choice with essay questions.

Yannuzzi is very nice, but he makes this class more difficult than it needs to be. His tests and quizzes are very tough and he gives no guidelines for the paper and presentation.

You have to be prepared to UNDERSTAND the materials. You CANNOT get a good grade in his class by memorization. It is about understanding and applying to what he asks in the tests. He wants you to &quot;learn&quot; and not care so much about grades so if that is the kind of teacher you want, then go for him. Many found his class HARD.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDM1NDc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--GROUP PROJECTS--Tests are tough","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"COM3345","date_posted":"2017-11-29 10:35:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a nice guy, but he makes this class is very difficult. The topic is easy and interesting, but his exams are a monster.

The tests are tough and he gives no study guides or review. Read the chapters and study the Power Points to pass. The group project is the most challenging part.
