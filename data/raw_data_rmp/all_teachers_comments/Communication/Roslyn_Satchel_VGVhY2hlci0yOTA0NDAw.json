Grades were arbitrary, she taught online class from the YMCA a couple times, doesn't understand how to use D2L (to our detriment), and was incredibly patronizing/demeaning to students.

This is the worst professor I have had  at Kennesaw. She spends most of class time listing off her achievements and moral standings, instead of teaching any course material. There are basically four grades all semester, none have rubrics.

I have had a lot of great professors at KSU but Satchel is not one of them. She does not communicate, doesn't know to properly use D2L, based the entire course solely on her text book and is disrespectful when you don't agree with her.
