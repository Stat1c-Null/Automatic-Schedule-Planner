As someone who is extremely shy, his class helped me so much and I was able to pass with an easy A. You get to pick what your topic is as long as it's within the speech criteria and if you help with the timer or video, you get extra credit. Show up to class though, especially speech days!

I hate public speaking, but he makes it actually enjoyable. He genuinely cares for his students and is there for you if you need him. I would take him for every class if I could. Attendance is pretty much mandatory especially on speech days as there is a participation grade. Definitely take him!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTQxOTM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
