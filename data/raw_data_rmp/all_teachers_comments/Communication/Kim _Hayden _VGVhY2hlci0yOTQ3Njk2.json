You have work due every Sunday but it's very easy, a quiz on Revel and your choice of 5/13 assignments for the semester. Not a tough grader at all, I got 100s on everything. Highly recommend!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTY4MTYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ORGC3376","date_posted":"2023-11-10 07:28:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Professor Hayden for my Interpersonal Communications class. She's alright, but she could be passive-aggressive at times and isn't the best communicator. The quizzes are very short, so getting two questions wrong will give you a bad grade. You automatically get a zero on an assignment if you don't turn it in before the due date. Super strict.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzcxMDIz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
