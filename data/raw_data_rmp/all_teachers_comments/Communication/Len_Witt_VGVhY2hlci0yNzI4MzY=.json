I agree that he seems to grade on favoritism or whether he likes you or not. I worked hard, so I believe I deserved my A, but I could tell he favored me, too, which annoyed me. He could also be passive-aggressive and unnecessarily critical/harsh when going over people's stories, & is a bit avoidant, doesn't respond to emails.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTAxNDc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM4440","date_posted":"2005-08-31 08:22:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Laid Back and works with you.
