He was so nice and genuine and reopened all of the homeworks and quizzes I needed him to. He left mid-semester for some reason we were not told. He cancels most classes so if you do not want to show up for class he is the professor for you. He is definitely reachable by email and wants you to succeed!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjM4MjIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1100","date_posted":"2019-12-19 18:47:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved Dr. Thomas class. It was a lot of fun and he made a class that could be boring very interesting... now with that being said, he missed class A LOT... like 20/44 times. So, I don't know if that happens often or not. 4 exams, homework grade and participation. Really enjoyed him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzIwMzQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1100","date_posted":"2019-12-19 16:29:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Thomas is a great professor, but his lectures are very boring. Our class was at 8:00am so he cancelled class more than he showed up, which I'm fine with. Because of that, he gave us two take home tests. He's a cool guy and doesn't mind going off track to talk about important stuff or his personal life. Overall, I would say to take him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzE4ODA3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1100","date_posted":"2019-12-19 15:29:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"He missed class a lot, sometimes without notice. But he will curve at the end and offers extra credit, you get 5 points on random days just because you came to class!

He was kind and fun to listen to. However, he did miss class quite frequently; sometimes with no notice. He seemed to have a lot going on in his personal life. Although I completely understand that everyone has something going on in their lives, it got to the point where it had been at least 4 weeks without class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDcwNjYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM1100","date_posted":"2019-10-30 21:37:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a great professor. I didnt use my text book at all really just took the quizzes and did really well. I didnt study much and made an A. He uses a QR code for attendance so you might want to go. He cares about his class and gives very good examples to help it make sense to modern day time. I would take this class again for sure, just not 8 am.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzM4MzE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2129","date_posted":"2019-05-24 16:57:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was very chill. He is not a hard grader, and he focuses more on how your public speaking develops over the speeches. Do the study guide for the tests; you can use the lecture notes he posts online. Dr. Charles is very relaxed and makes you feel comfortable. He is very kind and understanding to his students and accessible outside of class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTQ4NTcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2129","date_posted":"2019-04-22 13:49:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing professor.

The class is supposed to be 3hrs long but we usually finish fast. He made this course a breeze. Tests were easy (do the study guide).
