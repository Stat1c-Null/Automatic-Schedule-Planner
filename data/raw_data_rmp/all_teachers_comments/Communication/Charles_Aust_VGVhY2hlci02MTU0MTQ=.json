I had it fridays with 2 instructors. It was easy and the tests were very easy as well. THe projects are very easy.

His grading methods are very hit-or-miss.  If you don't do exactly what he wants/expects (even on the opinion papers), he'll bomb them in red ink.

The multiple choice, matching and true/false aren't bad, it's just a lot to remember. The fill in the blanks is a different story. They're tough. A lot of test questions come from the study guide, but make sure you read through the chapters at least twice.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTcwMDgy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM3324","date_posted":"2005-10-26 10:40:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Too much outside work!!!You can barely get his stuff finished.
