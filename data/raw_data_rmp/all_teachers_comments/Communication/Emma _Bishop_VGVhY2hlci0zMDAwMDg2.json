This course has a group project that lasted ~1 month, but I had a great experience in my group. There are discussion posts based on the textbook (other than that you don't really need to read it) and I think 2 major quizzes that are lockdown, however the study guide is extremely helpful.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzc1MzMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4460","date_posted":"2025-04-12 14:19:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took professor Bishop for Crisis Comm (PR 4460) online. The class was easy, she gives great feedback and clear instructions and wants you to succeed. Her exams do use lockdown browser, but she gives study guides and there are only 2 exams, so it isn't too bad. I definitely recommend professor Bishop for this course!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTI1Mjk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
