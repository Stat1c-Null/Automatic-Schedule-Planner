She changed directions from the class to private emails and had no interest in free thinking or using the Adobe Creative Suite which is imperative for a Graphic Design Instructor.  She was also extremely sarcastic and talked to college students like they were in 3rd grade.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjI0MjE0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1010","date_posted":"2012-12-30 10:54:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great class, very easy, all you have to do is read and discuss the concepts in papers, the text was easy to understand, plus the instructor provided a lecture and written breakdown for every chapter.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTg1OTA3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1010","date_posted":"2012-12-30 10:17:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Instructor:  Did a great job with difficult, disrespectful students.

She has done a lot in the communications world and will tell you about it, but she has not idea how to teach a class.  Very confrontational, will argue about the simplest things.
