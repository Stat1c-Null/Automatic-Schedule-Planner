She makes the class really fun. 3 Journal assignments, weekly Discussion posts (easy), 6 quizzes (easy but need book), and 1 Corporate Image assignment (very easy). Get the book, you'll need it.

This is the best teacher at KSU, hands down. Teresa is WONDERFUL. You WILL get an A in this class,  I promise. The assignments are time consuming, but very easy. The final is made to help you and it's over a movie we watch in class. No tests, just quizzes. I wish I could take her over and over again.

There are 6 papers in this class, but they're easy as long as you space them out. NO tests, only a few quizzes, which are easy if you go to class! Dudenhoeffer is so friendly and approachable, and wants to make sure everyone succeeds. Easy A if you do the work and turn it in on time.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzE1NDMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--SO MANY PAPERS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2033","date_posted":"2016-11-08 10:34:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Seriously TAKE HER!

She doesn't ask for much except for students to pay attention. She dislikes when students don't participate and are too busy on their electronics. Her homework are easy if you pace yourself.

Many writing assignments, they're easy but time-consuming. The key is to *Do Them at a Steady Pace* (aka NOT at the last minute), and *Follow Their Simple Grading Criteria in the Syllabus*. Easy.

A bit quirky. Truly cares about students succeeding, is truly disappointed when students don't participate, just because she respects you and knows you can do well.
