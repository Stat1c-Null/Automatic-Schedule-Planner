At first, I was nervous because this class is a lot of work, and you really have to work for your grade. However, she is very helpful and always willing to help and make sure that you understand. Whenever we would write she would walk around and check on us. You have to work hard, but I promise she's worth it!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzY3MjQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PR3429","date_posted":"2016-10-18 10:02:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is my favorite class this semester! Very interesting material. Class is just a big group discussion based off of the persuasion theories. Do NOT study for tests solely based off of the in-class lectures. Read the powerpoints & the chapter summaries (she provides them), and you'll do well. I haven't touched the book, and I have an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDQ4NjI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2135","date_posted":"2016-07-27 11:09:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take her.. she talks a ton! But she's overall worth taking. Her AP assignments are tough.. You definitely need the A/P Style book or you wont pass. She is a tough grader, almost impossible to get a an A. However, I wouldn't have passe the grammar test without her. She gives a ton of practice test so you can see what the actual test is like.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODM3MTQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2135","date_posted":"2014-11-05 18:44:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor! You will work for your A or B or C and learn a lot from her. The class is interesting. Be ready for working with partnersgroup any moment. Do your assignments ON TIME! Actually do the practice work and BUY THE AP STYLE & TEXTBOOK ASAP! You WON'T pass wo it. Her lectures are straightforward & from the book.

Her lectures aren't bad, and her assignments are relatively easy. You need to show up and pay attention. She has weekly quizzes over  chapters so you need the book and you need to read. She will help if you ask for it. She works fast. Easy B, a little harder to get an A. Would recommend.
