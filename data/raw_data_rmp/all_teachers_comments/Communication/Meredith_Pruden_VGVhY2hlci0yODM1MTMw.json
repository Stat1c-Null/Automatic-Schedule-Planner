There are plenty of extra credit opportunities during class as long as you participate in class. Show up, read the textbook before class discussions, and do the quizzes and homework on time and this class will be a cake walk.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTAxNDg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2033","date_posted":"2024-12-31 04:51:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is one of the kindest and caring professors I've had at KSU. Please contact her if you ever need help with anything in the class. She will respond and genuinely cares about her students' success. She offers extra credit opportunities and grades fairly.

She's great at explaining though , and willing to help you . You have discussion post , and quizzes due every week , and also a final project which was so difficult . but overall she is far from terrible . I just wasn't a big fan of the topics we would discuss , boring .

She is very easy to reach outside of class & answers quickly. Drops a ton of grades at the end of the year + gives extra credit. Lectures were fun + actually interesting. She is very fun and engaging and gives great feedback. Quiz + discussion every week, some more difficult than others. Def take this class!

She is obviously very knowledgable about this class and makes it very fun to be apart of. You have discussions every week and either a quiz or a rumination (essay). Shes very flexible and makes assignments fun. Also a very philosophical class.
