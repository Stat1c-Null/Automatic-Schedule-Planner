He isn't a harsh grader which is nice, considering almost every assignment, my classmates and I were unsure of what he wanted and when he wanted it. He was a nice guy, but really confusing and I don't feel like I came out prepared.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDU2NTk0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He hasn't fully mastered the art of teaching yet, but he's not a harsh grader whatsoever. You MUST buy the textbook IMMEDIATELY when the semester starts b/c there are assignments due on the 2nd day of class. Reading the book is how you'll learn everything.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODc5MjQw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
