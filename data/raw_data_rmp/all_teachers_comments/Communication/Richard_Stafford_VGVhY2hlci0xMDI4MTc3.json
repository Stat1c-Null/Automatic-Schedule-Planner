I was very nervous when the class started, but he made it easy to settle in and become comfortable. He really knows public speaking and tells great stories that are relevant to the lecture. He is very easy going and laid back.

He is so engaged and he really makes you want to be there. I never wanted to miss a class. His grading is very fair and he is very clear about how he is going to grade you. Easy A!

What an AMAZING professor, I can already tell that I'm going to learn a lot from him. He made those 3 hours fly by, literally. He genuinely wants to make you succeed and he loves what he does. I'm so glad I chose him for my teacher for Public Speaking.

He is probably the most engaged proffessor, and overall best I have ever had. He will work well with any skill level you come to his class with!  He does a great job breaking the ice between the class, and making you feel comfortable.  Go to class! rehearse your speeches, AND ABOVE ALL ELSE DON'T TOUCH THE PODIUM!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDg0MzY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2129","date_posted":"2009-05-06 23:25:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Stafford teaches by example, not by lecturing out of a book. He does work with speaking engagements and commercial voiceovers so he knows what he's talking about. He is very friendly and supportive, even (and especially) to timid people who are terrified of speaking. I highly recommend him for Public Speaking.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NzgyODY2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COM2129","date_posted":"2009-03-10 14:37:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy A class... Stafford is very liberal minded and doesn't mind pushing his opinions on the class.  He loves to talk about himself.  If you can get past that, though, you'll see that he really does care about his students and helps everyone become confident with public speaking.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTIwMzc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMMTHW","date_posted":"2009-01-06 22:46:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is amazing!
