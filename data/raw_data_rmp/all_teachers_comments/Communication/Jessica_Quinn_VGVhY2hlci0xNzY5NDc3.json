Grades are not handed to you and she will be brutally honest with you. You cannot slack off. Homework every night - honestly, some of it was kind of fun because it was challenging.

Not a single lecture goes by where she won't inject her political or religious beliefs. Not offensive, just inappropriate. We got way behind, due to her lack of focus.

Don t ever consider missing any of her classes because some of her test's question come from random things she says I'm class that are not on the book or PowerPoint.
