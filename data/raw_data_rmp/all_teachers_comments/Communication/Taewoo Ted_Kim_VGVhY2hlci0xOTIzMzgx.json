Overall it is a very easy class, however the attendance policy is pretty ridiculous. After 2 missed classes you lose points off your final grade. Would have made an A without policy. The scope of the whole class is just an easy 7 page group paper.

The workload is lighter compared to previous sems. There is a language barrier, but he'll repeat things over  b/c he WANTS you to understand the material. Very nice. Work on your selected research question, 7 pg paper WITH group and present. 2 tests & quizzes. Quizzes easy STUDY for test.

He really wants you to succeed.  He's sometimes hard to understand because of his accent, but he knows this and will repeat himself as many times as necessary.  He's also pretty funny.

Very helpful and fair. He wants everyone in class to succeed. He has an accent and is a little hard to understand, but he will clarify as much as you need him to. He does not make the class any harder than it needs to be and understands that most of us have other classes and jobs.

He is very kind, but is a little difficult to understand because of his accent. But man does he try! His lectures are dry, but if you read, you will understand. He's such a nice person, but this class DEFINITELY does not need to be a required course for KSU Com majors..I have to say I didn't learn much.

The only complaint I have is that, while he will answer any questions you have, he is a bit passive aggressive when doing so. Sometimes you just need clarity on an assignment (better safe than sorry) and he will respond to an email, but include something like \"Check the syllabus before asking me questions.\" ","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTMxMTUz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM2020","date_posted":"2015-03-30 22:27:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love Professor Ted.

He doesn't speak great English, but he will repeat himself 100 times to make sure you are both on the same page. He has trimmed the final paper from 30 pages to 15, and 7 of them were literature review, which was easy. Tests were straight from online quizzes offered in the book. Easy A for a 3000 level class.
