She's sometimes a little late, but no one cares. Her tests are really easy, and she knows a lot about digital media production.

Although her class is fairly easy, I am actually learning a lot from it! She is very friendly and helpful. Put forth a little extra effor in the workbook assignments and you are sure to ace this course. If you are looking to off-set this semester with a less rigourous class, this is the one.

As a freshman, I had her one day a week and her teaching made the class go by really fast! Never had a boring day; we were given study guides for the tests; she dropped our lowest grade. Watched movies and had lots of group activities. Would definitely recommend her to anyone and would take any of her classes again!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Njk4MzY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMM1109","date_posted":"2009-12-14 23:30:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall I thought the class was extremely easy. She give study guide for every test. She allowed us to drop our lowest test grade including the final. I made an A in the class with little work. We mainly watched movies and the Cosby show.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTU1NTU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
