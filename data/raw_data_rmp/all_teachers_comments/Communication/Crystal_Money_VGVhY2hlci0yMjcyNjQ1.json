Each day you either got a grade from a quiz or a discussion and to get full credit you only had to speak once. There is a paper, 2 tests and quizzes. She offers extra credit at the end. She is really nice, speaks fast though, but I learned a lot.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDUxMDQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3600","date_posted":"2017-12-06 21:00:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Money is right on the money.
