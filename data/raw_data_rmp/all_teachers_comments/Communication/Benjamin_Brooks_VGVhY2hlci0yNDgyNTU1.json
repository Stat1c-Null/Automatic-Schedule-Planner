I took this class in the summer so it was extremely accelerated but he did a fantastic job explaining everything. I've never taken a leadership class, but he made it super simple and clear. He answered all my emails within minutes! If you get the chance, TAKE PROF. BROOKS!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjIxOTQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Accessible outside class--Online Savvy","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3000","date_posted":"2023-04-26 20:32:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing professor, Very passionate about teaching.

Dr. Brooks knows his research matter; he is extremely organized. You will know when every assignment and paper is due. He was a very generous grader. Fair warning: you will do a lot of writing in this class - literature reviews and a paper on a major research proposal.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Nzg5NTYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3401","date_posted":"2021-04-21 21:22:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Brooks is an excellent professor. He takes time to explain things well and provides students with everything they need to succeed in his classes. He also cares a lot about his students. This class was an insane amount of writing, but he gave multiple extensions and worked to make things easier.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTk0NTYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lecture heavy--So many papers","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3000","date_posted":"2020-12-02 20:53:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"I will be taking more of his courses in the future and changed my minor based on this one class. He was super fair with us and understood we have more going on in life than just his class. Three page papers due every week but he only grades three of them, the rest are just graded based on if you turned it in. Also, replies quickly.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTMwMzY4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Group projects--So many papers","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3000","date_posted":"2020-07-21 15:24:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"The material was very organized and easy to understand. The use of the discussion boards while there was a lot of them it was very effective to help internalize the information I learned from each PowerPoint.
