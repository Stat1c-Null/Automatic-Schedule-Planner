He uses academic papers as weekly texts. They were usually around 15-20 pages long. You have to complete 7 of 14 possible weekly summaries. He also provides Powerpoints for each of the readings, and often does lectures on the same readings. He gives good feedback on the summaries.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTYxNDg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MENT3326","date_posted":"2020-07-21 17:11:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was my second time taking Prof. Dunham. I will not take him again. He does not require a textbook but instead assigns weekly readings that you are quizzed over and must write summaries on. This wouldn't be difficult if the readings weren't 40+ pages of scholarly text that is not understandable to the student. Test are terrible. He is terrible.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTIyNzA4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MENT3100","date_posted":"2019-12-12 15:51:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Just ended the semester, and can honestly say this class was the best of the fall by a long shot.
