Connelly seems nice enough but goes on this weird power trip with students. Grades harshly. Syllabus and due dates don't match and discussion due dates change week by week. Her tests don't have study guides and are so specific. You'll teach yourself the software and flounder through the rest.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTY0NzQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PR4405","date_posted":"2019-03-21 04:11:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Firstly, if you aren't creative / if you don't care about being creative, Connelly's digital publication design class might be really tough for you. She is hilarious and super likable, but she makes you work for your grade. If you aren't great at creative projects, she gives really helpful feedback to improve your weaknesses.

I am not creative at all, but enjoyed designing stuff in this class! I left with designs I was actually proud of. The stuff she shows in class is actually interesting too.

If you are interested in learning design no matter what skill level you have, do yourself a service and take her. She is very caring &amp; understanding of her students and gives the most detailed feedback I've ever seen to let you know what could be improved upon. I started with horrible designs and left proud.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODg5NDk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM2010","date_posted":"2018-12-04 12:08:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"She gives A LOT of work. Lots of discussions and assignments. VERY HARD GRADER. Be prepared for a lot of critisism on your work. She assigns group projects for an online class. which was VERY hard because my group members lived out of the state and couldn't meet up with me &amp; never responded to me.

You will learn a lot about color, design, & the do's and don't of design. Initially thought that I wouldn't gain much from this class. I was wrong. Mrs. Connelly knows a lot and explains it in simple terms. Take this class, if you have the option.
