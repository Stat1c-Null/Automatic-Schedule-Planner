There is not a ton of homework, and the work is very easy. A couple of group projects; also very easy. Enjoyed the course content a lot, and Professor Sushil was very caring for his students. You can tell he really cares for you and your future career! Definitely recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODMxNDM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
