Not what it seems - I learned a lot about business, myself, teamwork, etc. However, none of that learning took place in the classroom. Be VERY careful about choosing your team members and be sure to submit a QUALITY project with ALL bases covered if you do not want to get REEMED in the presentation.

No lectures, but you get out of the class what you put into it.  Not an overly energetic &quot;go seize the world!&quot; rah rah type, but he guides the class and makes it enjoyable.  You'll have killer deliverables and the presentations are expected to be very professional.

The whole semester we only had lecturers that we had to bring in as groups. He never taught, never answered questions, but boy was he quick to look down his glasses at u if u did something he didn't like. I hated him so much I changed majors.
