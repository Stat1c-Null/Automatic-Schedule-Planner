The individual work was easy and the tests were straight forward but the group projects shot me in the foot. I hope whoever takes her place will set up a more fair system for future students. Peer Evaluations were half your grade for each project. If you get a bad group, kiss your A goodbye.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTMwNjc4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4002","date_posted":"2014-05-07 11:05:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor.

She has online quizzes that you can take an unlimited amount of times and takes the highest grade. You don't have to read the textbook, but I recommend it anyway. A few tests, a couple assignments.
