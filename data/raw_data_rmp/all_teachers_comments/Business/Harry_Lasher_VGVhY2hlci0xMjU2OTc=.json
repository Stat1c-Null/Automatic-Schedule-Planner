The tests are long and difficult but if you can write, you'll do well. Lasher is an excellent teacher and definitely one of the best I've had.

He is very experienced in his field, but has no idea how to convey it. Any information outside of what he says is useless. Not lenient AT ALL on answers to tests and discussions.
