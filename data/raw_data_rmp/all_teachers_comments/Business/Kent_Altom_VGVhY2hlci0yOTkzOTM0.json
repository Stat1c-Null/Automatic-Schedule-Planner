He genuinely wants you to succeed and cares about his students. Tests were at home, but lockdown + Webcam. Attend the classes and review sessions, and you will be fine. TAKE HIM. He is a wonderful professor.

This class is tough though. Personally, I didn't read the textbook so it probably could have been easier but. Great dude, always available to help and you can tell he loves his students.

A lot of slides and lecturing, plus a project, but he is very helpful and offers a lot of time outside of class to help the material stick. Fantastic instructor.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NjM5MzE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Amazing lectures --Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
