You can honestly finish all of the assignments required in one month! They are mostly reflection assignments and you have one career meeting with him and he discusses your career goals for after college!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDA0OTIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BUSA3150","date_posted":"2021-12-03 03:38:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"BUSA coaches tend to be impersonal and uninvolved, but I loved having Rey for 3150. Our mandatory coach meeting was impactful and enjoyable. I'm taking him next semester for 4150! If you have to choose between him and another, definitely pick Rey!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzU2MTI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BUSA3150","date_posted":"2021-08-06 01:47:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class was easy and straightforward enough however Versola waited til the last week to give us credit in suitable for stuff which as you can imagine had most of the class having heart palpitations.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDA5NzE4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"BUSA4150","date_posted":"2020-12-14 22:01:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"You don't really have a choice for your BUSA professor because it's based on your major, but he's a really nice guy! My career meeting with him was really great and he tried his hardest to give me as many resources as possible from it.

Coach Versola truly cares about his students and is quick to respond with answers to your questions or feedback. I finished this class in early October and didn't have to do anything for the rest of the semester. You have to complete a certain number of assignments on Suitable - all easy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDA5NTY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BUSA3150","date_posted":"2020-07-30 23:24:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had a great experience with this prof! This class is P/F so you just have to make sure you do the assignments and put some effort in, and you're fine. My meeting with him (required to pass) was an great experience and he was super encouraging. I look forward to having him again next semester! Don't sweat this class, just submit everything.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTQ3NTM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BUSA3150","date_posted":"2018-11-05 17:50:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took him for BUSA3150, would not recommend-- but for Marketing majors, he is the only choice you get. For a class that is FREE for no credit, I find it insane that you have to purchase a textbook. The mandatory 1 hour meeting (for online students) is such a waste of time and so unnecessary.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjYyNjgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
