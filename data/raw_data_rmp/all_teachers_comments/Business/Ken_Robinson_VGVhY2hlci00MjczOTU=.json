He rants a lot and preaches his political views the whole class. Doesn't grade anything in a remotely timely manner and isn't a big fan of helping students. Definitely don't recommend him for 4199. Take Wermert.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTE5MzQ2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4120","date_posted":"2012-05-11 13:08:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is funny.

He's hilarious. Go to class, there is a participation grade. Follow directions for assignments. No tests. No final. I'd definitely take him again if I wasn't graduating.

I would take him over again in the future.  His tests are surprisingly tough, but are just off his PP slides and the book. There is a big group project that I felt had little structure.  He used his real life work experience as backing for his lectures.  I have/will recommend him to others.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODYzNzIx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4120","date_posted":"2010-12-04 20:47:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall the class was easy. However don't expect to be able to get in touch with him after hours. His syllabus says he can be reached by appointment only but good luck trying to get him to respond.
