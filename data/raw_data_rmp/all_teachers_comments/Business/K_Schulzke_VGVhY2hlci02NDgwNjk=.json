His ego is all that fits in the class there is very little room for any learning left. This class has the potential to be great but his personality and teaching style destroy any chance of the class being truly usefull. There is no real organization and he rarely posts grades in a timely fashion.

He is arrogant, and never directly answers a question. The exams are take home and most people still fail. Budget at least 7 hours for each exam. One good thingâ€¦ he will adjust exam grades if you provide good arguments for \"wrong\" answers.
