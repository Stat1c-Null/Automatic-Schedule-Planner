He only grades on three things at the end of the semester and you are in competition with your classmates for grades as he grades on a curve.

You will not know where you stand at all until the end of the class. That being said, professor is nice and lectures are laid-back but I don't think it really gets the point of wanting students to learn instead of memorize things across.

His class isn't the most organized and all of the relevant content that will be on tests and the project is discussed in class.
