He is a very great guy, he teaches the material well, and gives out key pointers. There are four tests and a group project. He lets you use a piece of paper, which you can put anything on, to use on your tests. 10/10 definitely recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzI0NDIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3100","date_posted":"2023-04-13 16:50:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Parke is the best!

Guys this is a MUST take professor. You actually learn from his lectures along with being just a very likable person. Group project is hefty but very doable. 18 pages single spaced with 5 people. You have the whole semester. Tests are open note (Sheet of paper) and his review slides are literally the test. MUST. TAKE.

He gives no HW, 4 tests, and a semester long 18-20 pg. paper with a 15 min ppt presentation which he has no control over. He allows a cheat sheet for tests which are pretty easy. Show up and do the group project you will be fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDQ3MDIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--So many papers","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2021-12-08 22:44:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved Professor Parke. He did amazing, especially for his first time teaching. Group Project that was pretty difficult, but he graded fairly. Four tests where you can bring a cheat sheet that are simple as long as you prepare off the review slides. He is super funny and great to be around. I think he will only do better for future students!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDI2MDE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKTG3100","date_posted":"2021-12-06 17:25:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Perry is a very nice professor and i enjoyed his class. 4 tests which are medium difficulty, he lets you have a cheat sheet on all 4.
