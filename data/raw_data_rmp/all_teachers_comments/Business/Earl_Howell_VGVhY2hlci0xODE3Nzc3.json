There were a lot of group presentations, which were kind of annoying but they were not too hard. The midterm and final were both take home.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjM4NDY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT8910","date_posted":"2014-10-25 20:22:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"He takes class and next class is always presentation. has too much expections from students. Essentially, does not spend much time on teaching but makes you work so hard.  I am about to go crazy. other students do not like him much about his way of teaching. Though he is nice gentleman otherwise.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjk0NjA0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2014-08-06 12:23:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great guy, loves the subject. But the subject is so boring and difficult. The team questions are very difficult however he is willing to help you out. Not mandatory attendance. Don't buy the book. I would recommend him, but be aware that Operations MGT is a boring awful subject regardless of how great he is. He is helpful with questions.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTA0NTYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2014-05-08 07:46:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Howell is a very nice person. However, he was not available for most of the time. Students were unsure when things were due and did not receive response to their email until weeks after. I took the course online so if you plan on taking him, its best to do it on campus.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTk1NjE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGMT4004","date_posted":"2013-12-03 11:29:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"No nonsense knowledge that brings actual up to date and relevant business knowledge to the table. He is old, but his business knowledge is up to date. very sharp and informative.  Tests are mixed variety. First one was tough but fair, and second one was very easy (class avg 10 people was a 94).  Gotta stay on top of the game.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDE5OTQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2013-11-08 18:30:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor. You only need this book: \"Operations Management Jay HEIZER Barry RENDER 9th Edition\" It's about $10 on amazon and will get you through the course with an A. TESTS ARE 1/3 M/C; 1/3 Short Answers; 1/3 Math (he provides all formulas).

Class was based off Vic Marshal's online course. Make sure you are in a good group, there is a weekly team problem. Tests are made by the department. Really nice guy, boring professor!!
