I found myself actually enjoying the excel work which is 99.99% of the class btw so prepare to learn a lot in excel. He will respond to ALL of your emails quickly.

His lectures are not only recorded live, but available at all times, so if you miss something you can always go back and watch class again.

Attend his class and get quizzes for extra-credit on your exams. They will definitely save your life. Be sure to do all assignments on time and you will finish this class with at least a B. If you want an A, be sure to ask questions, take notes, and practice scenarios for the exam.

If you put in the work, he will do his best to ensure the best grade possible for you. Three exams, multiple quiz options, five assignments, and two excel assignments so a pretty good amount of grades. Responds quickly, do your best and communicate with him and you'll be fine.

A lot of the class is brief yet informational lectures, and excel based labs. He is very flexible when test time comes around by either curving grades, or he will take out sections that he feels it was to challenges based on the homework assignment grades.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjIzNzA0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECON2300","date_posted":"2021-04-20 01:23:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"There is a definite effort but the man is genuinely just not very good at explaining things.
