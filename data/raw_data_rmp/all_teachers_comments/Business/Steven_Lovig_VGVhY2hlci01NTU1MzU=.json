Some of the information is a bit redundant, some of it is interesting.  Professor Lovig is nice and approachable, quite unorganized, and easily manipulated (suggest that a due date gets moved, he'll likely move it).

Left the entire class confused on what was needed to be done. 12 quizzes (unlimited attempts) lowest 4 were dropped, 2 tests, 2 papers, 3 online discussions (was supposed to be 4). Not sure if prof actually read the papers or just gave a 100 for completion.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTI4MTk2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4170","date_posted":"2010-12-05 12:54:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"MGT 4170.  I felt this was an easy class ? I got an A.  I took him for the online section.  Quizzes could be taken as many time as you needed.  Tests were limited to 1 attempt.  I think my class caught him at a time where his day job and life got a bit busy for him.  There were a few times were we went 2-2 Â½ weeks without hearing anything from him.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODYzNzg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4170","date_posted":"2008-12-11 23:55:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor.
