All of the work is based around a singular group project, and he does not believe in the use of any kind of technology. (He makes you print PowerPoint slides to use in the projector.)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjc3MjA2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
