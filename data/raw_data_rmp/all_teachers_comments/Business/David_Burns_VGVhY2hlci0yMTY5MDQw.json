Professor basically ignored the asynchronous section of the class, we had to attend the lectures during the synchronous section to get any course info, including announcements. Prof teaches about economics, not web development.

This course requires a ton of SELF LEARNING, and he allows each group to choose how they want to build and design the project, and focuses on usability & app function. He forgets about the online async class at times, don't miss his in person (teams) class, he gives hints at how he grades!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjA4NjUw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SWE4713","date_posted":"2023-10-01 23:41:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class is based around building an online web application that he teaches you nothing about. Learning modules in the class were about accounting, nothing about an application. Lectures are given in the in person class and withheld from people in the online section if you're not in teams at specific time when class is held, supposed to be async","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjQ1Nzk3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
