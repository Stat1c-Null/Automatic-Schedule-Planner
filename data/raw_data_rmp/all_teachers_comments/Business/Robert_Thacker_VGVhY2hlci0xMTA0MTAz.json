He will embarrass you!!! I would take him again but some days I didn't feel like listening to his drill sergeant style lectures.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NzY5Mzcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGNT3105","date_posted":"2011-04-28 18:58:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best teacher i have had all year. He is extremely stern. He may seem like a harda**, but he gets the job done, and teaches based upon a &quot;been there, done that&quot; situation, but in a good way. If you show up to lecture, and just listen, there is no need to take notes because it will be burned into your memory. 5/5","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDg4NDc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGMT4125","date_posted":"2011-04-07 19:27:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very good teacher makes his class fun will help you if you neadd it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Mzc0NzI0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGNT6090","date_posted":"2010-09-21 10:46:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"His comments and advise will live with your for the rest of your life.  Amazing teacher and person.  Use him as a mentor.  Lots of corporate and book experience. Well travelled and opend minded. The class and project are tough, but you will learn a lot.

Test are open book but are very hard so you still need to study. I received a C. in the class because I couldn't always study. If I studied more I would've received in A.

I'll say this, He is tough, but fair, and at the end of the day, you will learn to respect his style of teaching and walk away learning something or not.

The group project is about as fun as a project can be, and he takes you through it step by step.  Attendance is mandatory, but his lectures are pretty intense, so at least its not boring. Def recommended if you just want an easy passing grade and to actually learn somethin","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NzgzODk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
