Funny and personable and it's pretty easy to get her off track!  Definitely knows her stuff when it comes to IT but sometimes forgets that she's basically speaking a foreign language to the rest of us (um hello- layman's terms please!!).","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTc4NjU5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS3280","date_posted":"2016-12-17 19:07:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dull class and the instructor is a bore.

There are two exams, and if you get less than a 70% average between them, you fail.  Additionally, the group project is a pain if your group is unorganized. She doesn't take attendance, but has mandatory participation points to encourage interaction in class. Bad class, okay prof.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzA1Nzgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?
