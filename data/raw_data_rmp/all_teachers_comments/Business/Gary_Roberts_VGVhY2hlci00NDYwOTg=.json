I've taken him since 3100 and he's a great professor and an even better guy. Took him for the capstone strategic management online. Learned a lot and credit much of my deeper understanding of  businesses and how they function to this class. TAKE HIM!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDgzOTI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2011-12-07 15:06:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is a JOKE. If you want to spend hours doing pointless busy work that teaches you nothing, this class is for you. If you actually enjoy learning and want to benefit from a class, STAY AWAY from this professor. The work load for this (3100 level) class is ridiculous. This professor is pompous and egotistical, i do NOT recommend him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDExNzAw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2011-05-10 13:02:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"HE is a very blunt person and doesn't care for foolish questions/mistakes however... 20% of your grade is discussions which requires 3 posts PER WEEK of 3 sentences. 20% is Learnsmart quizzes which don't even grade you, they are just completion based. Another 20% is the service learning which was easy just time consuming.

He is pretty understanding and fair in grading. Only 2 tests a midterm and a final (both online). They have a few short essays and multiple choice quizes but are open a long time. There is also weekly work & a Service Learning.

Get to know him, as he is the head of SIFE. Though them I was able to get an internship with a very cool new company. This is the only professor you should be considering for MGT 3100. Interesting, useful class material, plus hes fair.

He is so weird though. Talks nonstop about germans(if there are any in your class) and his daughter in-law. Also makes you do a Service Learning..it's all you will talk about until Mid October.

Wants to see you either do well or bomb with no in between.  If you give a little effort though, he'll make sure you do well.  His class is a lot of fun.

Frequently sarcastic when answering questions.  Tests, and the material in general, weren't hard.

The service learning project that he assigns is way too unclear and just helps him out and not you.
