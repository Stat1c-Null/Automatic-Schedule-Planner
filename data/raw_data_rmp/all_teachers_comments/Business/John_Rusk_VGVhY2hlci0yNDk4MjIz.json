Each week we had a quiz, lab, podcast response and discussion questions. Nothing difficult, just tedious. Fortunately he is very responsive to emails and is an easy grader. If you do the work and make an effort, its an easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTc4NTg2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR3100","date_posted":"2020-03-25 18:24:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took his CYBR 3100 and CYBR 3210 class and they were great. He would always respond to email and provide help if needed. Also, you have weekly assignments for both classes. The grading of both classes are different but other than that, I would take him.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTkyMzY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Get ready to read","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR3200","date_posted":"2019-07-23 14:56:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"I've had Dr. Rusk twice and he has been consistent with both classes. He is fair with grading and will adjust quizzes if there are obvious problems. I learned a lot in this class through the security tools in homework labs. Tests are open book/open notes. Start the work/modules early so you don't fall behind. Would take again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMTE1Mjk1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISA3100","date_posted":"2019-05-29 04:02:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took him during maymester and there was a ton of work. It wasn't too difficult, but it was tedious and he's lenient with grading. He can be unorganized at times, but responds to emails quickly. If you read the book's key terms and review the quizzes, you'll do fine on the tests. Made us use lockdown browser with webcam for the tests.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTY4NTU4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
