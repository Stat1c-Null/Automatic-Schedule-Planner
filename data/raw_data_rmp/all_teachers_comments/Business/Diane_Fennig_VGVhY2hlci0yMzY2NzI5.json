You can work ahead &amp; finish the class as early as you wish. Must attend job fairs! (All over Zoom or Teams because of COVID) Diane Fennig was very rude &amp; discouraging. She's supposed to be a &quot;career coach&quot; when rather she made me feel as if I was behind &amp; dumb. She is not a nice lady.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTMzODUx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"BUSA3150","date_posted":"2020-10-21 23:00:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"While this is an easy class, Professor Fennig lacks all skills needed to be an efficient career coach. She is highly opinionated and if you dont have the perfect answer she will consistently fight you on it. The mandatory career coach meeting was nothing short of a joke. No coaching was done, she will put you down on every single choice you've made","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzIyNTE4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"BUSA2150","date_posted":"2020-05-06 07:01:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Only met her once, but she was really encouraging. She encouraged everyone to meet her at least once. I dont think she provides a syllabus, but if you ask, she might give a layout of the hard deadlines she has. I did all events online and it was simple. Answer the prompts, but do not write an essay. The work is straight forward &amp; simple.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjE2OTYz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BUSA2150","date_posted":"2020-05-03 05:30:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took her as my &quot;professor&quot; for an online 0 credit class.

Not a lot of work. Very interesting and helpful in my opinion. You work at your own pace, but there are a few hard deadlines. 2 graded videos (intro &amp; prescreening interview), 2 graded assignments + 1 final quiz.

You have 3 meetings with her throughout the entire series. She plays devils advocate but that's her way of making sure you have a real plan for your major.
