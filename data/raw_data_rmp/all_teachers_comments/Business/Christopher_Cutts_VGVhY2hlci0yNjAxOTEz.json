He has humor, is transparent, and gives plenty of time to complete work. His lectures keep you interested and are very clear. On top of that, he is laid back and wants to ensure everyone has a fair chance to earn a good grade. 10/10 Would absolutely take again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1Nzk3Mzc5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS3100","date_posted":"2022-01-07 15:26:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the worst professor/teacher I have ever taken in my entire life! He has NO respect for his students and will cancel class last minute, and then threaten anyone who doesn't show up to class (even for 1 day) to fail them. He also accuses people of plagiarism who clearly did their own work. He's just aweful.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzE1Mjk1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IS3100","date_posted":"2021-12-01 21:54:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy started out chill. However around midway through the semester he switched up. Had a power trip and gave everyone who didnt show up on a certain day a 0 on a case study. Cancels classes all the time but throws a fit if you miss a single class.

D2L is a mess and doesn't give clear standards for assignments, yet says he does. He's openly rude to students in class that ask questions that maybe they missed, and I was scared constantly throughout the semester to ask questions when I didn't understand something. Easy class with large project at the end.

He just wants to see you try. If you show up and participate, you will pass. He asks the students that show up when they want to set the due dates, so that is why people claim to not know when things are due (they did not show up).","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NTE5MDgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
