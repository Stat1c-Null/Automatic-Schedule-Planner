Four roleplay videos that are the tests for this class. Quizzes every week but easy and open book. He does grade attendance but only 5%.

Provides a real world insight into the world of selling and his main concern is on students being able to apply information and tactics to a real world scenario. The quizzes can be difficult but they're open note. I learned a lot from him and if I could take him again I would.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTg5Nzgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MKG3140","date_posted":"2022-12-05 19:44:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved taking Professor Scruggs! This was his first semester teaching. Super chill, very understanding, gave lots of grace when needed. Gentle with grading the 4 roleplays. Beware of difficult quizzes, though. He will learn your name if you come to class regularly. Brought us little treats on occasion. Great guy and great professor!

He brings a lot of real-world experience to the table. Gives great advice on career topics. Open note quiz each week. Attendance is a grade. Role-plays are fun bc he just wants you to get comfortable speaking professionally.
