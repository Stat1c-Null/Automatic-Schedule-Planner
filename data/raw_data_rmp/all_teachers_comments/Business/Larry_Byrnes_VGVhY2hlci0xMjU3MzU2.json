He's a sweet old man, however not best at explaining things to students. He's a little too knowledgeable. Save your GPA and take another professor.

Old being 60+. Hes very knowledgeable; however too knowledgeable. Just another professor that doesn't know how to simplify for us common folk. Requires way too much work to be a general ed class. Sadly, this is a prereq for us COMM majors that need Digital Media. I'm positive I won't get a C this time around :(","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzkyMzcy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT2101","date_posted":"2012-12-03 12:19:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Attendance mandatory. I took HYBRID. Sometimes when ppl ask questions he cant answer clearly because he is so knowledgable that it still comes out like jibberish to the person who asked the question. He is very nice and excited to teach but class is boring.

Super funny! There is a lot of work to do but its pretty easy if your good with computers. If you need help on anything you can call his house and he will link to your computer and help.

The class requires you to do work, attend class, and (oh my goodness!) READ THE BOOK! If you do this and follow the directions posted in the weekly module you'll ace the class. He's VERY open to helping you and even gives you his phone #. He's entertaining in what I thought was going to be a boring computer class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzkxOTAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BISM2100","date_posted":"2010-10-06 01:34:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Guys a two faced jerk. Classes are supposed to be learning experiences. We are obviously going to school for a reason. He grades as if we are trained professionals. He hardly teaches enough for people to actually complete his assignments correctly. You get one number wrong, it's a zero for the grade. Don't take this guy. Don't you do it!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjM0NjU0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BISM2100","date_posted":"2009-10-27 19:02:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you have little computer experience like I had, you might not want to take him. Though, on the other hand this class has forced me to learn a lot. He grades very hard on the SEVERAL online-submission projects and a lot of confusion erupts with his assignments because of his direction.

Most of my classes I am bored however this class keep my interest. He grades very tough on assignments. You have a stupid pop quiz everytime you come to class, which is one question.
