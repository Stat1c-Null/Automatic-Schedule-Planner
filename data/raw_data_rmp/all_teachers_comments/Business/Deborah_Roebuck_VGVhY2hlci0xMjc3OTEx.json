Roebuck makes it the most interactive of any class you'll take at KSU.  The workload is the main drawback... format borders on busywork, at times, but this is a course that helps you beyond just completing an elective!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzM3MTY2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT8970","date_posted":"2011-11-29 13:23:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Roebuck has a very unique teaching method which includes weekly quizzes - meaning reading of the entire textbook is mandatory. She lets you set the weights on grades (team, individual, etc). This class is fairly labor intensive which is odd for an elective. Do the work and you'll get an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzI5NjU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4161","date_posted":"2010-12-17 09:54:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is a business elective course, but don't be fooled.  This is easily the most involved, busywork-loaded class I've had in my entire college career.  There are usually 3-5 assignments due every single week and each requires a good deal of time.
