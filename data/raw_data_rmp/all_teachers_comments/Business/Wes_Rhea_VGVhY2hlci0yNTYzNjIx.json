There were 4 six page papers throughout the semester. Thankfully they were mostly opinion based so it was not difficult. He grades easily too. I made 100s on almost all of them. Really nice guy! Decided to sign up for another class of his.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzU0ODUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--So many papers","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS4490","date_posted":"2020-12-09 07:57:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Rhea's style is very relaxed but he hits all of his lecture points. Exams are very similar to the chapter quizzes and both of those pull questions directly from the book or provided reading material. The only thing I dislike is we had a re-accruing paper that had minimum page requirements while limiting us to 11 font and 1.5 spacing.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTk3Mjc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
