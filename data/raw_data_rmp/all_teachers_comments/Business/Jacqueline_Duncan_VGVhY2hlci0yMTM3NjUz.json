You will earn an A if you attend class, participate, and learn the material in the study-guides for her tests! She is a Six Sigma Blackbelt with process improvement experience at large corporations, and also leads process improvement initiatives at Kennesaw. Very knowledgable and caring. Take her!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDAzMDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4850","date_posted":"2016-12-13 18:44:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Don't take advantage of her kindness, you must go to class and listen. 80% of the graded material is short answer so you are going to be expected to absorb concepts in class. The course itself covers nothing difficult in nature but you will leave with a new perspective that intellectual students crave. She will not waste your time with busy work.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDc0Njg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Only 2nd semester teaching though. So no one signs up for her class. She has real world experience with the subject and also a great teacher. Very clear in what she expects from you on tests, quizzes, and project. She wants you to do well. Show up regularly and you will. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDQzMzA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
