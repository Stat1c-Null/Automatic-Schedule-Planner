However Be prepared to present and work (3 articles, 1 franchise presentation, 1 group presentation, 2 Tests, and a Paper) All are extremely easy though. Really enjoyed this class it was a Easy A and this is coming from a B student. Do the work and you will be fine.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzM2NjQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4124","date_posted":"2012-12-14 04:02:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor.

The time spent in class was enjoyable and the workload was fair.  The schedule on the syllabus was changed a lot throughout the semester due to rescheduling, so that messed with the consistency of knowing what was going on from week to week. He's good, just not totally clear.

Knew what he was talking about and had interesting stories to relate with material.  Attendance not always mandatory. Tests are very to the point and just like the study guides.
