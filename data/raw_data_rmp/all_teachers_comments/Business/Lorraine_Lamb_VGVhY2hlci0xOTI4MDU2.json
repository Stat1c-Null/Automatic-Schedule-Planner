I got an easy A out of it, but I did have to put in the effort. Quizzes are super easy, save your questions and answers for the midterm and final because they are very tough. Good intentions she had though. Job well done!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTEyNjM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2014-12-16 23:57:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"She has good intentions, but is a bit confusing at times. Her lectures mainly consist of somewhat relevant material, but you will have to teach yourself in this class. The good thing is that if you know how to use Microsoft Office, you should do fine if you have the books for the class. You can get an A, but you have to work for it, big time!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTEyMjMx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2014-12-16 23:33:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"What can I say about Professor Lamb? Well at the beginning of the semester I thought it was going to be fun, and it was, but for different reasons than her. There was a 10 page group paper as well as an oral presentation due at the end. Also, the Midterm and Final are extremely hard to study for; however, most of grades were quizzes  easy","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MTExODI2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2014-12-14 23:45:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"How do you like your teachers? Full of enthusiasm, willingness to calmly clarify issues, and offers wisdom that will stick with you long after the class is done? DO NOT TAKE LAMB! Be prepared for lectures revolving her life and not the book, questions met with argumentative belittlement and dirty looks, and a self-taught course graded harshly.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDc5NTI5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS2200","date_posted":"2014-12-14 23:45:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Most frustrating class I have ever had the misfortune of taking! This class includes: impossible exams, 10 page papers, powerpoint-formatted novels, over the top Excel projects, and rude remarks from the teacher.  Attending was a waste of time; no test material actually covered; students played Clash of Clans and Netflix the whole time.

She does not want to help neither does she listen to what the students have to say. Everything she does is based of another teacher. She can be a little cruel with grading.

Since day one she never seemed like she had a clue of what was going on. DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH! I asked her to explain a topic more clearly and she told me that it was a self taught class & she didn't need to.(not online class) If you want to teach yourself about IS then take her class.

What she teaches doesn't help us for the test, but is based off of her \"work experience\". She takes attendance but is not a big grade. If you want to learn from the book I would not advise taking her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjcxOTMy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
