He worked for IBM for 25 years, you will learn a lot. Only two test online open book, notes and internet! Group project that makes up 35 % of the grade. He cut the oral presentation out becuase we ran out of time, just had to do voiceovers. Take him it won't get any easier!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTIxNzA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BISM2100","date_posted":"2009-11-19 14:33:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super easy. Nice guy, easy teacher. My only problem is that this class is pretty much useless. I learned nothing about word, excel, or powerpoint that I didn't already know.

Has lots of experience in business so listen to him! Tests are online & you can use book, notes and computer. Projects aren't hard, pay attention to your grammar and spelling!

He is funny and makes this class fly by. He knows what he's talking about. In this class you are constantly doing something, but then again this also gives you more grades. He gives extra credit, and takes attendance randomly. I LOVED HIM!

Relates his business experience to material. A mid term and final along with lots of projects make for a challenging course.
