The main assignments were weekly discussions. 70% of your final grade though is 3 \"quizzes\" and the midterm and final, but they're open-note and all pretty easy as long as you prepare. Great guy, met him at the corporate events we were required to attend. The only annoying part of the class was waiting ages to get grades back","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzIyMTI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HMGT3397","date_posted":"2023-12-13 18:12:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Meeting Dr. Jackson has been the greatest blessing of my college career.
