He gives a lot of info about his experience as a lawyer and its good. Nobody really ever goes to the classes so sit up around the front and get to know him, he is a cool professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzk4ODUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Amazing lectures --Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW-2200","date_posted":"2025-01-06 19:21:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly a really good person and teacher, attendance is not required but necessary to understand the application of terms rather than just definitions","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDkyODYz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW-2200","date_posted":"2024-11-22 17:04:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's very sweet and funny, he does ramble a little but its important to the subject because he was a lawyer and they're all on the concept he's teaching atm. The worst part is the smartbook assignments which take hours each and there's one for every chapter. Tests are hard if you like cramming beforehand bc BLAW is a heavy course","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDE0MDM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW-2200","date_posted":"2024-11-12 21:39:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Truthfully, I did not attend class often as the material is easy to complete without attending. He truly loves teaching and law and that's what makes him a great professor. I wish the tests were more like the smartbook activities though.

But he rambles a lot and it can make you zone out. Study guides are very brief and long. Expect to understand and analyze each term when used in real world situation. Suggest to go over smart books constantly for test prep.

Very easy as long as you follow the requirments, easy 100. Easy 4 exams :)  and final. WOULD TAKE AGAIN. Great professor  if you just need to take the class and pass.
