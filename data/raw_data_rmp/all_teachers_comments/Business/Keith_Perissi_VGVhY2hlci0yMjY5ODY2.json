Pretends to care but is very rude and condescending. MEBUS was the reason I chose KSU but Keith ruined the experience. If u can't dedicate a majority of your time to MEBUS then don't waste any of your time. A friend warned me before but I didn't listen bc it seemed like a good opportunity.

He is someone who will look to push you to achieve what you want.

Keith came off as being a caring and passionate individual, but my views of him changed quickly when i started the class. He is very condescending, calls you out, claims to know &quot;everyone,&quot; and an all around rude individual.
