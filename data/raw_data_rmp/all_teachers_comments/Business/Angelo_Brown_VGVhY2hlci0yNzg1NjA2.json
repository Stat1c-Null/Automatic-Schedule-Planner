Class was participation-based, he loves to interact with his students. He was funny and always cracking jokes. You can make up assignments. Graded on 2 group projects, 2 discussions, and 4 exams, which were fairly easy. Show up to class and participate and you will pass.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDY0NDE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2024-10-10 03:03:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's pretty all over the place ngl just go with another prof at KSU","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODAxMTQ0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2022-12-17 15:32:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Brown had the whole class laughing all semester. He's an interesting guy that works in the field. He gives real life context and doesn't work out of the textbook. He's very insightful and holds mainly group discussions. Grades super easy. My only thing with him is that he is very disorganized and does not post things on time. Definitely take him!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTY5NDUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2022-12-15 17:43:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lectures are entertaining and funny. Very few assignments (4 discussions, 3 tests, 1 group project). Although, his schedules and directions are confusing and not organized. Regardless, semi-easy class.

He has several discussion posts and case studies during the semester, but they are all very easy and straightforward. Make sure to participate in class and you will have a fun semester, he really loves to have class discussion. His tests are also straightforward and he provides you with all the information you need.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzIzNzk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Hilarious","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
