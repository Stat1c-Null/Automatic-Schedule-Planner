Lapides has a big personality, but he is very nice guy. Make sure you learn micromatic well and get in a good group and you should be ok. Tests are hard, but he knows that, so he curves the grades.

I took him online and I was stressing out the whole time. His test are insane. He gives a studyguide but DO NOT rely on it you have to study hard. The class is based on a simulation you must complete with a group and it counts half of your grade. Pick a reliable team!! Do not take this lightly if you do not do good on the simulation you will probably have to retake the class. You have to give a presentation on your simulated company so do a good job!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjUwNzQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BUS4120","date_posted":"2012-04-05 17:35:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor will help you if he likes you.

Your success in this class is based on your group. You have to do the simulation with your group, as well as a business plan and annual report, which are about 20 pages each.

There is some work involved, but everything you do counts!  Learn the simulation and honestly grasp it.  If you have problems ask other students in class and work until you understand it.

Lapides shares his experiences and wisdom freely, much of which I will use. However, no real schedule is followed, much of his grading on projects seems to be solely based on whether or not he likes you and what your gender is.
