She grades you hard, and it's for reasons in which you may not be able to control.\n\nAlso get ready to do 3D for most of this class, she will give Bs and Cs for 2D stuff.\n\nApparently she does not read her own rubric and gives you a lower grade because of it.\n","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTUyMjY1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1100","date_posted":"2024-03-01 00:43:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"She made us buy an expensive set of paints. We did not get to experiment with many mediums gave us little creative freedom on our projects, and we would have to follow these limiting color schemes. Do not try making friends in this class because she will separate you guys and create a seating chart for the class.

She's a younger teacher and has her students call her by her first name, which was a little strange at first but easy to get used to.
