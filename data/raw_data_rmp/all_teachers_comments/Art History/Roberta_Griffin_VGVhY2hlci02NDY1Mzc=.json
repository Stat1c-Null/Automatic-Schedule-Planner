Shes super unclear with her expectations and when you ask her a question she just runs around it without actually answering anything. Nice lady, just really frustrating.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODM5ODY2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"SO MANY PAPERS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ARH4490","date_posted":"2017-10-10 22:52:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"She doesn't actually teach you anything, she just struggles to get powerpoint up for the first half of the class and then goes off on an irrelevant tangent the second half of the class. She's really nice, she's just a terrible teacher.

But let me say if you get bored easy and hate boring classes do not take her. She is nice and passionate, but her grading, lectures, and complete lack of tech skills is almost a joke. Class breakdown: 45min fighting with powerpoint, 30 min of lecture.  This is on most days unfortunately. Mandatory museum/theater/and music visit.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTE4MDIx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1150","date_posted":"2010-01-25 22:45:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"I'll agree, she is flighty, but she is a great drawing teacher. If she happens to be teaching it, take it with her. She will encourage you and guide you in building your drawing skills.

She's really bad with technology so most of the class period will be her trying to get Power Point to work. Papers are a breeze and so are the tests.

Spent entire first day of class organizing student seating by last name, in reverse. Every instructor teaching this course uses same department-mandated syllabus, with mandatory attendance at museums, theatre events, and musical performances. Also requires a group project. So avoid the class altogether.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MDQxMzkz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INTROTOART","date_posted":"2005-07-28 15:49:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Kindy flighty/disorganized but dept instituted CPS--it sucks! Very nice, helpful, accomodating. Can tell she loves art. Tries to inspire students to explore the arts. Group presentation is required--what a waste of time and annoying.Required to attend theatre and music performances and daytrip to High Museum.
