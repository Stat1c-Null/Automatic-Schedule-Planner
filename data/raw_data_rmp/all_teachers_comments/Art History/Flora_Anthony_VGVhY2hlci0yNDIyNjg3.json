She does amazing lectures and makes learning the content easy and even enjoyable. Although there are few assignments, so little for grades, she gives plenty of extra credit. The tests are somewhat hard, but she basically gives you exactly what to study.

It was a new thing for her and adopted someone elses course online so dates were off and it was difficult to know when things were due cause everything was dated differently.

She's clearly passionate about art history and makes the lectures interesting. I definitely walked out of this class liking art history a lot more than when I came in.

However, most of her lectures are fairly entertaining since a lot of it is learning about history or cultures. It's not necessary to read the book if you pay attention in class, but it certainly helps.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzY3Njc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2021-01-12 02:31:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her in 2019 before covid.

Solid choice if you just need to get your gen ed appreciation class out of the way. If you show up to class and pay basic attention, you'll hear all you need to know.
