Professor Houseman is very passionate about what he teaches, and so long as you take notes and read the textbook, you'll be fine. He is also very generous when grading, as long as you can show you know the material.

He exclusively tests on niche and confusing content, so by no means are his quizzes/tests intuitive, even with studying. The notes that are posted are sparse and useless if you are not entirely engaged in every waking moment of his lectures.

He is a great guy and enjoys what he teaches. It is very lecture-based so you need to go to class since his PowerPoints aren't much. There are 5 quizzes and an accumulative final exam/essay.

You have to complete 4 discussion posts in total, and he let's you choose from different weekly ones.
