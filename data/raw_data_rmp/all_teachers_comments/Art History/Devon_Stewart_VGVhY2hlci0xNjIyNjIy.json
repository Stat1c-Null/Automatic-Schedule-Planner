I took notes a few times on unfamiliar topics and studied the vocab, got an easy A. Love this woman, very cute and funny! :)","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzE0Nzg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2011-12-03 05:08:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"I this class was stupid. I learned nothing. Her powerpoints are verbatim the book. Her tests are irrevelant to what is discussed in class.  If you do end up with this class, do not waste your time by going.  Seriously, do not take this class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzY4OTc4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2011-11-29 11:00:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would not recommend taking this class unless its your last resort. Professor Stuart does not answer emails. Her tests are very tricky and she messes up at least one question every test. She reads verbatim from pre-made powerpoints that are extremely long. A general education class should not require this much memorization or time.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzI4Mzg1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2011-11-27 22:23:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super sweet and funny. She's a very optimistic person, and I don't think I've ever seen her frown. You can tell she genuinely loves what she teaches, which is always good. Unfortunately, if you don't care about art, you are going to despise the class. Extremely boring AND difficult memorization. If you like art, take her. If not, use discretion.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzE3Njcy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARH2750","date_posted":"2011-11-10 21:41:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"I LOVE Prof. Stewart, she's hilarious and so nice. It's true that you do need to memorize stuff for her tests but really, it's not that hard to do with flashcards. Just be sure to know a balance between the ID info on the art and also the history surrounding it. The book is nice but really not necessary if you pay attention and take notes in class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjEzMjQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARH2750","date_posted":"2011-11-06 10:06:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class consisted of extremely hard memorization, so be prepared to make note cards. A few writing assignments diluted the test grades so it wasn't so bad. She is a very fun and interesting professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTcwMzg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
