Mainly short discussions posts where it is mandatory to reply after doing a reading on a chapter and listening to a virtual lecture. Very simple class and very literature comprehensive!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTI1MTYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Arh2750","date_posted":"2025-02-08 01:19:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"This prof makes the content interesting even despite it being a lot of information to take in.

You have to submit a hand-drawn sketch with analysis weekly. Plenty of extra credit opportunities. The textbook was necessary for homework, online being the cheapest. Within the semester, there are three essays, each fairly easy. Very understanding about absences, just email her. \n\n\n","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjgyOTk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Arh2750","date_posted":"2024-12-12 16:09:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Vause knows exactly what she's teaching and overall gives helpful feedback.

No quizzes or tests, but weekly journal entries from the textbook. There was one writing assignment that spanned the semester.

Lectures are very interesting and there are no tests. Dr. Vause is an excellent professor and genuinely cares about each student's success. If you need art history credits, take her classes!
