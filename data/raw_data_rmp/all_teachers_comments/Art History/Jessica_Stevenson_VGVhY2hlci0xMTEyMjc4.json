Attendance is checked and every class is a lecture so it makes sense to show up. She makes the lectures interesting, and enjoyed her class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDYzNzk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2010-12-08 00:04:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"it's sad that these people didn't even know her name is spelled &quot;stephenson.&quot; check under that name for more ratings.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODgyNjE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1101","date_posted":"2010-06-30 21:53:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not worth your tuition dollars. this is more about how to talk like an art snob than anything doing with art appreciation.

She has a very strong accent. The class is so large that it is difficult for her to get to know her students personally, so this class is very formal. In order to do well, you need to go to class, get the notes, and have a thorough understanding of the material.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MTg2MzE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
