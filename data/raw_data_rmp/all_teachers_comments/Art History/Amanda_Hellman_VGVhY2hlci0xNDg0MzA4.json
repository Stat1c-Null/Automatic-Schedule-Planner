She loves what she teaches, which means you will learn a lot and she's really nice and helpful! My major doesn't require more art classes but she's great and I highly recommend her!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTAwNDA4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARH2750","date_posted":"2011-05-17 17:29:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the WORST took her for Art History. Tests are extreeeeemely hard, not very clear at all. the tests are of power point picture and she asks crazy question you would NOT have any idea about. how does 60% of the class fail&#63;&#63; dont take her.... horrible teaching.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjIwNjQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARH2750","date_posted":"2011-05-03 10:24:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"i LOVE art. However, she seems to teach this class like it is a high level class.  2 exams, 2 quizzes, one extra credit opportunity.  You need to go to class to pass!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTEzODk5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2011-05-01 00:18:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"you do not need to buy the book or even attend class, however it helps. She posts all the information you need for the two exams. There is a midterm and final and 3 other grades that are simply going to a theater, music, and art event. Those are the only grades so they are weighted a lot but easy easy easy. Extra credit too!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTAwMDky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2011-03-26 00:38:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had to drop this class because she was so incredibly boring. She talks LITERALLY the entire class period. I had no idea what to study for and couldn't stand going to class after about three weeks. Attendance isn't mandatory and DON'T BUY THE BOOK. She uses powerpoints the whole time.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzE0NDYw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2010-10-18 12:51:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class is very boring. Attendance is not mandatory but some test questions you will only know from coming to class. She says all the material to know for tests is online but she adds other questions,too. Tests are on powerpoint so everyone has to go at the same pace. I studied very well and still barely passed. I DO NOT recommend this class!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjY2NDM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
