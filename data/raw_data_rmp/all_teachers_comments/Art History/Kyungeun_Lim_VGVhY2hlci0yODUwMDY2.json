The projects were easy too. She has good guest speakers and her activities are fun. I feel like I learned a lot. I am taking her again next semester and I am looking forward to it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODYyODU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Online Savvy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2023-03-22 18:05:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Posting this since she doesn't have many reviews yet. Professor Lim is very kind and I'm enjoying her class! We have 15 modules with three tests, and have to respond to 5 discussion posts for classwork credit. We have one final paper for a museum visit. She gives great feedback and lots of good information for our tests. Would take again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTI4ODE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2023-01-10 18:30:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is really nice and she has an accent. She lectures all class, but her lectures are really boring.. Tests are online and there's lots of reading material but they're not hard. Good class for makeup work in other classes. She grades really easy and wants you to do good. Not an interesting class unless you truly like art history, but an easy A.
