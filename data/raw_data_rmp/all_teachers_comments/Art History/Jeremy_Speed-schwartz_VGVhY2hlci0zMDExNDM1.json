He has the kindest nature I've ever come across in an educator, and despite his demeanor, he is so very social and has an endless wealth of knowledge on animation and networking. If you simply do your best to animate what he asks of you, you're golden. It's hard to wanted to disrespect him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODAxNjA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3600","date_posted":"2024-05-07 21:17:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Schwartz for Foundation Animation and he was absolutely wonderful. He did keep critique a little too nice for me at the beginning but if you need help understanding motion concepts, he is very eager to help. He has a nice balance of guiding students while also giving them independence. He was one of the best professors I've had in a while.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mzk1ODcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
