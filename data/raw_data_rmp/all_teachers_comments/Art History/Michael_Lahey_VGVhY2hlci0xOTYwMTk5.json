But if you aren't willing to put in your best effort for these classes, you may as well change majors/fields now and save yourself the time and pain. The UI/UX industry is ROUGH and if you can't handle his class, you won't make it in the real job world.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTY5NzE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IAD3000","date_posted":"2024-01-08 16:25:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lahey was, has been, and will always be my favorite professor. If you are an IAD major, then he is your life line. He genuinely cares about students and is very passionate about what he teaches. He is extremely supportive. His class is tough, but if you try hard and care about the course, you will do just fine.

He's very funny, realistic, and offered a sense of what the 'real world' is like outside of college. One of the few professors that gave constructive criticism on creative projects, which was a welcome break. Class with him always felt refreshing, down to earth, and fun.
