A few discussions to do, three tests, and a museum analysis over one piece. Pretty simple stuff just don't let it pile up on you or you will be swamped. Trust me.

The only thing you need to pay attention to is the deadline of assignements because there will be no make up opportunities. She will respond to your email, but sometimes it will take a long time for her to do. Tests were on Cengage and no lockdown browser or camera.

All of the Hw was on cengage. She gives 10ish discussion posts (1 per week) but only grades 4 so u can choose which one you want to do. I think they are also graded on completion but don't quote me. She gives one museum analysis and 3 tests which werent hard at all.

The only thing is that she rarely responds to emails. If you turn in late work or miss an exam she will put a zero because \"she has too many students to go back\", So make sure to read all deadlines. She makes mistakes on grade book so check your grades daily.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTI1MzIw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2024-10-19 16:49:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher is pretty easy. At first in assignments I found the work complicated to understand however, overtime, it became easier to understand. Class is an easy A but be prepared to do discussion posts and go through the videos and practice questions. If you need any assistance or understanding she does respond back 10/10 take her.
