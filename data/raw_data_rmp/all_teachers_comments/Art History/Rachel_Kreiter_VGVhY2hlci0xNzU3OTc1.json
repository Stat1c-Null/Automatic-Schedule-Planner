To be fair though, many of the students in the class I took were immature freshman with attitudes.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTU5OTEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2012-12-04 21:51:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Probably the worst teacher I've ever had in my life. She's NYU educated and yet doesn't know a thing about what she's teaching, completely useless and rude. Not helpful when you ask questions and snaps at you when you give her an opinion.

She is completely unclear about the material she wants to to study. Going to her class is DREADFUL. She is uninteresting, monotone, and rude to students. She doesn't know what she's talking about half the time. I would NEVER recommend her. EVER. HORRIBLE professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTUxODU0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2012-10-26 14:46:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not really clear on what to study.
