He really tries to give you the most out of the class, so he shares his personal experiences, as well as some insight into the materials. You REALLY need to attend his class to pass.

I haven't taken an art class since elementary school, nor do I have any interest in art. He KNOWS how to teach. Very smart and caring. IF YOU DO NOT SHOW UP YOU WILL FAIL. He doesn't post his slides, The class is 50min,just go. Take his lessons at face value, he isn't trying to trick you. Got a 98.

Its an EASY B and the A isn't hard to attain either. Attendance isn't necessary, that is unless you want an A. Come to class, take notes, study, (same as all other college classes) and its easy.
