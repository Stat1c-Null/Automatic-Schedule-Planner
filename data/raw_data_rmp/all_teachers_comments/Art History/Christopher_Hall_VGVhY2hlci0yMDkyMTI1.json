He doesn't clearly state online what forms to print for each project. The instructions he gives are not clear. I don't really feel like I'm learning in this class, it's almost like the students are teaching each other.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDUxODI3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1150","date_posted":"2018-04-03 13:58:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"He often canceled class without much notice whatsoever, which was quite a pain for those who live outside of the metropolitan area. He has a decent teaching style, but nothing too different or nuanced. Not very good at critique either, class critiques were unhelpful because he only ever talked about good students' artwork.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NzM0MDc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2018-03-13 16:34:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Prof. He only lectures from powerpoint and his powerpoints are straight from the chapter in the text. He is easy to follow and his grades are only from 4 tests (which are easy). As long as you study the material you will pass. You'll also have a project that requires you to go to a museum but it is easy stuff. Highly recommend!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjQ5MjYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1150","date_posted":"2017-10-25 17:18:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Expects a lot out of a class full of freshman. When he is disappointed with a class he chooses to share his distaste with other classes. Can be helpful but definitely make sure you have friends who will stick with you during class. Assignments can be hard but occasionally he will change the schedule if several people are having a hard time.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NzgzODQ0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2017-05-20 09:52:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Hall was a great professor for Art in Society. Powerpoint is his method of teaching but he actually knows his material to keep you engaged. His slide count averages from 60-90. You have to be there in order to know what slides you will need to memorizes for the test. There were 4 tests(in class) total and 2 HW assign. w/ 1 in class assignment.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzUyNTYz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Skip class?
