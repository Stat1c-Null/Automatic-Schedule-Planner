All the due dates were laid out at the beginning of the semester so we knew when to work on things. Just complete the assignments and do the non-lockdown tests and you will be fine.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODcyMjI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE3153","date_posted":"2017-12-07 18:30:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"He always resopnds back to students in a quick fashion. I understood his instructions very well. He has very keen attention to detail when grading assingments, or labs, but overall fair grader. Will help whenever needed. Everything that is read in the text-book is what is tested. Very nice online class. I learned a ton.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDg2ODI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Would take again","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
