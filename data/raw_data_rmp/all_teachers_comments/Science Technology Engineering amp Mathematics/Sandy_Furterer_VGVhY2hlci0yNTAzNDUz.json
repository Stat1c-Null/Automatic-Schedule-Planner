While trying to demonstrate problems live she struggled and then gave up. The &quot;lectures&quot; were problems scribbled on yellow legal pad or done in MS paint. Any learning accomplished in this class was accomplished solely by the students with zero assistance from the professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTkwODU5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"QA6602","date_posted":"2019-06-29 21:29:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Furterer is a professional and over-achiever; however, she treats this intro class as advanced course. Don't really teach much but grade you like you should know material well (but she forgot that not everyone is the same major, that's why we need this intro class). She maybe is knowledgeable enough but definite not a teaching material.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMDY3NTU3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
