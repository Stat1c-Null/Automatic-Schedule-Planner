Weekly quizzes (unlimited attempts, score is based on average of attempts), gave two attempts for the Cyberbit labs and 3 exams. Pretty straightforward class besides the rocky start.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjczMDYw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISA3210","date_posted":"2024-10-12 00:53:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great at communication and available on teams, however the lab environment did not become available until nearly 2 months into the semester.
