Took forever to respond to emails and would forget to upload things occasionally. She got the job done but I'd find another professor for this class if possible.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MTE3Nzgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2024-01-10 15:08:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Run if you see this woman's name. The worst professor I have ever had. She never responded to emails and when she did it was always with attitude and hate. She never taught anything, the work she gave us was simple but if you become confused with anything don't expect any help from her. She waits to grade until the day grades are due.

If you want to learn anything at all, do not take her. She does not respond to emails and she posts completely incorrect information about everything in the course. We had to contact another professor for correct info. Everything we learned was on our own.
