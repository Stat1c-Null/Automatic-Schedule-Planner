I will say her accent is sometimes hard to understand. There were times where it felt like she didn't know what she was talking about and a lot of times students were confused. I didn't learn a lot from her like I wish I would have. The assignments were easy but beware of the disposition diary.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NDMwOTYy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Gives good feedback--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED4483","date_posted":"2021-12-24 16:19:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is okay. What bothered me the most is that she doesn't respond to her emails at all so if you need to talk to her via email, she won't respond. She is hard to reach but the best way to talk to her is before/after class on campus. Lots of work and she is a tough grader. Make sure you follow the rubric and do everything on time and in detailed.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjQ5MTYz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"INED4482","date_posted":"2021-05-11 15:06:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall a good choice in a professor.

She is hard to understand online because of her accent &amp; technical issues. She is constantly changing her criteria for the assignments so at times this could make them very confusing.

She is incredibly hard to understand and every sentence includes the word um or uh. Directions are not clear at all and she does not provide feedback.
