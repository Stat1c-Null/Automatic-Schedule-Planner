The layout of the course was challenging, she did not like my worldview and provided little constructive feedback, she provided little to no rubrics or exemplars, which was disappointing. Take another instructor.

I'm not sure why these other reviews are saying that she doesn't give good, clear feedback when it has been all I've gotten. The only \"low\" grade I've gotten was because I forgot to respond to classmates' discussion posts one week. I would definitely take this professor again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODQxMzk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDRS8100","date_posted":"2024-03-07 00:34:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"I agree with others that this professor is condescending in her feedback. She offers lots of feedback, but it's vastly different from other professors in the program. If you can take another professor for the course, go for it.  I was warned not to take the class before this semester. I'm offering the same warning.
