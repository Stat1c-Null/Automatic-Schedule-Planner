She grades very loosely and the class runs at a slow, flexible pace.

The class layout and assignments are confusing as to when things are due or what her expectations are, but she is really easy going and clearly wants everyone to get an A. She is very laid back with the assignments and you do not have to do a lot of work to get 100s. There are readings weekly.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzAyODg3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2014-01-08 13:27:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her online and she was very helpful. She wasn't the best with returning emails, but she was a fast grader and allowed you to correct things you were unclear on. The class itself was pretty boring, but overall it was easy. I made an A in her class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzE4NzEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2013-10-23 11:28:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you like being treated like a 5th grader, this class is for you. The work is easy, but I'm rather insulted by the condescending tone she uses with her students. Lots of online work but everything is discussed in class. She always encourages questions and will help you out no sweat.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjA1NzYz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDCU2120","date_posted":"2013-04-23 23:37:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed this class and the way she had the online modules set up. It is a lot of work that you have to keep up with because it's online but it is manageable. If you follow directions it's possible to get a 100 on every assignment. She gives you a lot of feedback which you don't get much online. I would loveto take her in person!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTkxMzY4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
