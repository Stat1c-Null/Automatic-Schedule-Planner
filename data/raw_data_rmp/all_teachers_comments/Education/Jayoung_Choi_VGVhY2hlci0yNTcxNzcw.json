Make sure to purchase both textbooks because you will definitely use them throughout the semester. You can tell she is very passionate about what she does. There was only a 22 point difference between an A and a B so make sure you work hard on those disposition diaries. They are worth a lot.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTM4MTA4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"INED4483","date_posted":"2020-04-27 13:43:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Choi is very caring and does the best she can for her students.

I'm not sure why there are no reviews yet! I would definitely take her, she is the best out of all ESOL teachers for INED 4483. She is caring and does not overload us with work, and she is flexible with grades and deadlines. She really wants to help us out!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTkxODYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
