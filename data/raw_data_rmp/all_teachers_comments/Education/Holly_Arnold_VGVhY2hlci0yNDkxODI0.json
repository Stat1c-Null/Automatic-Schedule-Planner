A required textbook is needed, but it was informative and would be useful for teaching any level of class. The weekly assignments were clear, with instructional support modules and the grading was prompt with useful feedback. There was a lengthy lesson plan assignment in the final weeks of class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTI3NTU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED4482","date_posted":"2022-01-03 22:07:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this class and this professor! she is so sweet and funny. The lectures in class were so interesting and she uses her own personal stories in the lectures which was cool. If you do the work she gives you, you'll pass.
