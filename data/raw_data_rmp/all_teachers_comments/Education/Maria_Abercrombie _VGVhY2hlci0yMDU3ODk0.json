Every assignment, test, or quiz we were given were created by someone else. The entire class was based off of someone else's instruction and we hardly went over any material in class. I could have made the same grade had I just spent my time at home reading the text. Very rude when giving feedback.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTU3NTA3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3350","date_posted":"2016-03-29 15:30:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"3350. It was alot of information on child development and theory but very essential in being a teacher. She was good at quick feedback and gave us real life examples to make the content stick. I don't think she was rude except to the one student that came in 30-60 minutes late each week and then asked questions because SHE was confused.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTk4NDMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3350","date_posted":"2016-01-12 19:20:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not walk, but RUN from Abercrombie. By far the worst professor I have ever had. She is incredibly rude and won't answer your questions she'll just e-mail \"I already told you in class\" as an answer. I got an A in her class, but it was all thanks to my own research and other professors who helped. She is worthless, I will NEVER take her again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTI5MjI3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3350","date_posted":"2015-11-04 13:21:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"She assigned us 4 different 4-page papers with very unclear direction and she didn't want to answer questions or help and they were all due within a week of each other. She is very rude and doesn't like to help you. I will never take or reccomend this professor to anyone. I don't know what I've learned and I dread going to her class.
