She is the best professor and really cares about her students. She goes a little fast through the PowerPoints, but she loves the topics she is talking about and is so passionate about teaching students how to take care of English Language Learners. Please take her she is amazing!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjQ0OTAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Participation matters--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
