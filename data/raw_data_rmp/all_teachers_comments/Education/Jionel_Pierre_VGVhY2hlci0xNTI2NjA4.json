I enjoyed his class.  He has practical teaching methods.  He gets rid of the fluff and tells you exactly how it is in the field. I learned so much from him and I wish he taught other subjects!

The topics discussed are so polarizing and you can pretty much guess which way he leans by the way he presents them. However, I did get along with him even though we disagreed on things. He is helpful and I would recommend him to anyone!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NzY1NzA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2011-05-07 00:05:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Initially I butted heads a lot with this professor, but I learned more in this class about myself and as a future educator than any other class I've taken at KSU. He pushes you out of your comfort zone, and challenges you to think. He really does care about his students, and respects others opinions. I would highly recommend him.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTQ2NjY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2011-05-06 11:54:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loved the professor, hated the students! I wish I could have chosen who could register for the class. Who you take a class with makes a big difference.
