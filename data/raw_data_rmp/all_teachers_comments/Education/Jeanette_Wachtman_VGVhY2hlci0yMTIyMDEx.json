She offers a lot of extra credit. There are 3 exams which can be difficult if you didn't take the time to study the material in the book. I recommend that you save the powerpoints each week since the module closes at the end of the week.

You will learn a lot about art. I had a lot of fun completing the art projects for this course. Only negative is there is a lot of assignments for a 2 credit hour class.

There are 2 video assignments and you will need the textbook.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODU1NDQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Inspirational--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARED3309","date_posted":"2018-05-03 13:25:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class seems like a lot of busy work.
