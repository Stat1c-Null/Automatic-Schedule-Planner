Projects she does not just give you an A if you do it, but if you put in effort and follow rubrics then you can get an A. She is very clear about what Is expected and very helpful always. She really cares about the students and I would take her again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NzUzODg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDSM2010","date_posted":"2015-12-13 16:24:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Such a sweet lady. The class was so boring and lectures were so long (she just reads from her powerpoint) but she is so willing to help her students succeed. Tests come straight from the powerpoint and are SO EASY. A couple projects that are super simple, too. She loves discussions, so as long as you show up and do what you're expected...A+!
