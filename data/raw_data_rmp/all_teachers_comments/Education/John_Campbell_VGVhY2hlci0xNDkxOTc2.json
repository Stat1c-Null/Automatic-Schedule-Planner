If you have any interest in becoming a teacher you should take him. His assignments are not too difficult, and he responds to all your questions if you ask in class. There is a group presentaion at the end, but to is not too demanding.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTUwNTEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2011-08-19 11:59:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Reminded me of hanging out with my grandpa.  In all seriousness, this class will be a joke.  I say this because I am writing the review before the close of the first class.  Need an easy A&#63;  Take this course from this professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4OTMzMjU4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2011-05-19 15:18:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"I'll level with you here. Take this class but be prepared. Maybe the easiest A in history. Lectures teach you nothing of value, assignments are all done online (if you do it wrong he lets you try again and if it's late he still will give you 100), and I spent the class updating Facebook with the inane comments he would make. Weirdest class ever.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjM0NzIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2011-03-26 00:37:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS I HAVE EVER HAD. HE IS AN OLDER TEACHER, BUT IS OVERLY HELPFUL, QUICK TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS, QUICK TO GRADE WORK, AND HIS LECTURES ARE VERY FUNNY. HE RELATES MATERIAL TO REAL LIFE AND MAKES HIS STUDENTS HIS FIRST PRIORITY. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR! TAKE NOT ONLY FOR THE GRADE BUT FOR THE EXPERIENCE!!!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzE0NDU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
