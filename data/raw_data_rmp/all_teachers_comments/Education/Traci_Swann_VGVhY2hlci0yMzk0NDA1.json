Didn't unlock modules on time and then expected work to be completed with ridiculous templates. For a class that focuses on gifted student instruction, the assignments in this class didn't teach the basics. Just busy work.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4Mjk2Mzc2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED7768","date_posted":"2023-07-19 11:34:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Practically non-existent as a professor. The work was given in modules, completed by students, and never graded until the very last week of school. Gave the vibe of expensive busy work. As a student, you will get out of it what you put into the reading and research, as the professor is in name only.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTExMDg4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED7768","date_posted":"2023-07-17 23:14:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is my third semester of taking her in grad school, and she got better over time. Trick is to be very friendly and professional in emails. She does not grade until the end of the semester, but overall is a good grader. The assignments can be confusing so ask for clarification through text (she does not respond fast to emails).

As a first year teacher in a grad school program, I wanted to work ahead, but she refused to open modules early for me. She said she was fine, so I would be fine. She also never graded in a timely manner, so I never knew how I was doing in the class.
