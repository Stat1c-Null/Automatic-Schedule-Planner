She let everyone have their own time to speak and get to know the people in the class, even if it was awkward.

This entire semester was just up in the air the entire time and nothing was ever clear. She does not give instructions and never grades anything. We've had about 13 quizzes and none of them have been graded. She never answers emails either.

I have only received three grades for the whole semester and it is very disappointing due to the time and effort I have put into assignments. It seems she does not put grades in till the last week.

There was an immense amount of panic and frustration due to her lack of communication. She was in another country for a majority of the class and did not start to enter grades until the day before final grades were due.

We were assigned a million readings for quizzes that she would post online a day or so before they were due, which made them hard to get around to sometimes.
