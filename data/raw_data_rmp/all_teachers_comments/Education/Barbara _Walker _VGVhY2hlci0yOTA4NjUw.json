The assignments are pretty much all essays and presentations but they are not terrible. Attendance is not mandatory but she does have random attendance days. She is super sweet but does go off topic to tell stories about her life. I recommend taking her.

She grades well to the rubric and as long as you are putting in the effort, you will be heavily rewarded. She allows for clear discussion and is overall a very sweet person. 10/10 would do EDUC 2120 with her multiple times again!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjU1MjAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"11418","date_posted":"2023-12-12 17:27:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the most amazing professor I have ever had. She does do participation grades, 10 the whole semester to be exact. Other than that she is always fun to be around, like it won't feel like a chore to come to her class. She makes you work together a lot which in the long run made us all become friends. Definitely recommend her!!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjI5MzI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"11418","date_posted":"2023-12-03 21:39:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Walker was an incredible professor.

She has that Southern hospitality and is very caring and gives off mothering vibes. She is very silly, she's a bit older so she just says funny stuff without even knowing. She is a very entertaining professor and is not difficult at all very easy class, one of my easiest class this semester. 100% take this!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4Mjc3OTA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"11418","date_posted":"2023-05-11 17:00:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Walker is awesome. Admittedly, some of the instructions to the assignments she gives are a little bit confusing, but if you just ask her either in person or via email, she will give a better understanding of them. If you put in the effort and go to class you can get an easy 100. She is by far one of the best teachers I have had at KSU.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODk4MDQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
