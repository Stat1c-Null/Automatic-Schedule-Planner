Lots of weekly reading and tons of busy work that isn't beneficial at all. She's accessible outside of class but not always helpful with her answers. Almost everything we did felt pointless/like busy work. For an online class, it was quite time consuming. Big workload.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODkwMDg1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2024-06-08 19:13:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was my favorite professor throughout the entire program, HANDS DOWN! Honestly, If you do your reading and take a couple notes (they're graded for completion not accuracy) and show up to class. That's the bulk of your grade right there. If you can, I recommend taking her for both 3320 and 3330. You won't regret it.

Completing readings and attending class ensures easy points. Sanders ends each session with a book, seen by some as \"patronizing,\" but it's a delightful way to conclude class and suggest useful children's books.
