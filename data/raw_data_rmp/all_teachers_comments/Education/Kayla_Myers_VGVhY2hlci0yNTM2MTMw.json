The discussion boards were broken down into small groups so you could actually read the other 3-4 students responses and have a discussion. I also appreciated that she was quick to respond to any questions and she gives you choices on how to exhibit your learning.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzIwMDcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4408","date_posted":"2020-05-03 13:44:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Myers was my professor through the COVID pandemic and she is amazing. She was great beforehand, but she made the transition super easy for us and every week she made sure we were okay and not just doing our work.

While all my other professors thought this was the perfect time to increase the workload, Dr. Myers not only made life incredibly easy on us, she took the time to individually call us on Zoom to do a check in on us personally and academically. I cannot say enough good things about her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTczMTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MAED3316","date_posted":"2020-04-23 14:56:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"This semester we obviously were affected by the virus so we had to switch to online for half of the semester. Both in class and online Professor Myers was great! She has such a sweet personality. She doesn't really teach and just gives worksheets to work on with classmates that are pretty simple with a partner.
