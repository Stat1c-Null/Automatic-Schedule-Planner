As a future educator, I am ashamed that Kennesaw State would allow a course like this.  The course was a never-ending list of ridiculously hard assignments with no \"teaching\" involved at all. No online lectures, no useful resources. Very hypocritical in a course on differentiated instruction.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMzU0NzQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2013-08-20 15:20:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take her! Dr. Heckert is so wonderful! Her online class was daunting at first but after a week or 2, it becomes clearer. A lot of work, nothing too difficult, just make sure you keep up and it won't seem so bad. She gives GREAT info and resources I will definitely use in my classroom. She also really reads your work and gives thoughtful feedback.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMDY5NzM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2013-08-19 11:37:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely amazing professor.
