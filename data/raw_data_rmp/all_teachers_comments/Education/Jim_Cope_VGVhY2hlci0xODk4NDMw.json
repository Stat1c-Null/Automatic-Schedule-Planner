Beware if you hate discussion groups but he does a great job of making his students understand the literature. He does grade papers a little harsher but you always get the grade you deserve.

Easiest English class I've taken so far. Only a few papers through the semester and a small discussion every week. One proctored exam. Couldn't ask for a more straightforward, laid back professor.

He really cares about his students and is really helpful. We had group projects and I like how we use discussion in a group. He is a fair grader but it's hard to make a 100. I've only just made above 90's but I'm fine with that. I wish I could take him for all of my education classes!

Assingments are due weekly on the same day. There are about 4 group projects, but as long as you communicate well with your assign group, you will do fine. He communicates well.
