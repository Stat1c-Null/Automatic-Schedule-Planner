He is very passionate about what he teaches, and is respectful of his students. Having said this, attendance is mandatory and if u skip a lot then you likely will not pass the class. Overall a great class, and an easy A if you show up","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDQ3MDQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

He is very redundant in his class lectures. We were assigned a group project, 2 in class presentations , and a lot of mini essays. Midterm and final can be a bit tricky if you don't consistently take notes. He is a very sweet man but the class is just really boring.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODIxOTA1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2017-12-06 15:45:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a wonderful professor that knows what he is talking about. Make sure you pay attention to his lectures or you won't pass his midterm or final. Both tests are short answer. Also, speak up in his class. He encourages class discussions and loves to hear other people's opinion. The more you speak, the better your participation grade will be.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDY2MTg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2016-05-20 22:21:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"There is a one page response for every chapter read in the book. The only tests are the midterm and final. There is a required 15 hours of VKSU to complete and then he makes you do a presentation on what it was like. Only negative thing about him is that he tended to change instructions/rubric after (or day before) the assignment was due","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NjI3Mjgx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2015-03-18 23:35:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's so nice, but his lectures are booooring. Just stands and talks (no visual) and its so easy to tune him out. Pay attention though! He likes to call on you for your opinion. Group project is easy (with a good group) and the volunteer hours are too, just get them done quick. 1 page response paper for almost every class, just skim the chapter!

Assigns a lot of response papers but they're only one page long each and he's an easy grader, got an A on almost all papers. Group project is a little tough but if you have any questions on what to do he's happy to help. Lectures are fun and above all he keeps you interested.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzc5MjMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
