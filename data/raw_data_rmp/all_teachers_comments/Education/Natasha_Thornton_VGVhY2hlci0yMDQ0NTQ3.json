Most other classes dropped a few assignments because it is too much to do while doing clinicals. She is passionate about cultural relevance, but I did not learn anything new in this class. She does not respond to emails. I have gotten a good grade, but it just did not enjoy this class. She grades harshly too.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNTY0NjI0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?
