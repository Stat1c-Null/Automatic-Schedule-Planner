However, tests are EASY. Study your guide and you'll make a 100.

He tells tons of stories from the past about teaching. I looked forward to his class. The lectures ran long but his class was enjoyable. I would take him for every education class if I could. He's there for you and will help you as much as he can. Will let you redo work if you didn't do it right the first time.

He is very un-organized and just talks the whole class from poorly made slides. If you ask for help he gives it but not very clearly, we have changed dates for assignments and pushed them back by a month.

He is engaged and interested in everything he teaches so he is easy to follow. I took a hybrid class and as long as you go to class and contribute to the discussions you'll make an A.

Hardly use book but you'll need it to help write your paper (which is so easy and I hate papers) and for the open book/open note final. He is crazy unorganized but a nice man.
