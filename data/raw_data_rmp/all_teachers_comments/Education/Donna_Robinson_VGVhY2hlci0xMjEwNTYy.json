She was hypocritical in her grading, and unclear on what she wanted within an assignment. Her grading scale is based off of if she thinks someone wrote better than you, she docks points, and not the rubric that is given.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjU3Mjk2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2023-12-12 17:49:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class still continues to be as similar as 10 years ago. Before our class confronted her on her wrongdoings for grading, she all graded us toughly on opinion based writing. She has mentioned quite passive-aggressive statements during her time in the classroom with us to the point where one student has reported her. She doesn't take responsible.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjI5NzQy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2023-12-07 18:37:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"I have nothing good to say about this professor. She made inappropriate jokes about students and told them they would have a hard time getting a job in class. She seems like she grades based off whether she likes what you wrote.

Wouldn't suggest this class to anyone.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTU4Nzc0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2023-12-06 16:27:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was the most unorganized class I have ever experienced. I know she was trying, but the whole semester was rough. The grading criteria is weird and even if something is subjective, she will mark it wrong.

She states that she grades papers and assignments based on the quality of other students work in the class. She will say awful things about students, thinking it's a joke, in front of the class. She does not have clear rubrics, and when she does, she doesn't follow them. She berates students and targets them.

For a hybrid class that is online a lot she has no idea how to use D2L. She is terribly spoken, always loses her train of thought, & hard to follow.

I hate going to class, and everyday have a new complaint about her methods.  For someone who is supposed to be teaching future educators, she shows them everything they shouldn't do.
