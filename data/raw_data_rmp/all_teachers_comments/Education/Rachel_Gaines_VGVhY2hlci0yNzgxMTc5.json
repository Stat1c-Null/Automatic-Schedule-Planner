Not a heavy course load, and well-paced. Instructor is flexible on group discussion and participation and open to students. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTY1MjY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
