She is by far the worst professor I have had. All of her lectures are pointless and she never knows what she is talking about. Most of the information she tried to teach us contradicted everything we have learned in our other classes. She is not clear about any of our projects and is no help if you are confused.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NjI2ODY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE2205","date_posted":"2005-12-19 17:34:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing this woman is still around.  Very unprofessional- she only teaches 2 classes during the entire semester- the rest are taught by the class. She's too lazy to do anything, which is why her students end up teaching. Observations are a WASTE OF TIME, as is the entire class.
