Dr. Simpson does not communicate well and often takes days to respond to emails or simple questions. Dr. Simpson also give very confusing feedback that contradicts instructions in her course.  Dr. Simpson in total does very little to help you if you are confused.

There are discussion posts, Field Experience labs, and a group project. You will need 15 hrs of field experience, but it is all online. She always says you need to read, but you can get away with never reading the textbook chapters.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjM4Njk2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC7700","date_posted":"2021-12-19 15:15:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Simpson is the worst professor that I have had. Dr. Simpson wasn't organized and made navigating her course confusing. Dr. Simpson was not a good communicator via D2L, email, or teams. She would bury important information in long emails that was easy to miss and would take up to a week to answer questions about important assignments via email.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTk2NjYy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDMG3350","date_posted":"2013-11-11 15:41:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Simpson was amazing. I took her over summer and there was a ton of content that she delivered very well and very clearly. She's patient and really wants to see you succeed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMjkzMTMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
