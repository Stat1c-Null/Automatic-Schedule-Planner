He was a very knowledgeable teacher who presented unique perspectives to culture from years of living abroad. BUT, anyone not willing to work+learn will not enjoy his class. As a man, he is one of the most inspirational people I know, and often goes out of his way to help+mentor his students","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzMwOTE2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2013-05-06 10:05:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"PAINFUL. He knows what he is talking about, but can't convey the information to his students. VERY awkward class. He expects everyone to \"critically read\" each chapter and no one ever does, so there is nothing to discuss. He just talks the whole time. I kind of felt sorry for him. Very nice guy, but grading is harsh and he can make you feel dumb.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjg0MDU5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2012-12-19 11:53:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Meyjes is a terrible professor. He does not know how to teach and his class is extremely painful. However, if you can deal with his annoying behavior and the ridiculousness of the class then you will probably end up with an A. Just be warned about the annoyances to come.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTI0MDAw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2012-12-10 13:59:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Meyjes is a very knowledgable professor, but he is very hard to approach.

His instructions are vague and he often changes his assignments last minute.  He has an extremely \"meta\" type of outlook and often teaches outside of the textbook.  He teaches an undergraduate class as if it were on a doctorate level.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTA5NDEw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2012-11-26 17:02:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is the worst teacher that i've ever had. I can barely understand his accent. Everyone in class is always complaining about not being able to pay attention because he is so boring. He expects doctorate level work for a entry level class. No other teacher alive grades papers as harshly as he does. And when you ask for help, he is unclear/vague.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODg3ODUx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2012-07-13 12:42:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very knowledgeable about any education topic and will help you with everything if you just ask. He wants everyone to think past the book in order to become an effective teacher. Hands down the BEST professor I have had in the Education department! He will also take the time to help you with other courses if you need it.
