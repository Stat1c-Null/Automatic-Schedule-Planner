She would give broad answers &amp; treat u as if u r an inconvenience. Other than that, this class is BUSY work. Lots of assignments for 13 modules for the semester. I would say work hard &amp; u'll be fine. I made an A in the class cause I worked for it &amp; I know u will too!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTI5MDEz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Test heavy--So many papers","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"3304","date_posted":"2014-05-03 13:24:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She knows her stuff and gives you concrete examples of how best to work with students with disabilities. She communicates through weekly emails and always states in the instructions to email her through her Kennesaw account and not D2L- so not sure what that one review was talking about...guess they don't read what she sends out.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTU1MjM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED7720","date_posted":"2014-04-21 23:13:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"I enjoy Dr. Zimmer.  This is a tough but great course. If you manage your time and assignment, the course load is manageable. When I needed help she was very approachable and took the time to sit with me and help me understand the material that was confusing to me.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDczMTU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2014-02-16 12:10:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Zimmer's online class is a ton of work. I forgot to email her though her personal email and did through D2L and she didn't even answer me. She assigns 3 to 4 assignments a week. You also have discussions that you have to be involved in and reply to three times and on her schedule. Not impressed at all. Too much for an online class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyODQ0NTky","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2013-11-26 23:05:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Zimmer is very passionate/knowledgeable about Special Ed. That being said, her course load is almost completely unmanageable. She assigned 3-6 assignments a week not including a weekly discussion post. Assignments took many hours. Well meaning but it is way too much work/information for one course. I only used the textbook for her exams.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzk1MzYz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2013-11-22 12:11:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Zimmer is very smart and passionate about the field of special education.  She has taught elementary school for several years and has tons of great advice for classroom activities, management, and differentiation.  I would say the work load is average, with one massive lesson plan at the end 3 exams. She is super friendly and helpful.
