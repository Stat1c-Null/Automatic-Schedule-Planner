I took her for my first education class and she is amazing. She is so sweet and caring and makes sure that class is not just a boring lecture class. There is a lot of little activities that some count as classwork grades, but they are very easy and are just for participation. Great class","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTYwMjY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2018-12-03 16:30:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"super super nice and enthusiastic. easy A","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODQ4MDE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2017-04-22 09:35:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Gillis is the nicest lady you will ever meet.
