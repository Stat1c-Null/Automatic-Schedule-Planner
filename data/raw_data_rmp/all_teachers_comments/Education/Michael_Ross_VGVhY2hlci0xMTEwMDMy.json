He has tons of material online that is from prior semesters so it is unclear what the deadlines are.  He is constantly apologizing for incorrect or late material.  Otherwise, he is very lenient on deadlines.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4OTIxMjc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2011-05-13 23:48:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Ross is so amazing. I took his online educ 2120 and then I studied abroad with him for educ 2130 in London. He is such an amazing teacher, and he wants you to do well. He is very helpful.

Dr. Ross though is the most arrogant and rudest professor I have ever met. I would have rather taken a challenging class and had a respectful professor. However, EDUC2120 was only offered online-so I didn't have a choice. Avoid him if possible-if not-it's an Easy A.  Group projects were so-so.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTE3MzQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2011-01-08 22:52:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Online class: Ross gives you a second chance to get things right! I hate group projects but got through them-some nearly all on my own! You'll get an A if you do the work and make sure you get going on your group projects as soon as you can!

Class is fun and exciting.  Dr. Ross is hilarious and has years of expierence that he puts to good use.  One of the best classes I've taken at Kennesaw. Attendance is mandatory, but he gives you plenty of &quot;sick days&quot;.  No test.  Didnt use the book. Projects are easy.  You'll learn a lot.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NDIxOTQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
