She does not know how to operate her own class and ask us all the time when things are due. She is a really kind and caring person, but if I did not have hope to cover my tuition I would be extremely angry. We only meet once a month and all of her assignments are GROUP WORK.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTMzMDE5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
