Mrs. Ryann was always unprepared for class and struggle to answer student questions. She was rude and seemed mad that we even had questions in the first place.

She did not know what was going on in her own class, and when asked questions about it she was extremely rude to students who just had questions. Her class completely lacked structure and it made an already very stressful class even more overwhelming.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjI3NjQ3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE-4409","date_posted":"2024-04-22 17:18:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was honestly so overwhelming, the work load, the assignments and the structure of the class was quite ridiculous. It felt like she just didn't even know what was going on in her own class. The fact that this course is online just doesn't make sense to me. Every single class you will leave with more questions than you had arriving.
