Requires reading and 1 quiz a week, plus a lot of silly group discussion. To her benefit, 2120 is kind of a dumb class anyways so the material is common sense boring stuff. I personally would take someone else, but it's an easy A class for the most part and she's not awful.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDkzMTAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
