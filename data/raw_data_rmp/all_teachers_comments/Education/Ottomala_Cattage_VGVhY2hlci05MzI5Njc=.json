The actual class isn't hard, but her teaching SUCKS. I really don't know how she has a job at KSU. She's very negative... she always talks about suicide and depressing topics. It's really strange. I would NOT take here again!!

She's boring, only reads from powerpoints, and has a class activity almost every class; she doesn't know anyone by name, is very unclear as to what she wants for assignments, and  isn't willing to help much when asking questions.

She is such a sweet lady and has a great sense of humor. Her class is pretty easy. A few group assignments, a journal of &quot;field Exp&quot;, and a couple papers.

She didnt even teach, instead just read page by page from the text which is not really teaching. Gave study guides that were a waste and the test was not relevant to the nine packets of study guides.

All it consisted of was the class giving group presentations all semester - she only lectured maybe 3 or 4 out of 30 or so classes.
