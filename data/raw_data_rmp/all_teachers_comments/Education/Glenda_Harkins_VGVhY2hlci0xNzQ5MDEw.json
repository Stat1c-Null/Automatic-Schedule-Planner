In class she speaks to you like you're one of her middle school kids. She spend an hour talk about what we are doing today and 15 mins actually going over the information so basically she just reads the syllabus for an hour. She'll say \"I dont know bc I didnt make up this course\" daily.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNjUzMzEw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
