He can be unclear at times with assignments but he is more than happy to elaborate as much as needed so you know what he's looking for. He loves to lecture, I felt at times like I was in a high school class. Pretty easy though, I made an A in the class","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NTA0MzM5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3302","date_posted":"2009-12-08 14:00:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I learned a lot.  I don't think he was very clear with directions or expectations many times, but just ask, ask, ask. Not a difficult class, but you have to go to class and do the work.
