No test or quizzes, just lots of modules, five video assignments, one paper, and one PowerPoint project. Every assignment is given an in-depth rule brick, so as long as you follow it, youll get an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDEwODk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDMG3300","date_posted":"2019-06-30 15:46:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Gillis is BY FAR the best professor I have ever had. He cares about each one of his students and wants everyone to truly succeed in the long term. I have learned more from him in one class than 3 years of my education at KSU. The grade you get is really based on effort you put into this course. If you get the chance, TAKE HIM.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMDY4NDEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDSM3360","date_posted":"2019-05-23 18:49:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor.

He absolutely knows what he's talking about, and has an answer for almost any pedagogical question you have. He is NOT a tough grader, no idea why anyone would say he is. He's very clear about what he wants, and fairly lenient on deviation so long as you show comprehension of the topic.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTM1MzUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDRD4409","date_posted":"2018-04-27 16:04:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"His assignments are hard and he will not make it easy to get an A, but if you want to do good in his class you can.

There is no doubt in my mind I will be a better teacher because of him. He's not always easy, but he let's you redo your work to fix your mistakes and gives great feedback on assignments.

You can tell he just wants to make great teachers and to help his students grow.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTE1MTYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDRD4409","date_posted":"2018-04-17 22:26:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"We had to read a lot of books. You will have to learn by failure in his class, but he normally allows for some revisions on assignment. You can clearly tell he has favorites but he fairly grades everyone. He is very particular when grading and sometimes he poorly explains the assignments. Really hard to get an A.

His explanation of assignments are confusing at best. His directions often contradict his rubrics, and his feedback contradicts his directions. Appears to mean well, but seems to design his class as an obstruction to student success instead of a pathway toward achievement.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NTc2Mzk5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--Skip class?
