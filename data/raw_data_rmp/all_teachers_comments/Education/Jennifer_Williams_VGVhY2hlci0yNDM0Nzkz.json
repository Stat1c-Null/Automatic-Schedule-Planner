She was impossible to get a hold of and failed to grade in a timely fashion. There is a three part lesson plan group project, but she wouldn't grade in time to submit the next part. I would define this class as endless busywork.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjQ0NTcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"INED4431","date_posted":"2021-04-19 17:30:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"TERRIBLE Hard to get a hold of.

She can be very passive-aggressive. Large assignments, the open note take-home test took me about 9 hours to finish. Many of my classmates also spent about 7 hours on that assignment, which there are two in the semester. No quizzes. Discussion every week, along with an additional assignment.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzEyNTM4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"INED4435","date_posted":"2020-01-11 04:32:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"She really wants students to succeed in her class.
