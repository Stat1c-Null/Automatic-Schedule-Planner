She is a tough grader, make sure you follow the rubric or else she will take points of for every little thing. Class lectures are read from power points and there is not ever anytime to do assignments in class. SO MANY ASSIGNMENTS, some of them are easy A's if you get them turned in on time and signed by your CT.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODI4NTg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

She is always available and responds to emails fast. Cons are her classes are all lectures on an already narrated PowerPoint, while class time could be used more efficiently to get help doing the numerous projects. There are tons of projects.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDQzMjY2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECE3313","date_posted":"2017-11-08 10:06:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Quizzes are easy. Class is so boring- all she does is read from other people's Powerpoints, it's basically a 3 hour study hall so it's good to get other work done. There are so many assignments, but she gives good feedback. Only drawback is she's super picky about what she wants (even if you follow the rubrics) so you really have to work for an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU2OTAy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

Which is crazy, because it's preschool curriculum, but Dr. Bell organizes the class and its a lot. Doss is super sweet though. Definitely a good choice.

She gives amazing feedback and is genuinely a nice person. Took her for 3313 and i always recommend her. The class itself is ALOT of work, but that's with any professor. Doss makes the process a little easier because she's so sweet. She also gives extensive and helpful feed back.
