Class always felt like a waste of time and it felt like she always purposefully dragged it out the full three hours when it was not necessary at all. What we did in class could easily be done in an hour, and it was all group/busy work that was pointless.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODg5OTk5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4408","date_posted":"2024-05-04 20:38:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"I LOVE PROF WARD!!

Not allowed to use gradual release of responsibility in your lesson plan.

She asks every class how we are doing and how she can help. There is not many assignments, but they take a lot of work and time, and sometimes time is given in class.
