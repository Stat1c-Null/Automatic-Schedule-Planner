She came in middle of assignments that were given by the previous professor. However, she was a bit funky on grading. She wouldn't have clear grading criterion. And when she did it would be AFTER you turn in the assignments. She like to discuss book in class. Confusing classwork.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MjA5MDQ2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
