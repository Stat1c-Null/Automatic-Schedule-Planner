She barely responds to emails and if she does, they're grammatically incorrect and they don't actually answer the question. She grades last minute so you won't know your grade until the semester ends. Her instructions are unclear and she said we will have meetings every Thursday, but she only showed up once,","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDk5ODEw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2022-12-01 20:29:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Learned a lot. Lots of work but its in the syllabus use it as a guideline so you will do the module and then the assignments for that module.6 modules total. I would take her again online. She doesnt give feedback. And the FE labs and the FE Log (online observation videos) are different things she doesn't make that very clear. Also,1 group project.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTM4NDQ0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2022-08-15 14:30:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was alright, fun sometimes a great person, her class was all over the place. She hardly ever actually taught she just went off on tangents. She was very unclear nothing on D2L lined up with what she said. She was terrible at communicating with you. She never posted announcements you had to be in class if you wanted to make sure of due dates.
