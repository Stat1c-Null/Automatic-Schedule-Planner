I mean TERRIBLE! He doesn't take attendance and he is the definition of boring. I did all the work, showed up to class, paid attention when other people would just leave and he had the audacity to give me a bad letter grade.

Do not take this professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTM1OTM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2009-12-04 16:05:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher is awful.

Honestly, I think he is a wonderful teacher. He makes his students think beyond and get out of our &quot;teacher procedure&quot; role.  Sometimes his directions were a little unclear, but he always was willing to repeat himself or give examples. He is very approachable as well. I would take him again in a heartbeat.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MTA4MjI0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC33022204","date_posted":"2005-06-06 18:27:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Unclear is how I would describe Dr. Breault. He can take the most simple assignment and make it SO very hard to understand the directions! I have had him twice and he is all papers and participation. He is unorganized and impractical. Also, he has no confidence in himself which I found unfortunate. He is a nice person though.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Njg0NTE=","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2204","date_posted":"2005-01-05 19:32:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is all papers and group work.
