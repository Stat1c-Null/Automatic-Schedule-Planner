No tests except for the final. Weekly online quizzes. Classwork for a grade every class. If you go to class, it's an easy A. Definitely recommend! If I could take him again, I would.

He makes things very clear and even gives you a classwork grade, which is also practice from class as you go to make sure you understand the material! For not liking math, I loved going to his class and he helped me throughout the semester! Would deff take again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDQwMzgx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3390","date_posted":"2015-01-12 17:47:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love Dr. Lim!!! He is absolutely hilarious without even meaning to be. As long as you go to class and complete the assignments in class, as well as the three papers, you'll make an A or B. TAKE HIM!! Also, you don't have to buy a book, he puts everything from the books you need online.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Mjc1MDkw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH3395","date_posted":"2014-07-18 20:27:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lim is GREAT!!  Very interested in his students and is extremely helpful.  Encourages the class to work together for solutions.  Walks around the room after asking a question and will help individually if it looks like you are struggling.  Wish he taught more of the classes I need.  :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDU2MDU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2012-08-13 10:46:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lim is an awesome teacher. At first I was skeptical because of his thick Korean accent, but he is not hard to understand. He has a really funny sense of humor, lots of quizzes over vocabulary with no word bank so make sure you study. 3 papers, but they are very easy to write. Dr. Lim is very reasonable and understands his students have a life.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTY5NjEz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
