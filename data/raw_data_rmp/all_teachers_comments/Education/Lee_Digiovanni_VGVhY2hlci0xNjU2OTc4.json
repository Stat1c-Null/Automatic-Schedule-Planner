The instructions were very vague and confusing; they had to be clarified multiple times. Don't move ahead in the course if you are confused, she won't answer questions unless the module is open.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NjU5Mjcz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3302","date_posted":"2012-05-11 17:46:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. D is GREAT. Take her!! I learned a lot in this class, and it wasn't overly hard. She doesn't give busy work or boring assignments; most stuff is group work, so find a good group in the beginning and you should be good for the semester! Dr. D will make you feel comfortable in class and is helpful and fun. :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjYyMTUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3302","date_posted":"2012-05-05 22:36:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr D is an awesome professor. She understands that students have lives outside of class and she will work with you on due dates. She keeps classes to the bare minimum and she grades fast and clear. I would recommend her to anyone who wants to learn. Before her class I had never written a lesson plan and now I am confident I could do it at any time.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjA2NTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3302","date_posted":"2011-12-02 16:58:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her for Educ 3302 and she's awesome! She's very nice and a great professor. Some of her assignments are a bit of work, but she's very helpful and good about giving back quick and clear feedback if you have any questions. Do assignments and go to class and it's easy. I would recommend her to anyone!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzY0MzYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
