We don't have any grades expect for participation, a partner project (which not many people did well on) & the final. I personally would not take her again. The semester is over, with a week till grades & I still have nothing graded.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDc4MzMw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED4432","date_posted":"2016-04-26 12:18:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor was very inspiring and it was obvious that she is passionate about English language learners. She loves her job and it made it easy for me to go to class. This is an easy class but you also learn a lot!

She helps you really understand Spanish and how student's view points are who have a main language. She keeps class very entertaining and always moving. There is only one project that you work with a partner and a final. She is good about due dates and does not want you to feel rushed. Would definitely take her again!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjI0NjAx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED4432","date_posted":"2016-03-30 12:08:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I did learn a good bit from this class. But it was a little frustrating that she kept cancelling class. I hope I end up with a good grade because I feel like I put in more work than she did. On the bright side, there isn't much work except for one paper on student analysis that must be completed with a partner.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjAzNTgx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
