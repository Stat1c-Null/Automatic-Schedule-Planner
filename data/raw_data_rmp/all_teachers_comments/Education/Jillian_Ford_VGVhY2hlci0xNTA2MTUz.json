She is an amazing professor and receptive to multiple perspectives. You get out of this class what you put into it. If you complete all of the readings and engage in the class mtgs, you will find this class challenging. If you don't read or turn on your Teams camera, you will find it easy.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTM3MDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2021-01-13 00:14:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took online and the class was very easy, however she was very disorganized the whole semester. No grades the whole semester until the very end where I'm pretty sure everyone just got an A. Very political class. Not a bad teacher at all, but was disorganized and hard to reach out of class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjY5NDA1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2021-01-12 21:54:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Ford was the easiest teacher I have ever had.

Before the class began, I had no idea how we would be able to learn all aspects included in the course title: Social Justice and Service Learning through Autoethnography. Dr. Ford somehow made all of that gel, through working on the KSU farm!  Most importantly, I learned so much about myself.
