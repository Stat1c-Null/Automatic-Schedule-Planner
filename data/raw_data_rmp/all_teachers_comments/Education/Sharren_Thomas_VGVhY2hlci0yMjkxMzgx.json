She met with us one-on-one to provide feedback on a lesson-plan project, tell us she was pleased with our performance, and then give us C's when we turned it in. She has the attitude that her class is not doable, but you can try your best if you really want to.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMDYyMzQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

We wrote over 20 paged lesson plans that would get you a B after spending weeks on it and meeting with her. She is condescending, rude, and makes you feel inferior. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS unless you want a semester of stress.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODkyOTEz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--SO MANY PAPERS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECE4409","date_posted":"2018-03-21 22:47:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Thomas is great! If anyone feel any different then it is probably because she told you something you didn't agree with about your work. She is helpful and breaks things down so well to make sure you understand. Most students who complain are those who talk the whole time in class or are never on task. Dr. Thomas is my favorite professor!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjgxMDkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4408","date_posted":"2017-11-08 09:57:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor in the Education department. She's rude/condescending &amp; constantly changing assignment guidelines and due dates. She'll literally change things last minute and just send an email instead of telling us in class. I'm not lazy and will work hard for an A, but Thomas makes it impossible. Her weekly quizzes are challenging- DONT TAKE HER","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU2ODYx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

She is condescending and kind of a bully, but I have an A in her class. Not my first pick, but she's honestly not terrible. She's a professor, not you're friend, so she is pretty sassy. She'll tear you apart in comments, but give you an A/B on the assignment. If it's her or nothing, just take her lol","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODMxNzQy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--SO MANY PAPERS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE4408","date_posted":"2017-11-02 15:13:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor ever.

She grades you like you are a grad student when this is probably your very first education class. She is also pretty merciless as well. I wouldn't take her again.
