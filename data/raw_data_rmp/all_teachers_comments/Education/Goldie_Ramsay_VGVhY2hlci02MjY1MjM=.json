No the class isn't easy,but if you work it isn't that hard. She gives alot of work and expects alot and I think that she prepares you very well.Plus I got an A in the class and all I had to do it my work...plus isn't that the key to teaching....","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMTc4MDc0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3308","date_posted":"2006-07-03 00:21:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was a train wreck. We had a few big projects (nothing new in Education classes).  Projects were graded HARSHLY, I'm talking failing grades on projects that were done exactly the way they were instructed to be done (and better...I'm a perfectionist). I've never made below a B on anything...this class changed that. Just dont do it....","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMDUwNDgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2204","date_posted":"2006-02-14 09:46:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She constantly had expectations for the class that she either did not communicate or uphold herself.

She'd spend the first 15 minutes telling the class what her daughter was up to, then the next 10 minutes chewing out the class for not doing the assignment like she wanted it.  Of course, she never explained anything well enough for you to know what to do.

Pretends to be your friend but isn't.  Says she's smarter than any student-that's why SHE is the teacher. Very unclear with instructions/then swears she was.

She was a bit unclear about some assignments but when she was unclear, she was leanient on the grading, & you weren't held accountable. She is opinionated but VERY open minded. She works well with you on due dates & gives time off if she feels it's deserved/needed. So sweet and wonderful- take her if you can.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzQzNDc=","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
