I submitted a complete rough draft and only received generic feedback. Then, she graded the final draft incredibly harshly and took off credit for things that where not even commented on in my rough draft. Do not take her class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzA3OTg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDRS8200","date_posted":"2022-04-15 19:00:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Kim is impossibly difficult. It is like she is teaching a different course than what is described. She is a tough grader, and her feedback is unhelpful. I was left more confused by her feedback than helped. Her virtual course is full of dead links and numbers do not match required textbook. I would avoid her class at all costs.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDg1Mjk4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDRS8200","date_posted":"2019-07-25 19:26:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Kim is very friendly &amp; answers queries quickly. However, her feedback was inconsistent. I turned in a nearly complete &quot;rough&quot; draft and got only positive feedback. However, she took points off the final draft for things she had said were &quot;great&quot; on the rough draft.

However, the class felt disorganized and confusing quite often. The class focuses on creating a proposal, and that's fine, but we got very little direction in how to actually do that. I was extraordinarily stressed at the end of the semester because of this class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTY5MjYw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
