My only drawback was this class was almost 3 hours and we did tons of busy work. Sometimes it's not a bad thing to let us go a few minutes early, but not the case here. Otherwise very easy and a great teacher.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTAzODgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3302","date_posted":"2009-12-08 10:40:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love love loved this class! It was very informative, organized, and fun.  She was very fair in her grading and made the assignment applicable to real life! NO TESTS!! I would take her for under water basket weaving if she taught it!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDkzNzE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
