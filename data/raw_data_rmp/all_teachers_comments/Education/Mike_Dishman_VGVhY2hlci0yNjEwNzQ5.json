He seemed to want to help as much as he could. However, he was a very slow grader (last week of class, only 2 of 10+ assignments graded), incredibly tough grader (one of the hardest I've had), went back on things mentioned in the syllabus. I wouldn't take again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTIwNDcx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
