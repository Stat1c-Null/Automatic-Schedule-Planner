Her communication is outstanding and she answers very quickly. This class is not your average class when it comes to asynchronous work, so be prepared.

She is accessible any time of the day and any time of the week. The course was led through Dr. Driver through her videos so it wasn't really taught by Dr. Bessette but she is still sweet. There are a lot of assignments but if you take it online you can definitely stay ahead.

The field experience is ALOT, the lesson plan is ALOT. This is not an easy A class. She responds quick to emails if you need help. You can redo the lesson plan if you do not like your grade.

She did not have clear instructions. I would email her and her emails were even more confusing. this class is also a 6000 level class and literally had me crying weekly because this class is too much.
