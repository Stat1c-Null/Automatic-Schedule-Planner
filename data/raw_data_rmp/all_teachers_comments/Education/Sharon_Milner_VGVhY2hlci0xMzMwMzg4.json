Glad it's over. It's her way or no way.  Lesson plan stressed me out. Classes are B O R I N G! Just talking about her experiences. Field Experience was great though!

Those who have worked around preschoolers long enough (myself included) will be frustrated with her teaching philosophies.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTU0MzU5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3313","date_posted":"2012-06-05 19:35:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"While Dr. Milner was somewhat disorganized, she really knows alot about preschool education.

I turned in the same assignment multiple times because she kept losing it. she NEVER comes to class prepared. we spent hours watching pointless youtube videos. She will NOT discuss your grades. She gives them to you and that is it! You will never know why you got points taken away.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTUzMDYx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3350","date_posted":"2011-04-15 09:01:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take her!!!!!!!!

She is teaching an education class, and the only thing I learned was how NOT to be a teacher.  She doesn't explain assignments and claims that we have freedom to do them as we see fit and that she grades objectively, however when the time for grades comes she is HARSH!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzQyMDcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2009-12-14 12:20:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Milner definitely knows what she's talking about.  All the students in my section must have come from low level junior colleges because they didn't like how laid back Dr. M was, and how she let us basically control the class.  She was very helpful, told us exactly what's on the tests, and a super easy grader.  Definitely take her if you can!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTQ4MDQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
