Everything is simple to understand for the most part, even despite last minute changes in her due dates. I had very little interaction with the professor herself, however I had a fun time being in this class. Workload is super manageable, and she makes sure to give you everything you need to succeed.

I took it online and was unfortunately disappointed with her. She claimed she would be very attentive but only ever communicated with us last minute. She changed due dates and assignments often and didn't communicate them effectively. Her D2L is very unorganized and doesn't match the syllabus.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MzA4MTAy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"educ2110","date_posted":"2024-04-01 16:14:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you want an easy A this class is the way to go!

She is very understanding and patient. She is one of those professors who understand that her class isn't the only one that you are taking. Allowed you all semester to turn in past assignments and receive full credit still. Most assignments were done together in class. I got a 100 on every assignment.TAKETHISPROFESSOR","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MDc1NzAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"educ2110","date_posted":"2024-01-10 17:17:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is really sweet and knows what she is talking about.

She makes her class super informative and interesting. All you have to do is complete the assignments which are super easy and understandable and you get an A. She did not have any ratings beforehand which I thought was risky but she is definitely worth taking.
