Most of class is spent with her getting side tracked and rambling about different stories. You will learn some, just not a lot. Kind of a pointless class. It is hard to stay on track because she is all over the place. Easy grader though.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTU5MTg5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDRD3330","date_posted":"2019-11-06 21:13:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"She clearly cares a lot about her students but is disorganized. She doesn't give very clear instructions or grading criteria. It's not hard to get a good grade in here and you will still learn a lot, but this class can be frustrating due to her disorganization.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzcwNTI2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
