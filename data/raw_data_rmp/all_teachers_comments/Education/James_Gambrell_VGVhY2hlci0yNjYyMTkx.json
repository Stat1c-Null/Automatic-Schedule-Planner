He truly cares about what he is teaching and was so kind and helpful through all assignments. He made sure all students feel acknowledged and seen and to never hesitate to ask questions.

If he taught more classes, I would take them with him. He truly cares about his students, is always available for questions with quick responses, and understands that we have lives outside of his class. If you have something interfering with an assignment due date, he will work with you.

He gives a lot of feedback. His class was an easy A. I took his class in the summer and there were not many assignments.

The professor is caring, but he is giving out assignments that hit nerves, and I feel like this class does not hit the message it should be. He was a good professor though if you have to take this. There's a lot of work to do on your own and with groups without any oversight.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjQwNTI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
