No matter if you turn in the assignment late or you missed something he normally gives everyone a 100. Sometimes he would take attendance but not always. He likes you to participate in class and most classes were getting with your group and talking about a topic. Super easy and nice. I would take again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDI1MDI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2023-04-20 19:12:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Amenyah is a great professor. His curriculum is a bit assignment-heavy but he accepts late work (and he is very understanding about it!). Attendance isn't mandatory. He provides extremely thoughtful feedback along with grades. He appreciates classroom participation. The class itself is really easy. I will say, he could be a bit absent-minded.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Njc2NDAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Gives good feedback--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
