The class was fairly easy because of clearly laid out instructions in resources from other professors. Vry nice man, but not completely understanding in english which made answering student's questions extemely hard, with a clear answer. He offered many extensions because of the work load of assignments.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NDMxNDc2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC8100","date_posted":"2021-10-15 20:03:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Zheng is a very kind man, but I did not enjoy his instruction. The content/instructions were consistently confusing, and he wasn't very responsive to questions (except via synchronous sessions).

Instead, the course constantly referred to a text we did not have.

He doesn't stick to due dates. He changes what point values assignments are worth. He provides no valuable feedback.

I'm pretty sure he just moves due dates to avoid grading things.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjE5ODQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDUC7741","date_posted":"2018-07-26 10:09:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Was personable and responsive but gave different responses to different ppl.
