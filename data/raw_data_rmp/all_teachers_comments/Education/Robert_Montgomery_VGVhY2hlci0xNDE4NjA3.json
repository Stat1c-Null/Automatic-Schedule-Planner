In light of the pandemic, he went as far as to give us his number if we need him. It's unlikely that you'll find a prof. that cares as much as he does, he's your biggest fan, and always eager to help. I could go on, but there's a text limit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjU0NDQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3310","date_posted":"2019-12-23 22:47:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Montgomery made a nearly three-hour-long class engaging and interesting.
