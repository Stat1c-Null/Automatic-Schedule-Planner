If you want to learn about practical ESOL methods and strategies, take her class. She knows her stuff. She has traveled and taught worldwide. She walks the talk and then teaches her students to walk the talk. Excellent professor. I learned so much this semester.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDg3NDYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDRD3330","date_posted":"2014-05-01 19:47:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is seriously one of the best professors I have ever had. Super helpful, and actually reads your work and provides feedback. You must buy the books, but they are really easy to read.
