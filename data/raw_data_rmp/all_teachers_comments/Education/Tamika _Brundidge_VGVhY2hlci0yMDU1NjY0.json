Some assignments were not very clear but I got that out of a lot of students taking this class with other instructors this semester as well. She however took out a lot of work and made the class very manageable. Taken her for two classes now and love her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTk1NTA4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3316","date_posted":"2016-04-24 15:00:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am so glad, I didn't go by the reviews and I decided to take Professor Brundidge! She is super sweet! Sometimes she is unclear on assignments and doesn't know a lot about the assignments herself, but she is always willing to find out and let you know. She is always willing to help. I loved this class!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzY1MjIw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDU3313","date_posted":"2016-04-16 22:02:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"She works the students.

But she did not know what we were supposed to do for assignements, fxp, and so on. She copied the syllabus from another professor, but didn't look into it. She has really strong beliefs about the school system and talks about them at length, even though it's a preschool class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTQ4OTQ1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
