I would say about 90% of it is group work. This is such a pain because our group has to Skype every week to get our assignments done - and it's a good thing I have a good group! All assignments are part of a huge unit plan that you build on every week.

Over half way done with this class online and everyone in it is MISERABLE! Almost every single project is a group project, and there is a massive project due EVERY week.
