There is something to do every week. Do not wait until the last minute to watch all of your field experience videos, because she does not post enough to reach 15 hours, so you will have to look some videos up on YouTube for it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTM0NjYx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2019-04-22 19:58:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"i took this class online and theres something do everyweek. if you do any of the assignments wrong she tells you how to fix it and lets you turn it in again. there were two group projects and they were really easy","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjQ1MDA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2018-12-11 10:59:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"The instructions and videos for the assignments are vague/unhelpful, but that does allow some flexibility in how you would like to present it. There were two group projects and four discussion posts, along with a few other assignments here and there. Feedback was fine.

She shows favoritism to some students, but she makes it clear when she doesn't like you. Dr. Gray contradicts herself and is dishonest. Please make sure that you have everything in writing.

I had an A going into the last week of class, and my collaborating teacher sent my evaluation in late to Prof. Gray and she wouldn't accept it..ultimately causing me to fail the class!

She facilitates her students learning. For my class, she did not teach new material.  The students taught the class by outlining the textbook chapters and presenting to the class.  It was a fun experience.  Major point, multiple-choice tests could have tainted this experience, but this creative teacher allowed open book test. Great!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMDM3MzYy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
