You have to do short readings out of each book and then discuss it in class. If you show up to class and do the assignments then you will get an easy A. Make sure to put many details any paper you write for her. She likes for her students to write long papers.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODE5NjUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2015-12-10 13:59:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Thomas is so sweet. The class consists of reading the textbook/stories and discussing it in class. I only read about 1/3 of all of the material and still made an A. There are no tests, but she will ask to write down what you read to make sure you understand. Attendance is mandatory because  after x times a letter drops.

I busted my butt,but missed a few classes due to being sick, & she claimed I missed over the 5 days of class allowed so my hard earned \"A\" became a \"B\".

She cares about her students and what they think. You don't really have any tests, but the assignments are long (even after she shortens them), but they're not difficult. She really values participation and opinions, so speak in class and be respectful and you'll do great. Amazing teacher.

Really upbeat and helpful. Discussion based class, expects you to be respectful of everyone in class, but students lead discussions.  Learned a lot in this class about how to promote multicultural education and combat racism.

This was her first time teaching, and she was great. I can only imagine she will be better each semester. Assignments are simple and clear, and she grades fairly.
