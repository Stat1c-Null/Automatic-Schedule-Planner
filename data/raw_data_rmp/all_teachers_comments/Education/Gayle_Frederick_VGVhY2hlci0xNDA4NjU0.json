She changes the syllabus every other day, she teaches from the book with no notes, and the tests came from questions she made up. I had no idea what was going to be on the tests until the day before when she gave us the study guide. I learned nothing and my entire class agreed.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MTYyMzM2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2010-11-17 11:46:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really liked her. She is smart and highly educated. She makes a few mistakes with her vernacular, but it doesnt take away from anything.

The professor really cares about her students and helping to prepare them to be the best educators that she possibly can.

She doesn't go my the syllabus at all. She will just make up assignments at the set of her pants and will only give you a few days to get it done.

Some students missed as many as 9 classes and received an 'A' in the class. They did not even have to take the final.

It might as well be called &quot;I'm mad at white people.&quot; The text is filled with anti-white wording. The class is supposed to be about diversity, instead, it was about 1 hour and 15 minutes too long. Also, the teacher never answered my emails. Bad class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTU5OTA4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2010-05-09 22:07:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Without question one of the worst experiences of my college career. There were many students absent throughout the semester, and even they got good grades. The teacher is difficult to contact. She had no office on campus and did not respond to emails.
