The course content was created by the head of the program, so the teachers only have to grade your assignments. The teacher provides a rubric with every single assignment so make sure you follow that rubric and hit every point. The rubric is the key is passing!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDQwMjQw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--So many papers","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3300","date_posted":"2021-10-15 16:06:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Responded to emails 2-5 days later THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I ASKED. Content is written by the department head, instructors for this course only grade the material you submit.
