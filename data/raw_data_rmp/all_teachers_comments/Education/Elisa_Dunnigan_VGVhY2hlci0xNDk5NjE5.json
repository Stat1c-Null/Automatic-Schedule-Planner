It takes her more than two weeks to email students back, takes over a month to grade assignments, and lack of communication caused all of us to struggle.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTMwNTI4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDU2010","date_posted":"2015-12-15 22:33:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Material  not difficult; teacher  flexible with some due dates. Very frustrating at times. Modules were unorganized and expectations were not always clear. Teacher seemed MIA majority of semester, did not update class enough. Sometimes hard to reach by email.

Due dates were off so the whole class was confused. And links didn't work for lots of the modules. However if you posted in discussions Professor Dunnigan would clarify. It was hard to reach her by email however. I would advise just asking your classmates.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzM0MDY0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2013-04-10 00:33:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took this class online.  She is super nice and has very reasonable expectations.  She wants to help you understand the material in any way that she can, and answers the mandatory 3 questions from the reading DB post (due each module).  Work is reasonable and she is willing to work with you!  I would recommend that you take this class!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTEwODEz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2013-01-01 13:50:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy class, but a lot of the assignments in the online class had 2 different due dates depending on where you looked. A lot of confusion, but Professor Dunnigan was more than helpful, despite the confusion.

She is funny and nice and her class is enjoyable.  She gets you excited about teaching.  Work is really easy! Just two quizes and some easy homework.  You only need the teacher observation workbook.

Class discussions are interesting and she really loves teaching. Attendance is taken but is only 5%. Book is a must for the TAKE HOME final exam!
