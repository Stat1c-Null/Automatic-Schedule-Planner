He is an excellent teacher with years of classroom as well as research experience. He is extremely helpful and looks to mentor and be a resource for his students. Very relaxed and easy going. If you're in TESOL, I suggest you take as many classes with him as possible.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDA3MDMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
