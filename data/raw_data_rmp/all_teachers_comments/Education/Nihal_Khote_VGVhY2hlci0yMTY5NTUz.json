Dr. Khote gives vague assignments and feedback (if you even get feedback).  The class is unorganized and confusing.  One assignment we did this semester was copying and pasting terms from one chart to another.  In a 4000 level class.  Overall, I have learned very little in this class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDU2NTY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED4482","date_posted":"2022-05-16 14:27:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"I learned so much from him! He is so funny and engaging. He has real experiences that he brings to the classroom and it is very helpful honestly. The exams are a bit time consuming and a little tough, but all classes regardless of the professor, take the same exam. He helps you prepare for it though. Amazing!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzQ4NDg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED4431","date_posted":"2022-05-10 13:29:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Khote is a legend! Knowing his students were teaching during the day and were exhausted by night when it was time to complete course work, he held once weekly Zoom calls to discuss upcoming assignments and his expectations, later posting the recordings to D2L. His class only took me about 1.5 hours on Mondays when assignments were due!

He is kind, patience, and truly loves what he does. I was nervous about online classes this semester, due to Covid, but he seriously helped me get through it.
