She spends most of class time telling personal stories that don't relate to class. She is so scatter brain; most of the assignments didn't have clear instructions or a clear due date. She told her two classes different things all the time. Sends emails around midnight.

She never had clear expectations for any assignment or clear instructions. She grades extremely harshly on things that don't matter and there's no way to know what she wants. She never grades in a timely manner and only sends out emails at midnight. Every lecture was just her telling stories.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTQwMzMx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDRD3320","date_posted":"2021-11-08 05:00:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lee will tell you 3 different due dates for a single assignment, and then ask you to complete it in 3 different ways. Her directions were always unclear, and we all spent most of the semester confused. She had every assignment and module handed to her by the department and Im not convinced she ever read them until the day we did them.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjAzOTE2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDMG3330","date_posted":"2021-11-01 16:09:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Lee started the class by sending an email saying she was &quot;absolutely devastated&quot; that we did not turn in an information sheet on time. She was all over the place in her grading and expectations and everyone was confused. She blames every other professor in her department for her teaching and technological issues. It was incredibly frustrating.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTc0NjUz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2014-07-04 13:19:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr.Lee is an amazing teacher!!! I highly recommend her if you are seriously interested in the education field. The course load(modules)is heavy but as you as long complete the readings you will do great.

Dr. Lee wasn't sure what she wanted out of this class, never got set dates, one class dhe may say she wants a group project one way and by next class she changes her mind.  Has wonderful stories, but she doesn't give good feedback, it is always negative and not helpful.  Doesn't explain her grading on projects.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTU3OTY1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2012-04-21 15:25:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a great professor.
