I took a hybrid version of this class and the quizzes come straight from the material.  Very understanding if a group member isn't pulling their weight on assignments and will let you work solo.  She is wonderful.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMDE2Mzcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2013-04-05 20:04:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take her! Take her! She talks a lot, but you can tell she really knows her stuff and has a passion for teaching. She really uses D2L,but she makes sure you know where to find everything. She is the most helpful prof I've had yet--always responds to emails quickly,is flexible/understanding. A lot of group work, but no tests!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDkzMDgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
