You had to work for it. However, her rubrics were very clear and drew exactly what was expected. She was super nice, although we never met her personally because it was asynchronous.

How is her score not lower on here?? If you ask her a question about something, she gets annoyed and wonders why. Has no motive to build any kind of relationship with any of her students. I made an A in her class because I kept up with the workload, but she as a person? UGH.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjcxOTQ4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2021-04-28 16:14:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"The online format of this class is TOUGH, but that's not her fault. My only complaint about this professor and not the class is that she grades the lesson plan parts on C&amp;W first and transfers that grade to D2L which made us get like 75 on some stuff.
