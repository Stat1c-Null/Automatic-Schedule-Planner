The tests were not too difficult if you understand the material. And she explained some of the concepts in easy-to-understand terms.

So, if you can sit and occasionally participate in discussions on top of completing the few assignments, you can easily make a A. Can only miss 2 classes though, very easy grader, and responds to emails fast.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MTA1NjI3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HON1100","date_posted":"2022-12-07 03:17:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"hon 1100 is so boring and theres no way around that but dr. M is very kind and understanding to each student and will make an effort to accommodate you if you communicate. took her 7 weeks course at 6-8pm so lectures were long and assignments are every other week but if you put in an hour or so of work to get it out of the way, you'll be fine","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDAwNTAy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MATH1001","date_posted":"2022-12-06 00:48:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loved Dr. Miller! She was so understanding when I was out with the flu and I met with her during office hours and she retaught what they learned in class. Reminds me of a highschool math class in the way she teaches. Not a lot of homework, and wasn't for a grade but I recommend doing it!

It is never consistent and you will be docked for the simple things. Basically if your explanation for a math problem could be confusing to a student, you will get no credit for it.

She is quick to answer emails and is nice when giving feedback. However, she grades things very hard. There were 3 exams in her class. Exam 3 was SO hard for no reason (which she acknowledged but didn't curve). Attendance is mandatory and at the end of the semester we had to say why we should get a good grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODM2MDcw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MAED3317","date_posted":"2021-05-13 07:18:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a very wonderful professor and her lectures were and class work were usually pretty manageable.

She is very understanding but will not take anything late so make sure everything is in on time.
