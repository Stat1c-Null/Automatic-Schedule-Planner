Follow the instructions and you will do fine. She does a good job of trying to respond to questions in a timely manner and is more than willing to help you if you ask her for it.

If you take her be prepared for some boring lectures. Most of the time we just sat in silence. Her papers are easy but she grades super weird and will knock off points for really minor things.
