The more you participate in discussions the better the experience. Sometimes her grading techniques seemed vague & based more on buzzwords. If you learn best through listening, great class. For those that learn best by reading, she doesn't do PPTs or give notes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDY0MDEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2013-12-15 12:47:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a good professor. She edited every rough draft and if you made her corrections and your paper was decent than you will get an A on it most likely. The final was easy just to revise one paper and i'm pretty sure everyone got a 98 on it if you did anything. Class can be very boring and drag on but for the most part it's a great class to take!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTYwMjE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HONENGL1101","date_posted":"2013-12-10 12:29:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved Dr. Morrissey! We wrote 5 papers and would turn in certain parts before the final draft. She really teaches you how to write correctly for college. For the final, you choose one of your 5 papers and edit it again and write a one-page reflection on it. VERY EASY! If you try, I can't see how you wouldn't make an A. Books are required.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDkwMzA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
