Just like any lit class, it's a lot of reading, but the novels are all books you'd want to read anyway, and she also understands about it being a lot and many weeks your only work is to read. Organized, quick to grade, and quality feedback. Final paper has been due in pieces so it's not stressful.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTI1Mzc3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2145","date_posted":"2023-01-13 17:51:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was an amazing teacher. Had us reading great and interesting books with audio discussions which are honestly a lot easier than written ones. Most of the grades are essays and there was one PowerPoint. She has peer reviews where you get and give feedback. She is accessible outside of class. Definitely read the books and put effort into papers.
