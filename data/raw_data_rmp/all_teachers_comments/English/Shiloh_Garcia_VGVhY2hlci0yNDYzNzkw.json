You have 6 free absences, and a discussion post every sunday due at 11:59. There are 3 papers overall and she is an easy grader as long as you follow the guidelines of the paper. If it is a MWF class you will most likely never have class Fridays. Gives busy work on rare occasions but definitely an easy A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDY4MjAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
