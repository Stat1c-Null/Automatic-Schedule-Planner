I only wrote 2 papers all semester. One being a research paper that you work on in class, and the other one is a group research paper. She is always willing to help you have any questions about your papers. Easy grader too.

THEY ARE EASY BUT YOU HAVE TO READ TO PASS AND IF YOU ARE FULL WITH OTHER THINGS TO DO, THESE QUIZZES CAN HARM YOU. But she lets you drop your lowest Test grade and you can retake a novel quiz to replace a bad pop quiz.

I don't believe that she knows the readings as well as expected and she always seems lost. I also could not stand the way she teaches,a lot of repeating and slowly speaking.
