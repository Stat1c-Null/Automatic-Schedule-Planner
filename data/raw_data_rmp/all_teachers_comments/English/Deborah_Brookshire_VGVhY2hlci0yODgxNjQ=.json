Enjoyed that we could do most of our work for the class well in advance, besides the group project and tests. My only complaint: she sends these alarming announcements constantly that would make us all worry for no reason.

Lots of discussions and quizzes. Be prepared for a group project where your team members are assigned. If you put in the work, it is incredibly simple to earn an A. NO late work accepted. Offers extra credit at the end of the semester. Great communication/replies to questions and emails quickly.

Yes, there is a lot of work, but she grades fairly easy. Do the work and you will be fine. I never read, but used the book on test and quizzes and made A's on them.
