She taught well and boosted my grade at the end with extra credit, but that's it. I would not recommend taking her.

Her rubric weren't clear and we had a meeting for every essay but even with that it wasn't much help. This class had me stressing all semester and the way she wanted her essays were pretty difficult if you are not a strong writer.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTQ4Njcz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
