Just put effort on your writing, come to every class. He gives random participation points. He grades papers a little hard, but he teaches you and if you want to dispute a grade, he allows it.

He's my favorite because he challanges you to think about things and motivates you to improve your skills out of a genuine love for the subject.  His class is only hard if you don't try.
