He is very specific on what he wants on his papers. There are no tests, just readings for homework, which aren't tough at all, but you better do them because he asks you questions online which will be graded and are a great grade booster! He's funny and makes class enjoyable. can only skip class 3 times!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzcwMTI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
