Easy class if you read and take notes (whatever he writes on the board will be on the exam). Drops 2 lowest quizzes and sometimes curves the test if the class grade is low. Expect to write two essays during the semester.  Awesome professor, would take again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTA3Njc3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
