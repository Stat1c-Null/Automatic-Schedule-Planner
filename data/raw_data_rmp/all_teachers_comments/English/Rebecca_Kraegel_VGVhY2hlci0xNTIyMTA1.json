There are only four essays due throughout the semester and a small assignment here and there. The attendance policy is set through the department, so no complaining here. She gives great feedback on essays, and help whenever you ask her for it. Would Recommend taking her. She's one of my favorite professors.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzODMwMjc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2014-11-17 10:14:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shes big on no cell phones during class, she grades you for participation.
