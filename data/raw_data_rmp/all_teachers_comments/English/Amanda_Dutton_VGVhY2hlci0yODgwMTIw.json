My favorite professor ever. She cares so much, and is so helpful. ENGL 1102 kind of sucks because so much weighs on a few grades, but she makes it easy to get an A. She sets you up so well!

I have had her for 1101 and 1102 and in both courses we had three major essays with a multiple choice final exam and small assignments every so often that are super easy. She is easy to reach out to and gives so many resources for help. Gives extra credit as well.

She does leave homework every class but if you organize enough it is extremely doable. Also, she really likes to work with international students so if English is not your native language you should definitely that this class and ENGL 1102 with her (if yo know italian she'll love you).","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTEwNDQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--So many papers--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2023-03-09 23:02:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is the best professor, and she gives extra credits.
