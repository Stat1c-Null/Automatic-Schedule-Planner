She really cares about the students and is super accessible any time of the day. There are four or five main assignments throughout the semester. All of them are not terribly difficult and she helps a lot with the planning and execution.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU5MjQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
