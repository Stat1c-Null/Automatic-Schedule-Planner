Shes not mean or difficult to get along with but when it comes to grading time you'd better batten down the hatches. I liked her a lot as a person, but as teacher not so much Her grading scale is nonexistent and steeped largely in preference","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjQxNTk2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2012-03-27 21:05:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is terrible! I am struggling in her class like no other professor. No rubric, just random grades. I have consistently made C's in her class. She claims that a \"C\" is a good grade. You pretty much have to be a god to make an A. Good luck.

However, she tends to change her mind about what she wants in the paper. On several occasions I have gotten marked off on stuff she told me to write (format, grammar, everything). If you have an option of taking someone else, I would.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjA3MzU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2011-04-14 10:31:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is super nice in class; however, it is impossible to receive an A, unless you can figure out her unique/rare/etc grading style. About 80% earned a C or lower, and 20% earned a B. She doesn't use a rubric, just pulls your grade out of a black hole. The corrections she makes on your paper does not support your grade. I would not recommend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NDA4OTI5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG67","date_posted":"2011-03-25 12:07:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"In class she is nice and laid back so you think that she will not be grading too badly. But once everyone gets their grades back, there are a few B's with mostly C's. I think there were 2 A's the entire semester on our paper. She does not really say what you can do better to get a better grade on your next paper.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzEyMDg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
