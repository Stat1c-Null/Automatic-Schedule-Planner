I  would have passed but I missed too many days when I was in the hospital. I was apparently skipping. I recently got my grade changed to a W because I had emergency surgery soon after the semester ended. If you have health problems you might want a professor that will help you out","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDM4ODE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2013-04-06 19:26:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved taking Ms. Martinez for english.

There are no tests just papers, blog posts, and just a few quizzes on the readings. She is a very good teacher i would deff recommend her. She lays out everything in the study guide so there are no questions. She also grades fair. You can miss up to 4 days and she also accepts late work for -10 points.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE0Njgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2012-05-17 09:32:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is so nice!

For her 1102 class, there are 4 major essays, and three short essays. It may seem like a lot at first, but the essays are really spaced out. She a really fun teacher. There are a couple of quizzes worth like three points each, but that is about it. Take this teacher!

This is her second semester here so she's slightly noobish, but generally very happy and interested in keeping the class engaged. No tests. Lots of reading-based discussions. Papers are graded pretty fairly and she offers lots and lots of help, so there's really no excuse to failing a paper. Take her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5ODQwNzIx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2011-12-14 20:05:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"she was such a good teacher. i think she said this was her first semester teaching but she was really passionate about everyone getting the best grades they could. always there to help.really sweet person. not too much reading just a few excerpts but she makes sure theyre interesting. best professor so far, definitely recommend her if you need 1101","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTExODM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
