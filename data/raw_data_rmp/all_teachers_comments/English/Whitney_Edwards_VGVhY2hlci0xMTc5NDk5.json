She does not like if people are late. Overall she is very harsh and at least for me it seemed that i wouuld get a low grade but i was surprised that i made a solid B in the class. Very Hot too. She is also there if you need help.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzE5NzU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2009-08-19 21:43:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Tough class. Treats gen-ed class as upper level english. I had her in the summer and we had to read at a very quick pace (a novel in a week) and we had to HAND WRITE our essays in class with a one hour limit. Essay grades were very tough and slow to get back. She likes the 5 paragraph essay format","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MTM1NjUz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2009-07-30 02:29:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"RUN RUN RUN RUN. This was a general education class and she was ridiculously harsh. I dont even think she read my papers fully as she contradicted herself in the grading...I honestly left class raging mad every time I got an essay back. She also took forever to grade our papers so we never knew how we were doing and what to improve on. HATE HER.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDc3MTU5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2009-07-25 19:48:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ok, so here's the deal w/ Dr. Edwards. If you're an English Major and want a teacher that will challenge you, take her. If you want some though provoking conversation and analysis, take her. If you are looking for an easy class, however, run as far away as you can. I really enjoyed her lectures, but the grading system was a harsh for gen-ed classes","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDY1NTcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2009-05-06 22:42:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was great, class was full of engaging discussion and she would work with people on their problems. She is very openly liberal but she open minded and fine with debate and discussion.

She holds you to a pretty high standard and expects you to think and do the work and all that, but as you long as you do it, she's cool. Gives very detailed comments on returned work, but takes a little long to return it. Very helpful, though.Available to meet for extra help.She's also young and has a sense of humor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzMxNjYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2008-12-20 20:09:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"She grades papers pretty easily but she is extreme about attendance.
