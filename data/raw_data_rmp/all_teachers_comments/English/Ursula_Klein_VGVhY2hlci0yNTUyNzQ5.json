I feel like she treats us as lower than her and like young children, for example she constantly choses our groups for everything as if we can't do so ourselves. Can be rude and grades WAY too harshly. Definitely wouldn't take her again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTQ0MzE0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2020-01-09 22:04:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"I absolutely loved this class, my writing drastically improved and she was always willing to go the extra mile to help her students. We wrote papers in both MLA and APA. At the end of the semester, our final was to revise our essays in a portfolio which improved my grade by five points. She's a great professor I wish i had her for 1102","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODE3NjMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2020-01-01 02:26:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"The best way to describe her class is just like how a high school English teacher runs her class. She makes you partner up with people you don't know to peer edit all the time. Would get really mad when nobody wanted to participate in class discussions. Rarely used the textbooks, waste of money. And gave so much homework.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzc5NTk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2019-12-14 01:13:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very rude to her students and comes across as pretentious. She makes you read things about feminism and climate change for basically every paper. Dont buy the books its a waste of money youll only use them a few times. She is picky when grading and will write rude comments about your papers. Tons of homework.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjUyMzg1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
