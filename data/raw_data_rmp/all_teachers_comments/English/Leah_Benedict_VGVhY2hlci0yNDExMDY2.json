No textbook was needed, just access to children's stories. Most of the work was reading responses, plus a midterm and final essay. I loved that she gave essay extensions, but sometimes she didn't post reading assignments or respond to emails. Still, the class was rewarding.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjg4OTU4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2024-12-12 01:16:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Love her she's wonderful!
