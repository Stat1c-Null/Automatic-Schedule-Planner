It was easy, just make sure to read the chapter(s) from the textbook before each class so you are prepared for a class discussion. Attendance is mandatory, but you have 3 days excused. There were 5 things total she graded by and they were fine, just do the work and participate!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDQ2NjU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2145","date_posted":"2024-10-30 21:33:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"I TOOK HER FOR 2130! I absolutely loved this class. I took her over the summer, and she was quick to email back; and it was movie and reading heavy. The exams were written, but you can use your notes. They weren't difficult at all. All the movies were incredibly interesting. I highly recommend this professor for English 2130.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODc0MDI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL4570","date_posted":"2018-05-09 16:58:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Contribute to the discussions each class and be knowledgeable of the texts. I did a mixture of skimming and sparknotes; it's a lot of reading. What really matters is the final paper, which she's super helpful with. Wants you to do well. Max 3 absences, each after that is 5 points off your final grade. I would have gotten an A but for that.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDQyNjQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Skip class?

We do use a tiny Literary Theory book, which you can rent super cheap. She's nice and encourages students to think and discuss new ideas. I enjoyed our class discussions even though I'm not a \"discussion person\". She's always available, provides great feedback, and will work w/ you.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTkzNzQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FILM3210","date_posted":"2015-11-19 12:03:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's one of the best professors I've taken and she makes film class incredibly interesting and I absolutely loved her.

Best Film teacher at KSU by far, and I've taken several. If you are a Film minor or REALLY care about learning she is the teacher to take. There is a midterm, final, pp presentation, and paper, no HW. If you come to class and pay attention they're all super easy!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0OTc3NjI1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2174","date_posted":"2014-05-05 10:18:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her teachers are rather boring for a subject that needs a little pick me up. She lets her own opinion affect all the readings so expect the same story over and over.
