Class includes a midterm, final, 6 short quizzes and one 5 page paper. Make sure to read the assigned reading and you will do fine.

There were three papers, but they were all on the same subject.. First two were 6 pages and the third one was going to be 12 pages, but he brought it down to 9. Plus, we read a pretty boring research book and had quizes on it almost everyday. Not a bad class, but not very good either.

He doesn't lecture for long and you almost always get out of class early. He had 3 papers he assigned in my class. Two papers were 6 pages each and the final was 9 pages. He has conference days to help you with your essays. The quizzes could be difficult but they got easier as the class went on.

He only gives 5 papers the whole semester and that's about it, besides the quizzes he gives just about every class . But they're real simple.  If you go to him and ask him to look over your paper he'll like you and work with you that much more. Could not have asked for a better Eng 1101 professor.

He's a laid back, chill professor. With his papers and test, you'll be confused and won't be sure as to what to expect. He has open discussions and doesn't force anyone to talk. Great night class. He's a great professor, just a little confusing time to time. Can miss up to 3 classes. Extra credit for commenting.
