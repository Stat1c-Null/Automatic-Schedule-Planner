Show up and follow directions, and you should be fine. If you're really looking to improve your writing skills, however, she may not be the best professor for you. She teaches high school full time, and it's she doesn't have much time to help you individually.

She is always willing to help you succeed. She is a fairly tough grader when it comes to papers but if you do your best you should be fine getting an A or B should be no problem.

Prof. Wells made the transition smooth for me. She expects you to come to class and come prepared. She doesn't appreciate slackers or tardiness but expects you to put effort into her class. Super nice, helpful, responds to emails throughout the day and fairly quickly. Great class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDY5ODcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":24,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL11011102","date_posted":"2014-03-27 16:24:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is amazing! Loved her so much in English 1101 that I took 1102 with her too! She's funny, super cool and easy going. There are a few essays you must write plus a final presentation which is not stressful at all (And I'm super shy!). There are rare occasions were she might give you at-work study/work time.
