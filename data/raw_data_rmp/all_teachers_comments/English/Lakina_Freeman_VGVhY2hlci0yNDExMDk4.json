Little to no communication and no feedback given on essays while grading harshly by just circling categories with no reasoning to it.

She cancelled class often, and graded assignments late if at all. She rarely lectured, just talked about the class agenda she wouldn't fallow. She would let her own personal politics get into the debates and assignments, She gave assignments due soon, but at last minute would postpone them. horrific.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTk5NjIz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-03-14 06:45:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I could count how many times we had class in person on one hand. she usually sends a text saying class is cancelled, but one day everyone showed up but by 5:45 we started leaving.
