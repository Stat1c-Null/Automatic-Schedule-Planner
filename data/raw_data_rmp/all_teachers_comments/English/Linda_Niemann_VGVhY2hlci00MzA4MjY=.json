She's super sweet and gives amazing feedback on our 10 page stories, then spends weeks having the class workshop each other's stories. Very helpful actually. Have to read and discuss an entire novel each week though and I never have the time, also two short writing assignments each week to read in class. Very forgiving and kind.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjgxNzcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--SO MANY PAPERS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WRIT3130","date_posted":"2016-05-17 13:54:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Niemann was awesome. We read plenty, and were all instructed to lead a discussion. She expects weekly writings, including the time you may be work shopping. It's not's hard but it definitely requires you to display more effort in your writing.

She has the most amazing life story to tell. Just by sitting and talking with her in class, you'll gain your money's worth. However, if you need help you must seek it - and come to class.

Yes, the workload was heavy all semester, both the writing (expected) and reading assignments. But Dr. Niemann gave us a lot of good tips in class on writing better creative nonfic; she also gave us individual feedback on manuscripts.

Your grade will suffer if you do not embrace the memoir. Otherwise, it is a group driven class with minimal input from her. The readings are also quite provacative. It can turn into group therapy at times.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDg1ODcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PRWR6520","date_posted":"2010-05-22 21:11:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"I heard a lot of good things about this professor prior to taking her class. I am a writer and I was interesting in learning more about the non-fiction genre. Sadly, the class was a waste of my time and I learned nothing. I was very disappointed. The class was more of a literature/ group therapy class than it was an actual course on writing.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjUzOTQy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PRWR6520","date_posted":"2010-05-04 16:52:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"I am surprised at the positive comments here.  She's a nice person, and she doesn't require much of students. I guess some people like that, but I'd rather learn something. It was a writing class, but we almost never worked on writing.

I also took her for World Lit.  She was fair, gave extra credit and was completely approachable.  She does not ask too much in her writing assignments, but if you are bothered by very progressive reading material (I'm not), you might have a problem with her class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzMjk0Mzc4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CREATIVENONFIC","date_posted":"2006-05-24 11:12:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really learned a lot in Dr. Niemann's class.
