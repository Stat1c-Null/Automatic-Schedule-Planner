If you are into highly debated topics in the U.S then this class is for you as you will get a large in depth look at several topics. She is certainly helpful but at times the class feels like a drag and like a political debate.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MzExMjg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2017-05-08 21:51:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great professor and very understanding. She is clear of what she wants from you. For this semester, we wrote 4 papers and had a discussion post due every week over a passage or book we read. Attendance is worth 5%.

I like writing but she helped me learn how to write better and to be more secure in my abilities. She cares and is passionate about the subject. I have taken her twice!

She is very understanding. If you miss communicate with her. She gives the mandatory amount of essays, but guides you through them. Occasional extended deadlines and extra credit.
