She loves the details. She teaches from experience, not from a degree, which I think is a breath of fresh air in an academic setting. Highly recommended!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTIyNjgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM2010","date_posted":"2009-05-11 11:40:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a good teacher. This class can be very difficult at times so just do the work in her class and your grade will reflect on what you do. She also grades very harshly at time expecting perfection but overall she wasn't as bad as I heard.

She packs the classes with relevant information, and gives assignments that transfer to real world knowledge. Very well organized and will even come on the days you have off for &quot;studying&quot; if you have questions.
