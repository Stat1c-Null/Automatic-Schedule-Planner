The class isn't unnecessarily difficult and there are only 3 essays in the class, which she gives feedback on every time you complete one. She also let our class go 5-10 minutes early pretty often. Simply finish the reading logs (which are easy) and do the assignments on time.

If you get offended easily, maybe don't take this class. Dr Wells has a very down-to-earth humor, but I could potentially see some people getting offended. The classload is not terrible, and her grading is truly based on the effort you put into your work. This was my favorite course this year.

Her syllabus and assignments were borrowed from another professor who teaches a different course. She did not proofread them, so there were numerous, significant errors.
