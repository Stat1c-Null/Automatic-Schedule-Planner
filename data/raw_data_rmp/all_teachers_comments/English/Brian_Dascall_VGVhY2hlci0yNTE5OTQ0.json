Makes jokes and the class is very chill. He gives just the right amount of work, not too much or too little. His teaching is very clear, attendance matters to a certain extent. You cant skip all the time but you have a certain number you can miss, and I like that he gives you an exact number you are allowed to miss.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzY0NDQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2019-10-03 22:16:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hillarious as all get out.
