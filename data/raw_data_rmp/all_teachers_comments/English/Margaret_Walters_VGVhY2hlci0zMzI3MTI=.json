If you don't write about topics she likes, expect a B at most. She actually wrote, \"Your opinion is wrong\" and \"Your point of view is wrong\" on people's papers. How can someone's opinion be wrong? She is RIDICULOUS and such a disappointment to writers. Run away.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Mjk2Nzg2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2145","date_posted":"2014-12-08 19:17:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Feminist approach. I am a great writer. I got my paper back and it had almost no marks but I made a low B. A girl next to me had a completely red paper and made a high A. All that was on my paper was comments disregarding my opinion and saying that it was invalid. The papers in this class were so hard too. STEER CLEAR!

Like a funny old aunt with all these random stories. Very fair grader and lenient with due dates. I also took her Careers in Writing class and even though we didn't do much, it did help me focus and figure out things I DON'T want to do as a career.

She is very relaxed about the class. You get out early most of the time and work on your papers in class. There are 4 papers that she grades rather easily. She gives you main ideas, but you pick the topics to do the research. I suck at english and made an A. It is an easy A class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjMxMjA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2145","date_posted":"2007-12-31 15:40:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"NICE lady!
