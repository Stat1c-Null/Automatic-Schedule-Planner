Doesn't take correction or input from students. However grades are based on 3 papers, so it's an easy A. So long as you play along, ignore the cringe, and don't ever say a word to her, you should be fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzY4Njgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2016-09-17 18:33:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"She assigns textbook readings but then provides you with a synopsis of the reading several classes later. Everything builds on itself, she has you turn in smaller assignments leading up to papers, and peer editing is a grade.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2OTc4ODc1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMP1102","date_posted":"2016-08-30 10:13:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"The workload was pretty light, but this teacher has no idea what she's doing. I am genuinely surprised his score is this high. She clearly is pushing an agenda with her topics and if your view contradict hers things will be harder for you. She is all over the place when grading or giving feedback. She gets defensive if you pint out her mistakes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2OTQyNTYz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2016-05-08 08:24:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"You don't really need to buy the book unless you plan on doing a lot of writing later on. She discusses everything you'll be doing in class & explains things well. The topics in the class are bearable & even fun at times.

Rubrics are clear & concise, she's a very reasonable grader & she keeps the project topics interesting. You wont write the same paper I did.

I'm impressed she did what she did.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDU4NjQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2016-02-23 10:28:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pros: fair grader, relatively light workload, only 4 papers done.  Cons: took her all semester to grade essays 2-4, so no one knew how they were actually doing in class. Huge problem.

There even aren't many lectures, you usually just work on writing assignments most classes which are pretty easy. For the papers you write, she offers a lot of chances at getting her help which I would really recommend taking. The class is a pretty easy A if you put in minimum effort.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzE1MzUx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGLISH1101","date_posted":"2014-12-11 22:41:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty good teacher.
