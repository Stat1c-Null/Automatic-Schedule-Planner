Banned electronics, but class was in a computer lab. Rude the one day we met, if we met. She's strict on attendance, but was late ALL THE TIME. Inconsistent HW w/ grading delays & responses A LOT + no real feedback; made it hard to adjust or know what you need to work on. She couldn't spell either (as an Eng teacher = WILD).","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDI0MTI5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
