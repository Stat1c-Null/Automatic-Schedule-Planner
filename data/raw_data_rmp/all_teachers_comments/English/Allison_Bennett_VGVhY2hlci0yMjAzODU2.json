If you don't want to put an effort into work, don't take her. She truly wants her students to do well; very approachable if you have questions/concerns. 4 papers, 10 weekly entries, one presentation. She made 1102 a good experience for me. Highly recommend her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTMxNDQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2016-12-06 00:17:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Bennett is an amazing professor; the specific grading criteria provide a sound basis for a successful essay. Even though grades are based on effort and class participation, the use of tools provided in class makes the difference in the grade that a stunt receives. Professor Bennett also provides a plethora of feedback through D2L.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzQ1MDg4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
