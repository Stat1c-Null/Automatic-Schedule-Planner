She's very helpful, assignments that are not over the top, class is fun, very supportive & encouraging.  Brings out the best in each student, doesn't talk down to class.  She changed my entire perspective on Eng classwriting (which i used to hate).  Best English teacher you'll ever have!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzA1MzE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
