There are some easy papers and discussion boards to do, but if you're on top of those they won't be an issue. Biggest thing would be to at least skim the assigned novels and engage in the class discussions. He wants you to pass, so just talk to him if you've missed something.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTMxNDE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PRWR6810","date_posted":"2024-04-28 22:49:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of my favorite professors, hands down. Very knowledgeable about his topic, but also just a lot of things so class conversations were always very interesting and engaging. The class was practical and applicable; anybody would find him a very valuable, kind instructor to take. Decent amount of reading and work, but all worth it in my opinion.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjkyODYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PRWR6810","date_posted":"2023-12-13 19:09:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Milberger is a great professor! I took him online for ENGL2172. Very caring, easy to communicate with, offers great feedback, and is very clear about assignments. If I was able to, I'd take him for every English class.

Excellent teacher. He really wants you to learn and he challenges you. He's also very generous and helpful. He's quick to respond to email and provides thoughtful feedback. The two classes were structured so differently but I really struggled with both. Lots of reading (which I don't mind) and heavy course load, imo.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTcyNjE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PRWR6810","date_posted":"2023-05-13 01:54:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really simple and easy class along with a great teacher who is fun and cares about his students. I would recommend this class to anybody taking English. There is a semester long paper that takes up most of your grade, but he helps with the paper for the entire semester.

The beginning of the semester was a lot of writing, but it dies down toward the end. I had a hybrid class with very easy reading and short open-note quizzes for the online days. He has a great class and keeps it interesting. He also gives personal feed back on every paper that genuinely helped.

He's knowledgeable, clearly experienced in and connected to the publishing industry, and assigns projects that have direct real-world application. He also seems to be a genuinely caring human. His course requires you to self-lead/self-start, but he makes himself very available as a resource.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MzI3NTUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
