She is also way too punctual and won't cut anyone slack. She is also much too harsh on grading. She won't bump you by a point even though it's one of those 69, 79, 89, etc. grades. You should read for class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTYwNjky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2012-04-04 12:45:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"I hate English but I've enjoyed her class. She is really clear about what she wants, the reading are interesting. Peer workshop really helps with your papers. She is really nice and funny. She is a fair grader, you get the grade you deserve.

She is a very tough grader but you will actually learn something. I have never been more inspired by another teachers love and dedication to actually work as hard as i could myself.

She treats students like children and gets on to them for remedial things. She's a harsh grader, but I do admit that she's willing to help you with anything you need. I'd let her teach longer, then take her class.
