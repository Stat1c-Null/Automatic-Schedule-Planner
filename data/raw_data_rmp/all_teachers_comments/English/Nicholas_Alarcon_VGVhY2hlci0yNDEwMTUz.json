This is a professor who genuinely cares about his students and will do everything to make sure you pass. Easy grader if you do the requirements and ALWAYS gives positive feedback. If you get the chance, take his classes!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzY2NDQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2019-04-03 13:46:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is incredibly unwary of time. His instruction and expectation of assignments are incredibly unclear. Near the end of the semester, when all of our projects were due, he REFUSED to give a concrete answer to any clarifying question. He is an incredibly tough grader, and without real reason. Not worth the credit. I almost got my first B.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNTIyMjQ0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2019-01-07 20:13:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"He took a different approach to writing with the topic of creativity for the entire semester. He was super personable and encouraged us to interact with one another with various activities that challenged us to think about things from other perspectives.

He gives custom writing assignments that teaches you nothing and wastes your time. It is a very boring class where you get even more frustrated with his uncertainty and ambiguity.

Defiantly take it if youre looking for a class to make friends. Even if you dont want to make friends, youre going to make friends because the class is so open and welcoming.
