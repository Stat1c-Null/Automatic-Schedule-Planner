Although her grading was pretty tough on the essays, if you go to the writing center you will make a good grade. She is very personal and I really learned good writing skills in her class. I would say it was my best class so far! I recommend it!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTI1MzQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2009-11-23 09:32:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"She has a completely different teaching style than any teacher I've had. The papers are easy as long as you go to the writing center and get them reviewed first. Great class, i would recommend it to everyone. (the only down -for me- is that you HAVE to have a facebook for the class)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDE1NjM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2009-11-02 09:19:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"She gives you the schedule for the semester the first day of class. The entire class stays in touch on our private group facebook page. Only have 4 essays which is reviewed by classmates on peer review days. She grades hard on the essays but you learn how to improve your mistakes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Mjk4ODg3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
