Quizzes and final exam was easy if you study what she says to study. I'm a engineering major and enjoyed her class. I hate KSU for requiring this class for engineering majors. Attendance is mandatory because it's the English department's policy and not her policy. Easy class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwOTMxMTg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2018-11-08 19:43:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Was her first year teaching at this school when I took her. She assigns reading material for every class day, but you are only tested over the introductions of the chapters. Her quizzes are taken straight from an online resource that you can go to and take those same exact quizzes. Got A's on all quizzes. Only 2 essays and one was 300 words max.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjg5NTUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
