You have reading assignments, but sparknotes was more than enough for what he asks of you. Lectures are SO long and boring, but he takes attendance. Two lowest grades are dropped if you have good attendance.

Pre-annouced quizzes and he drops the 2 lowest quizzes if you have good attendance. He is kind of rude and won't help you if you ask. Takes attendance every class at the beginning of class.

His lectures are not relevant most of the time. He focuses on things he doesn't test over. He spends only a few minutes covering things you need to know. Has simple plot driven questions, while the midterm and final have you analyzing quotes and identifying author, speaker, and work. Do not take him","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzU4MTQ4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
