He was also very encouraging on letting your personality shine through your work, and he's also quite relatable. I wrote a 5 page essay about Dragon Ball Z and got a 100% on it. He was amazing!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDI4MTgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2024-03-29 17:46:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was an easy A.

Attendance was not mandatory, but you would not want to miss his class. We had so many great conversations and if you are ever confused about an essay prompt he will always help you. We normally get out pretty early and he is also understanding.

Very chill, attendance is mandatory but it's really more optional. With the times. So far all the essays are mostly up to the students, as long as they relate to the assigned topic. Very laid back, would take again. Don't really have to look at the assigned lesson plans on D2L. Would def take again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzEyMTIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2023-10-25 01:08:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very lenient with grading and open to his students if they need any help. I would take him again if I could since he's really easy going. You could make it through the semester without going to a single class but I recommend going whenever there's an essay or peer review due. All his tests, quizzes, essays are easy and straightforward.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzA2MTkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
