I took her in fall 2022 when it was her first semester teaching at Kennesaw State. She is amazing and genuinely cares about her students. She is always there to help. She assigns 3 papers throughout the semester, and you can write about whatever you want as long as you follow the criteria given. She is great!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzQ1NjMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGl1101","date_posted":"2023-04-19 14:53:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was amazing, and I would def recommend taking her. She didn't overload with work so you don't have to worry about being overwhelmed but I would recommend to participate because she cares about that.

She's a new professor and she's young, so she is still figuring things out understandably. There are 3 essays and the prompts are mostly very free and flexible, which is good and bad. I sometimes didn't know exactly what she wanted us to write about, but she's also not a super harsh grader.
