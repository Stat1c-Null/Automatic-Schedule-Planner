He really cares and knows what hes talking about when he lectures. Most of the time, he doesnt use up all of the class time and he lets you work on all of the assignments in class. He is really easy to talk to and is very willing to help out. The class is a breeze if you just do the work and go to class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTgyMDY2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2020-05-02 03:39:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor is by far the best I have ever had. He genuinely cares about his students and devotes endless hours giving personal feedback. For the research paper he breaks It up into sections having each part due as you learn it. This lessens the workload and enhances each part.

He gives a good feedback and seems to really know a lot about what he's talking about. The entire semester is devoted to working on the final research proposal/essay and gives it to you step by step.

He no longer cancels classes, instead choosing to not show up until 50 minutes into class and STILL take attendance. He has done this multiple times.

Hes a new professor so some things are still a little slow but youll still get them in time. Hes a little tough on grading the papers but give extra credit.
