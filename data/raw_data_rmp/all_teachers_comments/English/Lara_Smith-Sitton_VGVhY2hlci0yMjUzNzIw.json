She strives to help her students as much as she can. For anyone thinking about taking WRIT3111 with her - she focuses on developing content and editor duties &amp; relationships rather than mechanical editing (grammar &amp; punctuation). Take COM 3350 if you want to focus on mechanical editing instead","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjU2NzMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WRIT3109","date_posted":"2017-12-11 08:47:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Assignments and group projects are unclear. Dr. Smith-Sitton drops the lowest homework grade. Make sure you read the readings and participate in class. She gives pop quizzes and there is a final at the end. A bunch of busy work on top of the 3-4 classes already. She only allows group revisions.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTI2ODY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3398","date_posted":"2017-11-16 16:25:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"I came to Dr. Smith-Sitton right before my senior year. I had no plan or path and graduation was right around the corner. She set me up with an internship and guided me through interviews, resumes, deliverables, etc. If you are right to start pursuing an actual career then you must take this class. It won't be easy, but neither is the work force.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTE4NTQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WRIT3109","date_posted":"2017-05-01 19:14:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Smith-Sitton is wonderful!!
