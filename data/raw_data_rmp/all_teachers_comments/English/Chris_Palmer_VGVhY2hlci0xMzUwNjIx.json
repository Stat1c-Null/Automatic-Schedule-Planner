He is not easy, but you will learn. He is effiecient and never makes you feel like you are wasting your time. He is a young Mr. Holland.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTM0MzU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3035","date_posted":"2010-02-23 17:11:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher for a hard class.

The class (intro to language/linguistics) is tough but interesting. He cares about his students and as long as you put forth effort he will assist you. It's not so much that HE is hard, but the material that he teaches is difficult. This class is required for English and I absolutely recommend him.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzIxMjgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL4370","date_posted":"2010-01-05 15:42:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"he is approachable and will take the time to sit down one-on-one to make sure you understand the material. He gives a lot of tests, but if you do the reading and attend class you should be able to pass (start with the essay first). He is a little goofy, and he encourages a lot of class discussion. I definetly recommend taking his class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NjgwNTI3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3040","date_posted":"2009-12-04 17:20:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Goofy guy. It was an interesting class, but tests are stressful. He lets you use a one-sided cheatsheet, which helps, but you still need to know your stuff. Expect to give VERY detailed answers on tests. He certainly knows a lot and expects a lot from his students, but he's not a tyrant. If you need help he's always open to talk about the course.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDcyNDQx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
