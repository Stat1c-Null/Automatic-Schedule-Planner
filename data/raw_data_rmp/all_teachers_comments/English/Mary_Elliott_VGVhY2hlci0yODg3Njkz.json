Took her once in 1101 and taking her again. I came specifically looking for her, she's the best teacher I've had at KSU and she will make it her goal to know you and your learning style. Her grading is easy but she is straight forward with everyone. There will be no filters. She's funny and class time flies.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODI4NDY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2025-03-27 18:42:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her 1101 in Fall of 2024 and it was amazing. Don't let the reviews fool you-- the ones who marked negative are usually the ones who got on her bad side. She's great, she's personal, she makes an effort to help you as long as you try. She's not a hard grader, but she gives critiques. Some people don't like that but it's bare minimum.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODI4NDQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2025-01-03 05:37:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Elliott's course is very straightforward with many small assignments such as readings or discussion posts that can be time consuming due in between the big projects. Class time is almost useless when it comes to getting details on assignments. It's only used to see if you completed notes.

Her class this year was the first of her Brit Lit class and while English is definitely not my favorite subject, Dr. Elliott's fun lectures and quite honestly her antics sometimes made the class very fun!

For instance, she asked what she could do to make an assignment easier in the future for us and I answered. She responded by saying it wasn't her problem when she specifically asked us what we thought. The course material is also not very interesting as it's mostly musicals but that's subjective.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODczOTQx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2024-10-18 02:09:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Cool professor don't let the reviews fool you, she's very easygoing ","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODI2MTQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2024-10-18 02:05:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"The overall rating is very off.
