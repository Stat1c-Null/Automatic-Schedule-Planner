She will correct your paper so you can get a &quot;better&quot; grade, but then will give you a C on it.  Don't listen to the other reviews, you can't miss class more than twice, you feel like your in prison, and she doesn't know anything about historic events. Avoid if possible, she will drive you CRAZY!

Notice the doctor before her name so she has a very strange/different personality but its GREAT! absolutely need the book...and she gives you 3 revisions to make corrections so there is no reason anyone shouldnt pass & even get an A. also try to stay on top of the online assignments they add up at the end of the semester.

We had about 4 or 5 essays, and she gave us multiple opportunities to fix the essays to get an A. In-class discussions were fun. There are a lot of journals and on-line discussions, just get them done and your grade will be fine.

She is really fun and always jokes around with the class. She really challenges you to think about current issues.

She's fun in a sarcastic kind of way. She gives a lot of little assigments which is sometimes hard to keep up with if you don't pay attention. She posts everything online and she repeats it in class.
