She always had a lot of energy and made class interesting. The papers were easy and she helped every step of the way. You had do do an oral  presentation with the final paper, but it wasn't a huge part of the grade. Attendance is a biggie! And you have to have both the book and the grammar handbook. 2 thumbs up!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzOTY1Mzc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2007-10-26 00:04:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Redell is a really sweet lady; she is a retired high school teacher. All of her teaching and assignments are like the ones I did in high school. She has some kind of assignment due at every class period; so if you hated daily assignments in high school, stay away. She will drop you a letter grade for excessive absenses... don't skip!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNTYzMTc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2007-04-02 11:35:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. reddell is a really good teacher.

Grades are mostly based off of 4 different essays. Make A's on the first three and you'll be able to exempt the last one :-) There are no required books to read and the readings needed all come from the text book. I made an A in the class and would definitely take her again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNzI3OTgy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
