Class discussions were interesting. Really great sense of humor which kept class lively, and she's really pretty!

She grades really tough on papers, so if you aren't already decent at writing you shouldn't take her. If you want to improve your writing skills I would definitely recommend her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjQ1MTc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2010-12-13 16:54:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Horrible. I had to try so hard in this class to get a C. She mocked me in my papers, and I literally cried after receiving one of my papers back seeing her mocking remarks and such harsh grading. I had my papers reviewed by master degree level students and I still recieved F's on them. Horrible grader. She DEFINATELY has class favorites.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTI5NTk0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2010-11-02 02:07:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"great teacher!! really enjoyed class but she grades hard on the papers!!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzE4ODA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2010-10-31 15:04:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Enjoyable class. She has a great sense of humor and likes to joke around. Majority of class time is discussion which is nice. Gives helpful writing tips. Kinda strict on grading but you can learn from your mistakes and improve your grade. Takes attendance everyday. Peer review before each paper. Would take her for 1102.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzEzMDEw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2010-01-13 19:45:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"AWESOME teacher. Class was super fun. She makes it entertaining. Likes to joke around and lighten class. Does grade hard but its not impossible. I pulled mid B's all semester and I proofread my papers maybe twice each paper. There are 5 papers and she lets you choose your own topic so its easy to write about.

I came from &quot;Podunk&quot; Ga. and I made a 101 on one of my papers, and came out of the class with a high A. Her grading scale is steep, so if you are not a skilled writer forget about your A. She will challenge you, and you will learn a lot from her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTMzMjU3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2009-11-12 20:41:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Grades really hard!

She gives really good writing topics so the papers are not too bad to write.  There is 5 papers (one is the final).

She does not grade papers fair. She lives her dream of being a writer through you. She grades as if you are writing for a magazine company. I made a very low grade on all my papers in her class. When asking her what my final grade would be she said a B, but when grades were posted i made a D.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzEzNDk3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
