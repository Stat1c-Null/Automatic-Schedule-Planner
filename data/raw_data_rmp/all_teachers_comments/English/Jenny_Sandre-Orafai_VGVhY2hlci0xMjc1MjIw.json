It's really easy and she responds quickly to emails. There are four projects/essays and you turn them in at the end as a final portfolio. There are also some assignments from the book but they're easy. All your papers have to be on one topic so pick a good topic that has alot of good sources from the gallieo database.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzM4NTU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2010-06-02 13:45:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"You can tell she is very proud of herself as she often gloats most of the class.The Papers are very hard, basically one point off is a B. She takes off points for missing class EVEN IF ITS AN EXCUSED ABSENSE.I reported her to the chair but like always, nothing happens.BTW,finished with an 89, there every class and didn't bump me up,needs to grow up","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Mjk0NzM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG2110","date_posted":"2009-06-22 01:06:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great teacher to have. Much of the class time is spent in open debates about our reading. Participation is a must-but you'll enjoy it! She is a fair grader as long as you make an argument in the paper and have evidence to back it. She got me back into reading!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTgxMzY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
