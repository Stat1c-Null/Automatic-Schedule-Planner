A large portion of the class grade is based off of participation, so coming to class consistently is a must to pass. Still the assignments aren't difficult and if you have any questions he is more than happy to assist you after class or during his office hours.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDgzNzY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1102","date_posted":"2025-04-24 17:08:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good Professor overall, but does not give clear instructions. We didn't get any rubrics, so if you don't show up to class every day you wont know what to do.  50% of your grade is also class participation, and have 3 major writing assignments. If you need clear guidelines this is not the professor for you.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDMxNzg2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1102","date_posted":"2025-04-24 00:39:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"3 major assignments (research proposal, annotated bibliography, and 5-7 page research essay) which count for most of your grade. Several discussion posts but super easy. A few quizzes, no webcam or lockdown browser. He is somewhat a tough grader but if you ask for feedback he will give it to you.

As long as you show up to class you'll be fine. He's a funny guy + loves participation! Two major writing assignments, but he is a pretty particular grader and not entirely clear on what he wants instructions wise. The final was just showing up to class!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjI3NDc2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2024-12-26 18:38:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"\nHe makes himself available to students in person and via teams. The textbook is a free book and is available online. Ask for feedback! The rubrics are a kinda difficult to gage how well you're doing in the class so ask for feedback. Show improvement with each paper and you can make whatever grade you want. Seriously. Take him, he's awesome!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDQwNDg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2024-12-15 21:15:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take Mr. Jackson for ENG 1101 and 1102, he is the best English professor! Mr.Jackson values students' criticism and feedback as he is very determined to give the best education. He will also look over your writing assignments to point any flaws before turning it in. The course is very doable, it is two writing assignments and two presentations.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMzExNDA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2024-11-25 22:45:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Only 3 major assignments: 2 essays, 1 group presentation. The final, if there's time for it, is also a presentation that's really easy. He can read your essay and give you useful constructive criticism to help you receive the grade you want. Rarely, he gives really easy homework, otherwise I would take again. Just show up, focus, & participate.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDMyMTU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
