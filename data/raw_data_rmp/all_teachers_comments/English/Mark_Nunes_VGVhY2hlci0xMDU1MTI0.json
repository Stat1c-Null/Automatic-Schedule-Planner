He required us to read 8 novels by the end of the semester. He is one of those guys who feels his subject is the most important over all others. This must be true since everyone at SPSU goes there for an English degree. I dropped his class (so did more than half the class) because his work was too much.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTE4MTI4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2030","date_posted":"2010-02-11 14:40:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Generally nice, pretty good lecturer. you will need to the required books, and it's best to read them because he will ask you about the read material.

The A was relatively easy to obtain; a lot of grades consist of postings online (extremely easy).

I took him for American Lit 1 and the key is to go to every class and highlight every passage he reads, do all the response papers and review the highlighted passages before test.
