I barely showed up and made an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTUxNzEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2009-06-03 13:37:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Merrills was a great english teacher and also a very nice person. Her asssignments are straighforward and she was always available if we needed help. Her class was also pretty easy. Only one paper due that had to be 5 pages and everyother wednesday was online. I highly recommend her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTI3NzEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG2301","date_posted":"2006-01-11 18:55:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Merrills is a wonderful teacher, and it is easy to see that she truly loves what she is doing.
