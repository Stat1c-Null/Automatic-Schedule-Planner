I dont really like writing and would complete assignments at the last minute and pass them. She does peer reviews for papers and that was helpful because you wouldnt only have to go off her feedback. Your peers would help you improve before actually getting a grade.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Nzk3NzQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2021-05-07 15:17:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her online asynchronous class, so I don't know her well personally, but she was really nice and gave good feedback on my papers. There are three major assignments with a reflection, weekly attendance, reading assignments from the textbook, and a weekly assignment. It's not as much work as it seems, I was able to complete all hw in two hours.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzMyNjUz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
