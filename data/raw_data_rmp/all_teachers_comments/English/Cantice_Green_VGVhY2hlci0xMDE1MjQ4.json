Dr. Greene went above and beyond to support. She was always available for academic support. I enjoyed the ways instruction was articulated, elaborated, and connected with rigor, relevance, and relationship.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTEyMzEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2012-11-09 15:02:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Too much of this class was a religious discussion.

I had her fall 08 the topic was political rhetoric. I thought the class would be horrible, but it was actually fun. She is easy on grammer and looks more at content. She does not count off of a paper because you do not agree with her. I would recommend her class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzY2NTI4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2008-02-24 20:43:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"whole class is nothing but a religious debate. i didn't sign up for church. screw you.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MTE2ODk1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
