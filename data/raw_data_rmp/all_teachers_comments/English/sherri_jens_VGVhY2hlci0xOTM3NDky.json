Each paper had to be 2000 words, and while the prompts were pretty open-ended (general topic and students chose their own specific thing to write about), her grading was slow, responses vague, and lectures incredibly boring. She's also super quiet.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzM3Mjk4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2016-03-30 11:45:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"four papers that are 2000 words each.

Should be a easy A as long as you cite work in paper and correctly complete works cited page because it seems like that is the only thing she pays attention to. I submitted a paper that was almost 800 words under the minimum requirement and consisted of mostly quotes an I got a A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTIzMDUw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2015-12-14 21:34:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you aren't an English major (or other major that won't require a lot of writing), take her in a heartbeat. You won't learn anything in her class, but she is a  super easy grader - basically she just checks the citations and works cited page and skims through actual content.

Her lectures could be over with in 15 minutes, but she drags it on for the entire 3 hours. We're always off topic. If attendance wasn't mandatory, I would hardly show up. The essay topics are ridiculous (i.e. quantum mechanics). It's impossible to get a 100. However, she grades like we're fourth graders (easy).","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQ1NjUx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2015-11-04 13:25:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"I literally don't understand how she is qualified to be a professor. She rambles on and on about pointless things and she makes no sense. She's quite the free spirit which can be interesting sometimes but she assigns five 2,000 word papers which is terrible and they're all about off the wall topics like quantum physics.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQxMjcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2015-04-14 21:25:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Yes, you do have to write a lot, but it's pretty easy when you can have the writing ability of a 4th grader and still make 95's. I was in her hybrid class and there are 3 papers, 2 of them were 2000 words and the other was 1500. She let us have a partner with one of the 2000 word papers. There's also a 5 min presentation.
