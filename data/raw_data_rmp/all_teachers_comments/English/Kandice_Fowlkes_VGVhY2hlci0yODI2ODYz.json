I can see how people say her instructions are a bit confusing but honestly, if you take notes when she talks about assignments it's not too bad. She is huge on formatting. She's very personable, funny and probably one of my favorite professors at CSU.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODk0NTky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2023-03-03 19:09:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was for ENGL 1102 \nShe is incredibly vague about assignments, and explanations do not help whatsoever. I tried talking to her about assignments separately and further explanation, but I am left with more questions. Overall nice person, but not so great teacher.

She says her assignments are easy but they are hard to follow, and her instructions usually make it seem more complicated. But I enjoy her lectures and she is always willing to meet 1 on 1 to clarify if you are confused.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzQ3MjMz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
