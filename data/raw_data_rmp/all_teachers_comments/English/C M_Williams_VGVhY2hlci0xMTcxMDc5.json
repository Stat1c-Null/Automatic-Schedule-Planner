Her quizzes were not bad as long as you read the material, but her test were very hard. She is a hard grader and she cancels class without sending out emails to students. I would most likely not take her again due to the level of difficulty I had on test.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTE5MzMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2010-12-09 01:47:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a good teacher when it comes to lectures. Class discussion was only boring if you didn't participate. Her quizzes are easy if you read the material. Her test are pretty hard and she doesn't prepare you that well for them. Randomly cancels class sometimes. Great personality, but I probably wouldn't take her again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODkzMDgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2010-05-07 12:32:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"A good sign that a class is way too much is when the instructor cannot even keep up with grading the assigned work.  She has these crazily detailed rubrics that are a chore to keep up with.We had to wait forever to see our grades on everything. Semester is over,we still don't have grades on papers we turned in. She overwhelms herself!

She is an english teacher and says &quot;axe&quot; every time she wants to say &quot;ask&quot; Every assignment we do literally has to do with black rights. There is A TON OF BUSY WORK FOR HOMEWORK.

A lot of pointless homework. Does not allow you to expand and be a free thinker about your paper. She is too specific and you have to write her way. I would never recommend this teacher to anyone.

There are reading assignments every class period, writing assignments and quizzes every week, and in-class weekly writing. The 3 papers are not too bad, but the subject scope is narrow.
