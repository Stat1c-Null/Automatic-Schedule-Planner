But putting that aside, she's an great teacher. She knows what she's teaching. She's a hard grade but its because she wants you to be a great writer.

Very clear on what she wants with your essays. She really uses the textbook, so make sure you do your reading. She brings in donuts and coffee because she is amazing. She is a hilarious woman, and I enjoyed her class. Make sure you attend, though. Overall, great professor.

She is a bit unclear of what she wants until AFTER you do your first draft. That being said, she is incredibly funny (which I appreciate). Attendance is crucial (sigh), so go to class. She also holds you until the end every single time, and sometimes a little over. But, overall, she is a quality prof.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTM1MzI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2012-11-12 13:23:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Crystal is really great.

Crystal is intimidating but that's because she good at what she does. I've learned more English from her than I did all 4 years of high school. She has a background in business, & she's takes a different approach to writing. She's tough but, if you work for it, an A is achievable.
