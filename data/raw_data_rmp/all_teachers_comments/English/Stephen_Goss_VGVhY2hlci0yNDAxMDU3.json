We do lots of presentations/whole group discussion so he gives feedback in person. Must be in attendance because he barely posts online. Overall easy class, will be hard for those who cannot work with his disorganization.

He is very wise, and his class is so comforting and laid back. This class is project-heavy, but every project is enjoyable and every class is exciting. He is an amazing, respectful professor who takes the time to know each of his students, and you can tell teaching is his passion.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NzEyOTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2271","date_posted":"2022-05-02 15:02:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was organized in a very poor way. We abandoned multiple books and projects because Dr. Goss' pacing for the course was... not good. Our final projects were VERY VERY rushed as well, meanwhile other classes worked on theirs for the whole semester. Regardless, he isn't a bad person, just a bit full of himself at times and semi-neglectful.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MjEyNzgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3310","date_posted":"2022-01-24 18:29:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Goss initially appears as an incredibly kind and genuine person, but quickly revealed a disorganization and hypocrisy that greatly impacted my respect and ability to learn from him. While he emphasizes the role of student participation, his class was filled with personal anecdotes that demeaned those who participated.

In addition, it is halfway through the semester and there is not. a. single. grade. posted and NO FEEDBACK whatsoever.

Very discussion/participation heavy. No quizzes or assignments (other than light reading), all work is done in class.
