Not a huge workload, and has a very quick response time to emails. Sometimes, he gets a little behind with grading and posting assignments, but he was very helpful throughout the year and truly wants his students to succeed.

There is 1 or 2 assignments a week and 4 big papers. Although there can be limited topic choice and a bit confusing, if you ask him he will more than happy to help.
