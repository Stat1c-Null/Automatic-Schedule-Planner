The work is not difficult, but you get NO grades back until appx. halfway through semester.  When I emailed about that, she apologized but did not improve. She does give extra credit if you submit work to Smartthinking.com and implement their suggestions. Her deadlines are hard to meet. They're at 8 am, 4 pm, & 8 pm.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDgzMzgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2007-12-05 08:26:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took ecore. She is a great teacher.  Very patient and willing to help.  Always answers promptly and will take any question you have and not think it is too dumb.  Six essays and a midterm essay.  She grades very generously and if you do you work you can easily get an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNzUxMjMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2005-12-01 22:30:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Teacher is SLOW in getting back to us. When we took the midterm, we had ONE grade. When the class ended, we had 2 of 6 essays with grades. It is an ecore, so it's self taught. Plus some board creates the guidelines and requirements. Material is easy, but it's a lot of writing (duh). LOVE that the topics are limited. Would take again if I HAD to.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExMDMxNDQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true}]
