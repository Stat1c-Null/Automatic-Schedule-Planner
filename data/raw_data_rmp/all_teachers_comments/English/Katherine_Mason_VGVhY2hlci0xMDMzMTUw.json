Doesn't treat students as college-level and has grade school rules about packing up books, raising your hand etc. I found her sort of &quot;lost&quot; most of the time. Hopefully she will improve with experience. I'd guess I'd give her a second shot, but would rather not if I could avoid.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNDk2OTM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
