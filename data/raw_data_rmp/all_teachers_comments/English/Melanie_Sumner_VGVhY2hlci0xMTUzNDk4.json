She has published 2 books and is working on a third, I would have liked to take her writing class. The class was straightforward and she kept it interesting by mixing up the activities. You go to a Shakespeare play for the midterm.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Mzc1MDk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2008-12-08 15:15:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice and very smart, but totally clueless about students cheating on her weekly reading quizes.
