You have to analyze each piece thoroughly via vista or essay test. Take in person, not online! (speaking directly to mature audiences or those who may have a huge class load)However, instructor very helpful and approachable.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzkzODYx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL4460","date_posted":"2011-12-16 20:24:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Barrier responds to email quickly but doesn't really follow through on what he says he will do. There are several things that he says he will post that he hasn't posted yet and grades already posted. Read all the material.

Loves his work but shy in front of the class. Teaches very quietly. LOTS of reading, all from an anthology that might break your wrists. Some interesting pieces, a lot of boring ones. Two big tests.

There were two tests (both had an essay portion worth 50pts) as well as a final project, and regular WebCT responses to the reading. This class was very time consuming and seemed to last forever. It was a fairly easy A, but oh my gosh was it boring.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDU5MzEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2160","date_posted":"2009-05-12 20:10:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice guy, but really needs to speak up. Voice is very soft and somewhat monotone. He is really nice about his test, though they are not always easy. At the end, he allowed us to do an online make-up for each, but is full of random info on the authors covered in section.

I found him easy to track down and happy to meet outside class. Read the assignments, participate in class discussion and post on Vista and you'll do fine.

Super nice man, but not good for an online class. Take someone else. His test instructions are so confusing and frustrating, you waste all your time trying to read his mind.
