The final is a re-write of any essay you choose. He isn't always the clearest on what he wants in his essays. He is funny at times, and then there are times in his class that he says a little too much. There are pop quizzes over the readings but not many.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzQxMDk0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2009-11-05 11:12:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Somewhat easy. Isn't really clear on exactly what he wants in his papers. 4 papers the whole year. Exam is a revised essay. Not too hard but he expects you to do your homework and to do the papers...on time. I would take him again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzE4NjUx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2009-11-05 00:41:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher! He only gives 4 papers for the whole year and the Exam at the end of the semester is simply to revise one of your former papers you have already written. He is helpful and funny at times. I recommend his class to anyone!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzE3MzE0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
