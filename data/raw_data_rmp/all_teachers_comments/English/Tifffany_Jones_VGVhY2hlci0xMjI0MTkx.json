Every essay you get back she has labored over, and it's always full of helpful remarks, constructive criticism about what's wrong, and (most importantly) encouraging comments about what you've done right.  I'm still looking for a 1102 professor that is as good.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTY1MDQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2009-05-31 21:44:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"she likes certain people hates others...if ur a really good brown noser go for it. it is a really hard to get in touch with her too","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1OTE4MDkz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2009-04-23 10:15:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Gives only 3 essays and a group project the whole semester.

If you ask her for help with a paper she will help you a lot. She teaches at KSU and another college so she grades pretty slow. gives 3 essays and 2 timed writings. many people didnt do too well on her essays. she takes high regard to class parcipation and effort. not the best, not nearly the worst. i would take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MTQyNTU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
