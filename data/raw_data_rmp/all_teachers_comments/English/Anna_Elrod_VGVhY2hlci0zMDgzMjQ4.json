We had three papers for the whole semester and a few quizzes. The quizzes are about the content in class and aren't lockdown browser. I recommend coming to majority of the semester because we usually have a class activity everyday for a participation grade. Other than that, shes chill and offers extra credit.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODgwNDg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2025-03-26 22:02:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed Professor Elrod's class. She grades well and isn't super picky. It is easy to cushion your grade with a lot of 100%s if you come to class and do the in class assignments. A little bit harsher grader on major assignments, but not bad. Kind and funny, but does not take likely to students talking during class, she would call them out.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODIzNDQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
