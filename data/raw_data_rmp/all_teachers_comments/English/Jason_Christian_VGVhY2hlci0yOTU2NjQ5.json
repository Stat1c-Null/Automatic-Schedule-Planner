He is the best English professor I've had in a while. He loves what he teaches and makes sure to help you in anyway he can. There is one group project that's worth 10% of your grade, but everything else is on you. If you have any issues with anything he will help you! Always makes class interesting, and I always leave knowing more.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTc5NjE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2025-04-15 20:07:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher!
