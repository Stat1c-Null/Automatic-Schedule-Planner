Couldn't access assignments after the due date. Problem with an assignment? couldn't see until after you got a 0. wouldn't take credit if there was a problem because it was \"too late\" after she gave a 0. save yourself and pick someone else.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTQ1ODYx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2025-04-04 02:05:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awful!

I'm one of the lucky ones but after that its basically impossible to get an A in a class. It was like a lot of busy work but none of it was too hard.
