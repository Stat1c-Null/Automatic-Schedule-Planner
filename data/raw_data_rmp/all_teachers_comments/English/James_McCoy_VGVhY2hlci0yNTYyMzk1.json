He is seriously the sweetest man. Only 3 essays and some little free writes. If you need to be in a class that has structure, dont take him. He is an amazing professor but his D2L and his assignments are all over the place, lol.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzU0NDk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2021-12-18 06:42:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is the easiest class I have ever and will ever take. He is so sweet and a really easy grader. Only thing is, he doesn't put grades in D2L and his due dates are sometimes confusing. We had 3 essays and some free writes, but none of it is too bad.

As long as you do the occasional reading from the textbook and write the three papers for the class, you'll get an A. Deadlines are flexible and he never penalized us for late work.

He didn't know how to work the discussion board, so we had to send him emails. He usually responds within a few days at most. He's very understanding about COVID.
