Clearly organized, very clear rubrics & guidelines for papers, & interesting topics to choose to write on. Pretty easy quiz from the reading every week. Discussions & blog posts are usually weekly, but they are easy As. Do the work & you can easily make an A!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTEzMDQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2014-12-05 23:20:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"She knows what she's talking about, the class was overall incredibly easy. You turn papers in every other Friday via email and you don't have to show up to class. Easiest class I have ever taken. Bourdeau is a sweet person, she talks a lot about things that don't matter (her personal life, cat pictures, etc..) but she tries to make the class fun","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzOTY1ODQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
