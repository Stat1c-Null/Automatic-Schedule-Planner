The assignments he gave were challenging in all the right ways, but not too hard. He's a published author, and therefore very qualified to teach the class.

His lectures are very long winded, and at times it comes across as him just listening to his own voice. For a writing class (this being the 4th that I've taken) it was pretty garden-variety.
