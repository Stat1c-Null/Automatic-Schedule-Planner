If you enjoy writing even a little then this will be a breeze--otherwise the writing center is always there for you. Pacing/expectations were very reasonable. They were always open to answering questions before/after classes too.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODUwNzU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2021-12-13 16:18:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall Prof. Conte is really great. Their grading system allows for everyone to do well. The assignments can seem challenging at first, but trust me, they're not that bad. Also, the textbook technically IS mandatory, however in my class we didn't use it that much, so hold off on getting it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDk1OTE4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGLISH1101","date_posted":"2021-12-02 16:42:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Conte was an amazing teacher. They care about your mental health and are very attentive to your every need. The class was enjoyable even at 8:00 am. I really did learn and improve in this course. The grading was awesome, even if you may fail an essay etc, there is room to improve your grade in other areas. Overall, great professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzQ2NjM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
