This class was the best. Despite all the difficult times that Parker was going through, we still had fun. Buy ALL the books. You will need them.

She wants you to write what you think and feel. No holding back. She grades mostly on the effort and thought behind the paper; grammar is only considered when it gets distracting. No textbook!
