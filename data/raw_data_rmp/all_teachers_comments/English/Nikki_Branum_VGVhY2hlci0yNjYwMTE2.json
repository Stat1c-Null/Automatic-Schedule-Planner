She is amazing at what she does, even from through a screen. Had her my first year both semesters for BOTH 1101 &amp; 1102 classes. Made an A in both. Quite minimal textbook use, if you ever need anything, just ask! Seriously! She's incredibly generous and understanding if you work with her. She cares about your understanding &amp; grades equally","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjUxMzg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
