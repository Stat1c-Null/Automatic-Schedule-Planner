However, there are many group activities in class that allow students to get to know each other and get a break from just power points.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzM5MTA3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2016-12-04 00:32:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do NOT take Professor Gennetti only once a week! He never assigned us any work during the week through email or D2L before class met again. We only ever did work in class and only wrote 1 paper out of class. Don't feel like I got everything I could have out of this class with my writing. Otherwise he's really nice though and a good teacher in class","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzIzNzc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2016-05-12 21:41:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"You get extra credit for going to the writing center.  One long research essay with easy audio visual presentation.  A couple of short essays.  He is very helpful and there are peer reviews to help with your drafts/papers.

He's kinda goofy and sometimes the instructions weren't completely clear but he's a very understanding professor. Would probably recommend, because the class wasn't difficult at all.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTU2MDky","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2016-01-26 16:27:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was really quirky which was funny but helpful and nice. 4 papers and the final is a paper. He gives pop quizzes but if you read they aren't hard, he let us retake a couple. I didn't think he was a super tough grader and he always gave good feedback, plus if you go to writing center you can get a little extra credit! Wouldn't mind taking again(:","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTk1NjE0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2016-01-18 21:43:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor, I would take again. There's a journal every week on D2L. There are five pop quizzes the whole semester and four essays. He adds two extra points on your essay if you go to the writing center. Also, there's lots of reading that one would have to do.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTU5NjAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2015-10-27 11:49:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really good teacher. He was young so i was weary about taking him but after he got comfortable teaching he got better. Really helpful and will direct you to places where you can find help (WRITING CENTER IS BEST FRIEND). Gives great feedback on paper. He gives a lot of papers but that is because he doesn't have test.
