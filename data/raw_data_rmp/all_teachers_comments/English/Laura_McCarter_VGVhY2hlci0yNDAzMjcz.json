She gives three essays over film analysis that are super easy. She gives you the freedom to pick what films you want to write about. She provides great feedback and is a pretty fair grader.

There were three major papers as well as a final video essay based on our choice of movies. Although very easy, the class allowed me to solidify and strengthen my writing skills.
