Being fresh out of HS, I had to bend over backwards with all her writing. I did indeed hate her class for a bit, but you really get responsible and learn a lot from the lady. She's extremely good at her job, and I really wish I could've fit her into my schedule.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzIyMjEx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1001","date_posted":"2010-01-11 00:24:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"very good teacher but lots of work...she came in to class seemingly high on cough syrup which was very funny. really takes the time to read the work that you do but its alot fo work. take her she will make you learn!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzA2Njg4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2131","date_posted":"2009-12-23 08:51:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is fabulous & is always responsive to questions (in class & via email). It is a lot of writing (& reading) & if you don't like to write, do not take this class. It is also too much like a history class, so if you are looking for traditional literature, this is not it; however, I did develop more appreciation for this because of her ethusiasm.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NjI5NDQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2131","date_posted":"2009-12-06 19:35:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"If not too much reading then far too much writing, not including the research project and the poetry project.
