He is super sweet and knows the material he is teaching. If you do end up taking him, do not slack off. You will need to read a lot of material, and I am guilty of not doing this.

He makes huge groups of 6-7 people and forces them to collectively write a one-page paper every single week. This is WAY too many people and everyone is miserable!

Never pronounced my name correctly, but he's too cute of an old man to correct. Graded on three things: midterm, long seminar paper, and a final. That's it.
