Just turn in college-level papers and you are bound to get 100s on every assignment. The only thing that was a bit annoying is that he never gave feedback on the papers and the in-class sessions were extremely unproductive. But other than that he is a cool guy","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjQzMTAz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2021-04-15 17:39:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Allentini was amazing for me this semester. Super nice guy, loves to chat, and never held us longer than an hour in the class. Obviously since it is an english class you have to write papers, but he is not the kind of prof to take points off because of something super subjective. Very empathetic and understanding about the pandemic.

He graded everyone's first paper wrong, then when someone emailed him about it, he went back into that person's paper and marked on it more. He is very difficult to work with, and very lazy.
