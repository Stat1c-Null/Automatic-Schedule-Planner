Nothing too complicated or terrible. If you have questions she is always there to help; if you need an extension just reach out. I would definitely recommend this course.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzUyNTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-12-15 06:27:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet and gave great feedback!
