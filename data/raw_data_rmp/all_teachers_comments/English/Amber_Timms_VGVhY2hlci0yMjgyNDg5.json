In my class, you got to choose your topic and got to write about it for the entire semester. I loved how she did not force us to write about something we did not care about. I would take her again.

I took her for 1101 and 1102 and she's amazing. If you put forth some effort and ask her for feedback you should do well on essays. If you miss more than 5 classes, you fail the class (the dept.'s rule, not her's).","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTE1Mjcw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2017-12-11 14:35:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Timms is a really good professor. She's actually helpful when you ask her questions and gives great feedback on papers. She'll let you revise all of them but the final one. I actually enjoyed her class because she was funny and almost always kept it short. If you don't like working with random people, beware. She breaks us into groups often.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTMxODY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMP1101","date_posted":"2017-12-11 07:27:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Timms is awesome! She really wants you to do well and creates a very relaxed class, she even said multiple times during the semester she doesn't want her class to create any stress. She always has funny stories to tell in class and lets you speak your mind.
