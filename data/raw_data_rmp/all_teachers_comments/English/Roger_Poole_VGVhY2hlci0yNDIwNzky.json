According to his feedback he can seem like a tough grader, but as long as you do what you're supposed to you will do well in his class. Some of the weekly assignments are in-class so attendance is madatory. The rest are due Sunday night. He's a funny dude &amp; talks a lot.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzA0ODk5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2019-05-09 19:53:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"This teacher is a lame excuse for an English teacher. He acts like he nice, caring, and a good teacher, but remember its all an act. His teaching skills probably would be good if he actually used them. Doesnt respond to emails at all. You can show hard work and he still wont reward you anything. He grades hard,DO NOT TAKE.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODI3NzU5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He will give you zero on work that you followed his guidelines for. He brings you in to class to waste time with his busy work you could be doing some other time or not at all. He is just the overall worst teacher and person at KSU. Dont take his 1101 English either he sucks at both.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODI1MDQ1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He is very unclear on what he is looking for in essays and his rubrics are lacking in detail. He does not have very much respect for students either.

The worst I have experienced in my career as a student and I am particularly off put because I am pursuing a career in education myself. Poole refuses to teach and uses class time to set students onto busy work, while telling students to look up what to do whenever they have questions. He didn't even know what third person meant.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDU3Mzg2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2018-11-07 14:36:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Three main papers (one of them is the final). He really prepares you for writing it, allows for peer reviews, often has Sunday assignments (reflections usually on an article). Really interesting topics for papers; keeps class interesting.
