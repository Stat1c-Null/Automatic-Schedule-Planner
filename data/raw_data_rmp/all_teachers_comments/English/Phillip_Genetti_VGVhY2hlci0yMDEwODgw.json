Only 1 major essay with a couple small assignments and we watched a few movies too.

He did not post a syllabus, nor did he answer emails. There are two essays, both very easy. Just show up and participate. Very frustrating at times, but simple. Nice guy.

You could tell he enjoyed what he was doing and wanted his students to succeed. Lectures could be a bit boring sometimes. As long as you do the reading and pay attention to the feedback he gives on papers, it's a pretty easy pass.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzAyMTM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2016-12-01 10:08:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Genetti was by far one of my favorite English teachers. He exceeds at making the class enjoyable because of his attitude, jokes, and passion for writing and literature. Also, he teaches in depth, provides many examples, and conducts in-class group activities, which is very helpful. Only had 3 papers! Would definitely recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Mjk2NzU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENLG1101","date_posted":"2016-11-02 20:20:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor G is really laid back, and he carries this cool encyclopedia case that you should ask him about. He also brings his guitar and plays for class sometimes. Gives breaks during class, but most of the time we don't stay the full 2 hours and 45 minutes. Only wrote 2 papers.

He is very humorous during his lectures. He allows us to have breaks during class (I have a 2 hr 45 min class), and sometimes dismisses us early. The assignments are easy in my opinion. His grading is fair. If you come to class, you will do well.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDgyMjk0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2016-08-15 22:14:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Genetti is one of the best professors i've ever taken in college. Took him for both 1101 and 1102, and his class is such an enjoyable experience. Assignments are pretty easy, the class flies by, and he is a really nice person. He gets your brain thinking in a writing way that lasts beyond his class as well. 259","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODk3NDE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2016-04-27 14:47:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Genetti is one of the best teachers I have had this semester. He is really funny and sarcastic and majority of the time we didn't have to stay the whole class period (3 hour class). The whole semester we had to turned little things into D2L but they were easy.

I enjoyed this past semester so much that I am taking him again for 1102. Only had a couple papers that were a few paragraphs long. I really appreciated him sitting down with each of us after he handed back a paper and going over where we could improve.
