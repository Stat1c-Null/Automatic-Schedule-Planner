However, I believe that it was possibly one of the easiest English classes I could have taken. Grades on papers are based mostly on content and thought. Show up and follow directions and an A is reasonably attainable. As well, his humor is occasionally entertaining.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NzExODkz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2011-11-29 15:27:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's an alright professor.

I took him for 1101 and 1102. His class can be kind of boring, but only if you don't engage yourself in his discussions. He wants to &quot;expand your awareness&quot; and if you just participate in class you'll find that he will do just that.
