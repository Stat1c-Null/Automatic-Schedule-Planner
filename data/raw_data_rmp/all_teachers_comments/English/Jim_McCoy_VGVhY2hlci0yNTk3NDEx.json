Only had to write 3 easy papers for the whole semester. Attendance was graded each week by just emailing him a question abt the assignment given. You need the textbook for the assignment given but can find it for free online.

He'll talk about bs for 30 min. Not an exaggeration. There's tons of one-page &quot;papers&quot; that you have to do that he doesn't take up. There's no helpful feedback on the papers you do turn in. The most interesting class was when we watched a video for the whole class.
