I am majoring in English Education and struggled to make a B-. She gives pretty easy work, but her instructions are impossible to understand and when you ask her questions the answers leave you even more confused than before. Avoid this teacher at all costs, there are so many better English professors!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NTEzMTUy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2008-05-08 12:55:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"I personally liked Dr. Broughton. She does play favorites, but its not hard to become one of her favorites. Just do the work and you'll do fine. I took her for both ENGL 1101 and 1102, got B's both times. The people leaving negative comments are probably lazy or excessively use &quot;like&quot; between every other word.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NDI5MTg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2008-01-09 20:24:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor I've ever had. Any time I heard people talking about her it had to do with how mean she was or how her assignment instructions were impossible to unriddle. Every Monday and Wednesday I dreaded coming into school because of this class. She's rude and impatient and generally makes you want to stab yourself in the forehead. Avoid.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzOTczMzc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2007-11-12 17:26:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is rude.

Completely and totally unfair. I was out a day because my 9 year old brother was having seizures and she told me that that was not excuse. She was also extremely rude.
