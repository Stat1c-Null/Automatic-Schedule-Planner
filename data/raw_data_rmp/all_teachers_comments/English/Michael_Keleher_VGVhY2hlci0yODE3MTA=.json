He gives you as many chances to rewrite your paper as you want. And he TELLS you exactly what to fix. He listens to both sides of an argument and he isn't bias when it comes to argumentative essays. He reads it for quality and doesnt give a bad grade just because he doesnt agree with your view point. I really enjoyed his class and there are many engaging class discussions. He makes you work, but thats so you are prepared for the next level.
