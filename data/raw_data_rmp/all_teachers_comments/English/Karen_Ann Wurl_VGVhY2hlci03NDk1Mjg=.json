If you have the opportunity to take her consider yourself very fortunate!!!! TAKE HER CLASS!!!! We had 5 grades 1 paper, 3 test, and attendance. She goes over what is important about the test the class before so all you have to do is take notes and you can easily make an A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzY0NzU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Means well for all, but class is slightly boring! Watch a movie, read a couple of books, but mainly all we did ALL semester was write 1 paper, and she stretched it out over the whole semester. But I would reccomend her, she's a lil quirky, but most english teachers are. She is very nice and understanding!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNDA5MjQw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2007-01-03 13:04:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"her tellings and doings are not matched at the end of semester.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNzE0NTI5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
