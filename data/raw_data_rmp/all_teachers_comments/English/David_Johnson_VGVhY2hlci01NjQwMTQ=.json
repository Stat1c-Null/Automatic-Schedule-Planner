He has a sense of humor, and he will share some jokes at the beginning of class which pertain to language and linguistics.  Dr. Johnson is fair, intelligent, knowledgeable, up front, he engages the class in interesting discussions, will quiz, and he is organized. Recommended.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NjIwNjIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2271","date_posted":"2008-04-30 12:14:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher.  Very understanding if you had to be out.  Grades very fair.  Assignments not too hard, but there is a lot of work and reading.  I would take him again.

I think on the surface Dr. Johnson appears somewhat nice, but when communicating with him on a one on one basis, I found him to be cold and distant.  I would not take him again.  At times I felt extremely uncomfortable around him, and he seemed to have 'favorite' students.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MzU3MDY2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3035","date_posted":"2008-04-15 10:36:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Johnson was a great teacher!
