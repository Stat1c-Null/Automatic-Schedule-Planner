He really cares about you and wants you to succeed. He grades a little tough and gives pop quizzes often, but if you do your work they aren't hard at all. HIGHLY recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTU5Njcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGLISH1101","date_posted":"2014-01-09 19:10:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Lopos is very nice and willing to help you with your writing but his help is honestly useless. He grades very hard on papers and gives random pop quizzes. He grades papers based on grammar (ALOT) and his opinion of it. I consistently got b's on mine and asked for help on how to improve but still didn't help.

However, this class is really difficult mostly due to the confusion he causes. Never clear on assignments, you pretty much have to email him every time to clarify. Grades pretty harshly on papers, you cannot BS them. They need to be very thought provoking for him to approve, not just factual.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODIxNDk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2012-02-27 12:34:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is the funniest teacher I've ever had but, I would not recommend his class. He is not clear at all when explaining assignments and often does not post anything online. There are a few papers I wrote that were never graded because the other students couldn't understand the assignment (I couldn't much either)but I don't like wasting time.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5ODYxMjc2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2010-04-27 21:22:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"By far the smartest and funniest man alive. he makes you work for your grade but you definatly try harder to impress him.
