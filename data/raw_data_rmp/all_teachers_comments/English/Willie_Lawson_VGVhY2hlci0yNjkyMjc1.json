If no one talks he wont teach he will just punish you in writing a 500 word essay due at the end of class. Expects you to teach yourself. Never gave any good lectures. I wanted to be taught, not read from a book.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1ODM2MjYx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2021-12-11 02:04:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"Participation really matters. He gives essays on a topic that nobody hardly knows if nobody decides to participate in class. He only began to try and give feedback towards the end of the semester. Only four essays, and a bunch of discussion posts that you will not know the grade of. He also takes forever to grade anything.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NDY2NjUw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2021-11-02 15:49:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Lawson is awesome. Great lectures and not a lot of homework. 4 major assignments. It's super important to get feedback from him before you turn in your papers, otherwise you probably won't do too well. He offers a good amount of extra credit, so even if you don't do as well as you want, you can save your grade. Would take again","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTc5Mzk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENFLISH1101","date_posted":"2021-11-02 00:00:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is the worst class I have taken. He shows up late to class and expects you to have the assignment done before you leave and wont give you extra time. He also gives horrible feedback on papers and grades very harshly. He also doesnt reply to emails and helps you work and fix your grade.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTc2OTk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2021-11-01 23:41:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gives ZERO feedback on your essays so don't count on any feedback to help you fix your mistakes. He also doesn't put in your discussion grades so you will never know your actual grade. We usually have weekly discussions which are due either before or when class is over. I don't recommend Mr. Lawson if you wan't to pass go with another professor","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTc2OTE0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2021-10-07 21:17:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"he goes into depth with his lectures, gives good feedback on essays/drafts, three papers throughout the course, &amp; weekly discussions. overall, all you need to do in order to pass is pay attention and keep up with due dates. he's very open-minded and likes for the class to participate in class. i highly recommend him if you like interactive classes!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTEwMzk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Amazing lectures--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMP1102","date_posted":"2021-05-08 04:32:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fun professor really understanding and is NOT a tyrant when comes to due dates. The class was very informative and the professor is young so he related to the students very well. Overall a really smart guy and is helpful when you dont understand.
