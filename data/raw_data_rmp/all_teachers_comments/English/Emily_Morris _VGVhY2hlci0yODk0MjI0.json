She is super kind and is there to help you with anything. People say she is a harsh grader, but if you ask her to revise your essay and go to the writing center, you can get an A on every essay. Attendance is mandatory, but all the classwork is an easy A.

She really loves her job and students. There are three major essays and in-class work on most days, so I would say attendance is mandatory. You can compare her style of teaching to a high school class, but she is efficient. She responds quickly to emails and is easy to get in contact.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzM5MDQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2023-11-03 12:51:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Morris is a wonderful professor and makes everything simple to understand.
