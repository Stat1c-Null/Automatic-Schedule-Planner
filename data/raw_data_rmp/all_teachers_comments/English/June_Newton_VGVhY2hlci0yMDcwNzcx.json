You are not allowed to speak in her class or use your phone for any resources. She will fail you for the day if you use your phone. There is also a lot of reading she assigns after every class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NTg0ODEy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2017-12-18 17:06:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Newton is a great instructor.

There are 2 books, but you really only NEED one of them. She will occasionally give pop quizzes over the book that are usually hit or miss.
