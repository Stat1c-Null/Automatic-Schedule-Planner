There are about 4 big papers we had to write, but they were not long or difficult. It was a pretty easy class and I would take her again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODM0Nzc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2014-01-02 11:32:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"The course is pretty straightforward. There are several essays that you will have to write. There is a lot of participation. Also, you will work on essays in class before it's due, like peer editing, so there's no surprise due dates. Textbook isn't crucial, but its useful and she expects you to read it. Show up to class, and you'll pass.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjg0Mzgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2013-06-17 20:53:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was a very helpful professor. I made a B in the class and was very surprised! I participated a lot  in class the first half of the semester and then I stopped talking as much because she pissed me off. Take her if you're shy.

You have to do the work in her class. You are allowed to miss three days. You do have a dicussion grade for this professor, the discussions are either online or in class. She is a very nice lady and kinda of corky but in a good way. Class has some boring moment.

Her homework assignments are easy enough if you follow her instructions, but her methods of grading are weird (eg. giving assignments that are not going to be graded.)","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMzA4NjMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2011-04-13 12:32:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet lady, but she is not necessarily the easiest teacher. You need to go to class and pay attention. She is good at explaining her assignments, but sometimes grades in confusing ways.

As long as you go to class, actually follow the assignment description and have the writing lab check over your papers you will get an A.
