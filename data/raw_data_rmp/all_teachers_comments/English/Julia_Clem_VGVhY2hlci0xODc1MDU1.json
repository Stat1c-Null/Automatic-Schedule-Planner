I have might high C's and low B's on all papers. I go to the writing center and it still does not improve the grading. She makes it seem like it is so easy but it is not. She doesn't really give you a clarity on what she exactly wants in the paper. We get off topic a lot so class isn't so boring","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDYyMjU5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1102","date_posted":"2014-02-16 21:44:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is not difficult, the papers are not difficult, understanding what to do for them is. She is terrible at clarifying what needs to be done in order to receive a decent grade. Her \"guides\" posted online are poor at explaining as well. She is a sweet lady, but her explaining is disgusting.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyODQ1NDY4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGLISH1101","date_posted":"2014-01-15 17:45:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Younger, so she relates to the students easier. Tries to make class fun instead of just the same old same. Uses the book every class, so buy/rent it! I took all Gen. Ed. classes last semester, and this was my favorite by far. Only failed because of the attendance policy, so definitely go to class! Highly reccomend her!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNzU3NTMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Fail","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
