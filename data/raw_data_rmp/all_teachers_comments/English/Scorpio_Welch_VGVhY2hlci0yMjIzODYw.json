She is very interactive with her students! This is an EASY A class !!!!! If you are a day or 2 or maybe even a week late on turning in the assignment she will easily open it back up on D2L for you to turn in. I'm also taking her ENGL1102 as well!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTc2OTk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2017-03-20 19:19:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Welch is okay. As long you do the assignments, you'll be just fine. Sometimes the wording of her assignments can be confusing, but she'll make it clear to you if you ask questions. There will be a class groupme so she'll inform you if she will be late, won't be in class, or answer any questions you may have. Pretty chill professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTI1MTA3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2017-01-08 19:38:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Welch is a teacher that everyone loves. She is vague on instructions but is an easy grader. She cares about her class and her assignments are very out of the box. Her class is only once a week(2 1/2 hours on fridays) and you only truly stay for about 35 minutes. Keep in mind this class is basically online and getting help can be difficult","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njk1MzQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
