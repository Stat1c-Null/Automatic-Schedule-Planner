Most if not all of his lectures were just him rambling about a topic he chose which was barely related to the passage we were assigned. There were only eight assignments, four quizzes, and four papers. He graded the papers very harshly. He gave some okay feedback for them but it was mostly \"develop this more\".","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NTA1Mjc2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2021-03-24 16:02:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Be prepared to never get an A on anything in this class. He seems like a really caring person but never gave any clear direction on what he wanted you to do on assignments. You're 100% better off just picking a different professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDY5MDQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2017-05-09 21:25:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Vague prompts mixed with very low quality feedback and response along with slow grading time makes for a difficult class with only three essays and some quizzes. If you do poorly on one essay it is pretty much impossible to get higher than a B in the class no matter how well you do on the last two.  Lectures consist of rambling most of the time.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjY2MTI0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2009-07-12 14:46:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Johnson is probably one of the worst teachers I have had in my life. He is a tough grader and his grading standards are too high and demanding. He is also very boring and his teaching skills are garbage.

He will look at your papers before grading if you e-mail and ask for advice.  Do your readings and turn work in on time and you will be ok.

He was boring at a time, but not a lot of work. There are 2 tests (home take), 1 paper (5 pages only and you got to pick your own topic), 3 quizzes (that actually help a lot.) He is a good guy, just kinda boring. Do your reading, pay more attention on tests and you will be fine.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNjc0NTYw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2110","date_posted":"2005-12-10 11:22:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"lots of reading...LOTS of reading!
