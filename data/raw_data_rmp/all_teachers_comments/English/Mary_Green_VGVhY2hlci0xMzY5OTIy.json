Especially when they're taking online courses.. So, instead of making discussions due each week, she allows everyone to do them at their own convenience as long as it is done by a certain date at the end of the semester. Great teacher.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMzc3MDAy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3800","date_posted":"2018-05-30 11:54:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Green is wonderful! Her online course was pretty straightforward, and consisted of a few open-book tests, a couple papers, and discussion boards, all fairly easy. Reading the book wasn't necessary, but I did use it on the exams. She responds to emails and questions very quickly. Taking her again for LDRS 3000. I definitely recommend her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMjA5NDk2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3000","date_posted":"2017-12-18 00:39:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof Green is so nice! Her class is super easy. She has a lot of discussion posts but leaves them open all semester and you basically just have to write a sentence and she will give you a 100. She always leaves positive feedback on all assignments and actually reads the papers you write, but she still always gives 100s. Take her for a gpa booster!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjUyNTA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3800","date_posted":"2017-04-09 22:50:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Green is great!  She opens up the discussion boards the whole semester and you basically have the whole semester to finish.  Tests are not hard and she doesn't post much.  She is very accessible via e-mail.
