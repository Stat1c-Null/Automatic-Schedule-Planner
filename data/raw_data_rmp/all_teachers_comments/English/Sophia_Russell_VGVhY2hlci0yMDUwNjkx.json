Class is mostly discussion of the powerpoints and peer review. It's a reasonable class. Show up to the review meetings. She's very helpful in that. You're going to pass if you show up.

Professor isn't too helpful but is understanding. Standard amount of work for an English class. Didn't really cover much material in class, but she gives clear instructions on important assignments.

That's probably why I never showed up. You never know what you'll be doing in class ahead of time. To be honest she makes English 1101 harder than it needs to be.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MTg2ODcy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2016-01-11 18:56:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"She wasn't the most helpful teacher ever but she tried and she was super sweet. She used to be a high school teacher and luckily she grades like one. Easy A on papers. Most people in the class were slackers and took advantage of it and ended up failing because they didn't ever complete the papers. Great teacher. Don't listen to bad reviews on her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTIxMTk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2016-01-07 23:32:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Russell is the worst English professor I've ever taken. Her grading criteria was not clear and she did not give straight answers when you ask for help. She grades papers by running them through a grammar site and basing it solely on that. She is not helpful and I did not learn anything in the class. Would not recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTAwNDIw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2015-12-30 01:19:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her lectures are boring and her voice is very monotone, but she is a very sweet lady.

I had AP and honors classes, and I've become a better writer with her techniques. You will learn, no doubt about that. You just have to pay attention and do your part. She was new this semester and had issues with D2L, but she's very clear. Explains in class and posts to d2l. She even accepts work after the due date.
