I loved her class so much because she was willing to work with us and give us some wiggle room when it came to assignments. All of her assignments, quizzes, and tests were online so that was definitely a plus for me. I couldn't have asked for a better professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODQ4ODgz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Get ready to read--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2017-01-07 14:57:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you're looking for an easy english class to take take Washington!!!
