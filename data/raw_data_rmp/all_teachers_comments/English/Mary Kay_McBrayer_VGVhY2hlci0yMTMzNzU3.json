There's 1 group project. Her grading criteria is semi clear for assignments. She tells you not to use \"is\" on essays. My father who majored in journalism thought that was an absurd writing requirement, but it's her standard. Overall medium workload and she always answers questions.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzkxNTkz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--Skip class?

She keeps class entertaining & loves participation. Gives a good bit of reading but the pieces are usually short & interesting.
