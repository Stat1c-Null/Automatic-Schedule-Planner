He has tough guidelines as far as accountability for assignments and class attendance, but I find them reasonable now compare to work deadlines and such. Participation matters in this class. Progress only develops with practice and critical observation of our work and others.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MzA4NzQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CREATIVEWRITIN","date_posted":"2013-10-04 16:56:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Creative Writing with him when he taught at Illinois State University. He would tear apart my work but didn't give guidance. He made you feel like you were a terrible writer but didn't show you how to get better. He counted tardies like absences and graded harshly on them. I learned nothing from him except how to be a bad professor.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTU3NDcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WRIT3100","date_posted":"2011-05-05 20:05:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"I dropped his class after the first day. His attendance policy is that he drops a letter grade for every absence. No excuses. If there is a death he will consider excusing the absence. He seemed pretty ridiculous to me. He also seemed to have A TON of assignments due each week. I wouldn't take him again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTM3NDM4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STUDYABRO","date_posted":"2010-08-06 16:53:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"study abroad with this professor!
