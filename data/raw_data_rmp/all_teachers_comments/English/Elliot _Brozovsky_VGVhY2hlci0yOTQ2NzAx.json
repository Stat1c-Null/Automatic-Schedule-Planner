From the beginning of his classes, you can tell that he truly cares for his students and their growth. There are 4 major projects, but each one has assignments that build up to it. He makes class very engaging, & he's very considerate. If you need to take English 1101, DEFINITELY pick Mr.B!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMzE4MzEw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2024-10-23 20:08:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor B is amazing and you can tell he cares about his students and work. I really enjoyed the many different creative outlets he lets you explore through homework/projects, it made the class so much more enjoyable. For attendance, you get 6 freebies and then it starts to count against you, and also he yaps a lot (I still love him).
