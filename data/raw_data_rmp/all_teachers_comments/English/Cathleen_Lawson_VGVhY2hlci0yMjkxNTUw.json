She is extremely nice and lenient and understanding to an extent. While the class is on the tougher side, if you do the work and ask questions when necessary, you will do fine.

There's a lot of online discussions about the assigned essays to read. Required to write two essays during the semester. A fair grader. As long as you do the work correctly, and ask questions.

For a teacher that talks about coherence all the time, she should really make her class a little coherent.
