It's an easy class if you show up and do all the work. He's a funny guy, challenges you to think abstractly but at the end of the day, his opinion will dictate discussions","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTkzODUx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2012-09-19 00:56:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is not helpful at all.

Okay teacher, but by no means great. Tells you not to \"kiss the dummy\" but grades you poorly if you don't.

He uses a lot of funny videos to help teach. Fall 2011 was his first semester here but he was at SCAD before. I really liked him and as long as you keep trying on the papers, you will get a good grade :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDE1MzUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
