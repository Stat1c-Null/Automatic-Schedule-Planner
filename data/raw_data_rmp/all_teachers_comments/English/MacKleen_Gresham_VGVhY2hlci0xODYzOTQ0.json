I had her for learning support and 1101 and she is just amazingggg. Not everyone can teach and make you understand, but she does make sure that you understand everything and her tests. papers and homeworks are easy. You have to write your essays in order to get a grade in 1101 because that's what its all about.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDQyNTc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2015-03-27 12:48:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Lots of in-class peer reviews. Willing to help if you put in the effort. Assigns readings for homework and has you write your opinion on it on discussion board. Likes to go over reading for class discussion. No final.

I was hesitant about taking her course once I read the previous rate my professor reviews. Boy am I glad that I did take her class though, because I truly am a better writer now. I know how to argue, and I am so ready for round two in ENGL1102.
