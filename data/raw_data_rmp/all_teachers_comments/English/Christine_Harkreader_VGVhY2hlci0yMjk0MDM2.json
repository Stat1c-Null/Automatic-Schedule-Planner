My first essay grade was low but that was honestly my fault for not following the directions. MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW DIRECTIONS, that's all I'm saying. Everything you need to do is on D2L and she also answers emails or will even meet with you. I did learn a lot.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NDc1NjE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-12-07 23:43:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great professor who genuinely cares about helping her students and you can tell she wants the best for you and your writing.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDE3NTcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-10-17 16:54:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Harkreader is one of the best professors I've ever had! She is personable, clear with her expectations, and reasonable with her assignments. You will improve as a writer if you take her class. I wish she taught more so I could take another class from her. 10/10 would recommend!

She gives feedback quickly and posts grades fast, and if you email her she will always respond and answer your questions. You definitely have to work and sometimes it seems like a lot for a freshman class but the class is interesting and you will learn a lot.

In her class, you are allowed to chose what you would like to write about, something most teachers don't allow students to do. It made the class a lot more interesting.

She wants you to pass and cares that you learn what you should so you do a good job in the next one. She uses examples from the news and other realworld things, even memes she connects to the lesson.
