She is very stuck up and rude. She gets mad over some of the dumbest things ever (like not paper clipping your paper correctly). I already did not like English already, but she made it that much worse! I think she should really stop teaching. I would hate to see how she treats her kids at home.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MjA2OTM5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2008-12-14 20:05:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Useless Teacher.She is not emotionaly balanced.Totally waste of time.
