He comes off as monotone and absent-minded, but he actually has a very dry sense of humor which makes him hilarious. He is also willing to help you at all times, he replies to e-mails within an hour or two. He is a fair grader and gives good feedback","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NzI0NjMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2015-12-10 17:29:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a good professor.
