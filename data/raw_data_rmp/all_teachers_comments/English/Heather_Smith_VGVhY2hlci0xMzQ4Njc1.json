She holds conferences at the end of semester where she tells you your likely grade but ends up giving you something else. I do not like her grading style and regretted taking her class. She killed my GPA. Take her only if u are a good writer already","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTIzNjc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2010-11-07 14:59:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Heather Dahn (formerly Smith) is one of the best professors I've ever had the pleasure of having. Witty and incisive commentary in class with good discussions plus an honest and straightforward teaching style make her a blessing to the English Department.

She's definitely a tough teacher, and I do understand these mixed reviews. I enjoyed her class because I'm a relatively decent writer. Just listen to her lectures, prepare your work by the deadlines, turn in a rough draft of your papers to her, and learn how to use proper English.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjU1Mzc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2010-08-11 15:15:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take her!

The grading scale for the class is structured so that you can still get an A by completing in-class assignments.
