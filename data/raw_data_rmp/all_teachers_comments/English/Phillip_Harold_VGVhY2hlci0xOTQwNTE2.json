All he wants out of you is attendance in the class and you will do completely fine so I'd suggest you take him.

With covid, the class was online and he made all the weekly discussion questions fun. One week we had to take a Harry Potter quiz to see what house we were in and why it made since.

He post maybe about 2 hours of work to do outside of class if that. He understands that none of us are really there to because we are English majors so he makes it interesting and fun too.
