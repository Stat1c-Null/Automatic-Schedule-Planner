However, she is a tough grader but helps you get to where she expects your writing to be. There were no tests nor quizzes, just four essays and one was with a group. I strongly recommend her.

She is a fairly easy grader and she checks all drafts and guides you to ensure you have an A before it's actually submit it. Must show up to class she takes attendance every day.

A little picky on grading and a little confusing at first, but will go out of her way to clarify. Gives feedback + outlines on all papers, and is extremely helpful. Fan of group projectswork. Have to work for your A (mots people get B's), but very doable. No quizzestests. :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzk5MzM5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101ENGLISH","date_posted":"2014-11-12 17:42:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is really nice and chill, but a little confusing and a tough grader.

Very laid back, and I'm more than likely going to take her for 1102. She can be a tough grader, but she goes out of her way to help. You can text her at anytime, and she will always get back to you at some point. No tests or quizzes, just papers. Last project is a collaborative project. I'd recommend her to anybody.

She was the best professor to have going into college.  She was there for you and she helped out as much as needed.  She helped me revise my papers before turning them in so I could learn right and wrong in writing essays.  Max of 3 papers and one group project at the end.  Attendance isn't mandatory but is highly recommended.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzUzMTU1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2014-10-07 01:13:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet lady & laid back. Vague on what's expected for papers & seems to add random requirements as we work on them. Confusing at first. Just follow her draft feedback exactly & talk with her after class. Absolutely need the Writing Arguments book. Class needs more structure; almost too much writing freedom that can be confusing. Not horrible.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjM0NTAw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
