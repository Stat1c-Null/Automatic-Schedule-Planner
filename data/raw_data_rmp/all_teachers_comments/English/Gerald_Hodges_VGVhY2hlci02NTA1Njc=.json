Easy Class.  ...The class was really elementary (I had him for English Composition 2), but I don't think you can blame him.

You have to write a lot of essays but he lets u turn them in any time throughout the simester as long as you have them in the end. He's willing to meet with you out of class any time, just schedule it with him. 4 or 5 quizzes that were 10 or 12 questions but u only had to get 4 right to make a 100.
