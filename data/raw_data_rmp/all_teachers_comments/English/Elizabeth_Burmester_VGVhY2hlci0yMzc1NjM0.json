She gives great feedback and has clear expectations. Her papers are expected to be around 5 pages, and she gives extra credit! I wish I could take her for all of my english classes, no tests, and no final. I never made below an A on any assignment, i will miss her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDcyODM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2018-12-04 20:47:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"AMAZING. Do not buy the textbook, you will not need it. She is very passionate about what she teaches and is not boring at all. There are three essays throughout the semester but she lets you decide what you want to write it on based on your interests and future career paths. Gives AMAZING feedback. Use the feedback she gives and you will make an A","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODY2NzIy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2018-10-26 00:00:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is literally amazing. There are not enough reviews on this woman. When you write a rough draft, she will read the entire thing and fix everything for you to just refix and resubmit for the final draft. She really cares about you and your grade and lit.

I have never been one to like English or writing papers (which you do a lot of in this class) but she really helped me learn how to write good essays and she gives good feedback. If you ever get stuck on something send her an email and she always explains things in depth to you. She's sweet and caring too.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTY2NjI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--SO MANY PAPERS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2018-05-11 18:48:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Burmester is an expert in English, thus she is great at teaching it.
