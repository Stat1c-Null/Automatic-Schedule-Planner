Assignments are step by step, oriented around a chosen topic, and lead up to a research paper. You can also receive extra credit by visiting the writing center and having your paper looked over by people who excel in writing. This class is very peer review oriented as well.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjQ0NDgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2025-02-28 17:20:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Love her! Shes very understanding but still holds you accountable. Theres good workload that isnt overwhelming but also doesn't feel like I'm doing nothing in the class. No tests/quizzes, and there is a good amount of chances for a little extra credit. She reminds me of a cool older sister, makes learning and doing work in her class so much easier.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzIwNDAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2025-02-05 16:30:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor for an essay A, she cares, and wants you to pass.

Straight out the gate, she's very sociable, caring, understanding, and a great professor. All the assignments taken during the semester are understandable and if you do the work to your best effort, you should get an A in the class. 10/10 would recommend.
