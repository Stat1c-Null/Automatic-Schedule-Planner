She is super nice, funny, and laid-back. My class constantly trolled her and she loved it. She grades fairly and gives you chances to improve and get a higher grade. She also gets the class into interesting topic conversations. I loved having her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyOTA4MTM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2009-08-19 06:33:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome! She won't catch you on every grammar mistake, because she's more into your effort and creativity. She's a great prof. Really nice and helpful. Made the summer class fun. 4 essays no problems. SHE IS SUPER RAD. Take her if you enjoy writing or even if it isn't your strong suit. She will help you out no matter what.

I really enjoyed her class. She loves writing and is very passionate about finding your own writing style/voice. We used the book some, but not much. She does give you a large creative license, which is nice. I would definitely take her class again and would recommend her to anyone. She is very approachable as well.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MjI1ODMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2008-11-21 21:21:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"We all have to take this class, so it might as well be with someone who'll empower you to enjoy it.
