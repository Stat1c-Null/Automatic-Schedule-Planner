Easy class, but you really have to keep up on your own because it was a hybrid class 50% online.

He also provides extra credit opportunities that give you up to five points on assignments as well. Overall, probably the best English class I've taken.

Discussions and vlog posts weekly, very lenient of when some of them could be turned in. Gives extra credit if you take your paper to the writing center. Lectures were online and you expected to watch them before class. Not a terrible class to take, but there are easier English classes.

Teaching this way means there's no interaction, you can't ask for clarification during a lecture.  His office time was limited.  As this was a writing class, his opinion meant everything, meaning if he didn't like you, you were doomed.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3MDg2ODA0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-12-03 05:02:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"A professor with a great sense of humor. Very understanding when you reach out to him about assignments and whatnot. He does grade toughly, however. Lots of constant small and easy assignments, and 4 big assignments, including a group final project for the class (NO FINAL EXAM). I'd recommend this class to most of my friends.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTU0MzY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--EXTRA CREDIT--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-10-27 20:18:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall good, very kind, sense of humor, just do what he tells you to.

Very clear on what needs to be in papers and I never got below a 95. He's very fun and his class was always interesting. As long as you communicate with him he is willing to give extensions.

I would recommend to always show up to class because sometimes there were in class assignments due same day.
