I have to admit, this course was one that I will never forget for several reasons. Primarily, never had I teacher accept nothing less than excellence from his students. Indeed his standards were high, and for some classmates overwhelmingly so, however this class taught me how to write well.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDUzNTMy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2016-12-12 15:33:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class wasn't easy for me but I worked harder and he helped where he could.
