Allowed to mis 3 classes without it effecting your grade.. but you can't miss more than 6.. Avoid an early morning class if you can.. because the only bad thing about his class in my opinion is 1) He's a semi-hard grader 2) the morning classes are a Mind-f b'/c it's pointless. Overall.. decent and nice","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5Mjg2ODc5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2011-11-20 20:49:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a nice guy and I believe he means well. But sometimes he is unclear and wants a lot of disscussion. However, alot of the things he wants you to read are pointless and hard to disscuss. He makes you write alot of little papers that boost your grade so its not bad.

He grades as if you are an english major and i once i get my essay back i can barely see my paper through all the red marks.

Afterwards, I found myself dreading writing a paper or reading a story. He is very smart! Almost to smart to be teaching. He doesn't explain in enough detail what he expects out of your papers, but when he returns them there is more red on the paper than what you had written.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjI4MDI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
