Assignments are pretty easy and she gives you time to complete in class, but spends most of her time talking about pointless stuff with other student. Easy class, but useless professor.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDg0MTQ0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
