You write some papers in this class and discuss Sharon Astycks book, which is madness of itself. I liked this class, personally. If you write your first drafts and actually fix the errors, you will get a good grade.

We wrote a lot of papers. Most buy the books. If you had a bad paper you could ask her to turn it in on a later date for not points off. I would recommend if you are not going to be a writing major.
