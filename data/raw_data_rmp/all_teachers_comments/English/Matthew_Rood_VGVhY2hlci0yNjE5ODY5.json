That's why I got him for my 1102. Although I got a C+, I also really didn't do a lot of the assignments. assignments that were easy, fun, and interesting. Shame on me. The grade I got is on me, but for you easy A+. Highly Recommend taking the class especially if you're a freshman.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzA4Mjgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-01-05 04:07:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was quite literally one of the best professors Ive ever had.

I'll keep it short and sweet. If you have the chance to take him, do so. He gives very clear feedback, is very engaging, informative, and most of all, entertaining. He makes the work fun, not a chore.
