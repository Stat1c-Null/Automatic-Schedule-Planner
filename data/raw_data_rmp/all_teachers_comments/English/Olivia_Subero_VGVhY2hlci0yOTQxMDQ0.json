Class is pretty pointless as she just reads off the textbook. Assignments are relatively easy and if you put in the work and follow the rubric you will get an A. Her &#8220;Owl-Allowance&#8221; system is very misleading and confusing, so get with her early to clarify it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjU3MDIy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2025-05-08 20:28:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her grading policy is not fair.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjE2MDQ3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2025-01-06 16:27:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great professor and actually connects with her students through 1 on 1 conferences. The essay rubric and grading is pretty strict, but if you follow instructions you can get perfect scores on all the rough draft (huge part of grade).

She offers essay rewrites but often doesn't reply to questions or accept them. Extra credit is assigned but not graded or included in final grades. Do not take her class.
