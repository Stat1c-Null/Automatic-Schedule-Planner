Because I wasn't as interested in his personal life that he likes to share and the class was interested I was basically outcasted. I feel like he wasn't very fair. All I cared about was my grade at the end of the day.

He clearly cares about his students and provides phenomenal feedback for every assignment for each person. The class layout is simple, but effectively teaches you what you need to know.
