By far one of the easiest and most fun classes. Dr. Aughey is very caring, funny, and will reply to emails immediately with extensions to papers/tests. Her class is graded by a total of 1000 points, so just do all of her main assignments and it's an easy A.

She's amazing, caring, and funny. The only professor I've had that took into account the times we're in. Assignments are fun because you're given creative freedom.
