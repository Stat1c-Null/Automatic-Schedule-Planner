Knows what she wants from your papers but doesn't clearly tell you.  If you pick a topic she isn't interested in say goodbye to your grade.

A professor's job is to help students and answer any questions they may have. Schofer never seems to give direct answers and, in that way, she is not very helpful. She instead attacks whatever work you may have done without advice on how to improve. My advice is to steer clear of Maria Schofer.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjM4NDM4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
