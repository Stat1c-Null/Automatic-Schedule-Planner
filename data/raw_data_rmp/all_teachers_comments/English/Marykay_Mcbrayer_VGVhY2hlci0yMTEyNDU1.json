With that said, listen to me and me alone and you will be well advised. Mary Kay is a really cool person, but I can see why her teaching methods are controversial. Do the work and there will be plenty of cushion. Don't, and yafail!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njg2MTAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2017-11-06 18:53:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love MaryKay but she definitely makes you work for your grade. Shes super sweet and nice I took her 2 semesters ago and we still keep in touch. With that being said I got a B in her class based off the work I did, she doesnt grade based on whether or not she likes you, she grades fairly.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODQ0Mzg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2017-05-04 01:00:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would never take this class, again. E V E R ! Grading rubric is harsh. She'll  belittle you as if your the one asking stupid questions. She's sweet when she wants to be, but if it comes down to your way or hers, believe me, you will be ruled out! She has a my way or highway attitude, run. Someone needs to put her back in her place.

Really cares about the students and their thoughts on her teaching styles. She really tries to adapt to whatever the students feel is this most effective. She cares about your grade, and makes sure that you have plenty of time to work on papers. Doesn't grade too hard and you only have 3 papers. Not much work. I recommend her!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2Mzc1MzIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2016-04-05 17:55:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very nice and always willing to help you out. There is a ton of reading and a few essays. There is homework (writing) due every class. Participation is a must for her class so if you are on the shy side, like myself, you'll basically be forced to talk. Overall, the class was ok.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjM2MTQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2016-03-04 19:36:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor McBrayer is an awesome English Professor! She is so bubbly and knowledgeable about what she teaches, and easily relates to her students. She is always there if you need help on a paper or feedback as well.
