I once got special permission for something and then she counted me off for it. When I reminded her, she remembered then said she wouldn't change my grade. Basically you have the papers you write and then you have a few random in class assignments, nothing special.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDUyNjQw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2017-12-29 03:00:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"She isn't the most organized, as others have said, though her grading is easy. There were three major paper assignments and various reading responses. As long as you follow the guidelines and have some sort of logic behind writing your paper, you'll get around a 90 on each paper. Reading assignments are easy. Never touched the books once, so..","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MzU0NjI2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--SO MANY PAPERS--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2017-12-08 19:37:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely unorganized. 3 papers and reading responses usually pertaining to the papers.

I do not suggest getting the books because we have not used it once. There are three essays and lots of reading responses that are super pointless.

She is kind of forgetful, so she forgets to post the discussion posts; however, she will never hold it against the student. Her hybrid class isn't really hybrid, most of the work is done in class. Her notes are easy to follow and she is not that tough of a grader.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODUyOTMw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
