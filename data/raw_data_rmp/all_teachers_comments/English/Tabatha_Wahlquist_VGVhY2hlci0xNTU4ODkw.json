Her feedback on your papers will praise you for how well your essay is written but she still will give you a B or C because of small (and i mean small) errors, such as the improper position of a period on a reference page. And she will find every little error she can to ensure you dont get a A","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDczOTMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2011-12-01 13:04:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Enjoyed her alot!! She worked with me when I was having personal issues and gave me great advice. I liked her humorous approach to things and I looked forward to her class. Her coursework was pretty simple, everything kinda ran in a set schedule.  Simple assignments and enough time to work on the papers. But she grades HARSH.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzUxMTI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2011-04-07 01:46:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really liked this prof! If you would consider yourself to be a legitimately good writer, then def take her! Three 3-5 page papers & a 5-7 page paper. You'll do a few group assignments on occasion, but no big deal. Def. get the text book & bring to class, she expects you to read beforehand but it's not bad at all. Very funny, nice & laid back.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzcwNTc3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
