He's not really concerned so much with content or the effectiveness of your argument, but rather grammar. Hopefully if you're in college, this shouldn't be a problem. All about conspiracy theories, sort of thinks he's a psychologist. Class is brutal. Group projects are unnecessary and annoying. Easy A.

Why limit us to a confined theme? On top of that, we couldn't change our topic at all, he was very unhelpful in giving advice, and then he failed my final paper which shouldn't have made sense.
