I worked really hard on my paper and had him look over it plus I took it to the writing center and he gave me a C. I used to love writing and always did well until I took his class. He took all the fun out of it.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTAxMTQ4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2008-03-26 19:37:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved Dr. Saunders!  He is really nice and you can tell he actually cares about his students.  His class is not super easy, but it is possible to make an A.  He will review your paper before the due date and give helpful pointers.  I made a high A on every paper and I am definitely not a writer.  Just put in a little effort and you'll be fine!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MjA1MDA5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2007-01-09 19:48:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"fairly easy class with a very nice, interesting teacher. his expectations are not unrealistic, yet you do have to push yourself some. I wish this prof had been more clear about what he wanted- like given examples. However, he always offers help- I was just too shy to ask for it. A good 1101 course.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNzUwMzUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
