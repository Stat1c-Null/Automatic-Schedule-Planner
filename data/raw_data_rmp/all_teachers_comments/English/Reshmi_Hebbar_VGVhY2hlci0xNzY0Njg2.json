She is not an easy grader, but she is far. She gives you a clear explanation to why you received the grade. She helped me with my writing skills and was overall a great teacher. The book is essential in this class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzI3MDQ5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"COMP1102","date_posted":"2013-04-27 01:02:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hebbar is a very smart woman. She tries her best to explain the material to the students. One criticism is her grading, but she is preparing students for upper-level grading scales. I appreciate the class she taught, and would take another class if she were to teach one that was available to me.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjE2Mzcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2013-04-08 13:08:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Extremely difficult. She is a great teacher, and you will definitely learn a lot and improve your writing skills. HARSH grader though. Almost impossible to get an A- barely skimmed by with a B. she is smart, knows what she's talking about, and has interesting classes. Not a fair class though, I would say. I didn't like her enough to take her again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTAwNzcw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGLI1101","date_posted":"2012-12-12 01:42:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not an easy A or B but you will come out a better writer. I don't advise the Friday morning classes as they are too long. She is very smart and knows what she is talking about. She is also very sweet!

She knows how to present her ideas and she looks for interaction in her class. She will help tremendously on your writing, however she grades mercilessly. Really engaging class though, I don't mind it, other than the 2.5 hours i spend in it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE4NTEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGSH1101","date_posted":"2012-11-10 19:22:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Hebbar is a very wonderful teacher, but she is also very smart which sometimes prevents her from being clear with assignments. You have to write 4 papers during the semester, and we had 2 reading quizzes. You have to read every night but it isn't a lot. Overall, I recommend her as an English teacher, and her class was moderately easy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODExNTI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
