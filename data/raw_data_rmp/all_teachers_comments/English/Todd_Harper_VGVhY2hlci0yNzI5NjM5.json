He was able to explain complex topics (ancient rhetoric) and facilitate heated discussions very well. Reading was difficult due to the nature of it, but he made good connections","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjkyOTI2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2023-03-12 00:08:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took 1102, but Dr. Harper was amazing.

He loves a class that talks back, overall easy going guy! He does take attendance, so showing up is most definitely key.
