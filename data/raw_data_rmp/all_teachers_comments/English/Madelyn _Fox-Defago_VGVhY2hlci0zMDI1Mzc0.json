It wouldn't let me select but I took her for 1102. She's very willing to help with zero judgment. Minor assignments are extra credit but you only get the credit by attending class. No phone policy so at times when the class is lecture heavy it's a bit disengaging, so participate in discussions.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODc5MTc3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2025-01-06 16:05:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is great take this class. She makes it really easy to do all the assignments the d2l assignments and chill. It's a lot of prep work for each class but if you stay on top of it it's chill. If you don't do any of the minors they don't count off the just add to your grade. 3 big essays and that's it.

All of the homework she offers is extra credit and gave me an extra letter grade in the class, and its all pretty easy too. She doesn't assign tests, just three papers and a final &#8220;portfolio&#8221; of what you learned in the semester. She also very clearly outlines what you need.
