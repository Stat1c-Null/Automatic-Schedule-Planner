A worksheet, discussion post, and short essay once a week and a research paper/project throughout the semester but it is very straightforward. She doesn't bury things in the syllabus and act arrogant like other professors would.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2OTM5NTQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1102","date_posted":"2022-10-17 18:34:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is super chill and gives every paper a A as long as you do it.
