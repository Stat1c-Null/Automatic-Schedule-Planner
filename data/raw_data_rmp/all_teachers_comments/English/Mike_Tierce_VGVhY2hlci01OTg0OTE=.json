I wish I could take him all the time. He is strict, MUST attend, but he is NOT boring in any way. His required writings & book readings need to be done before every class, 3 hrs once a week is great.

He'll take off points if you're not there. But he offers extra credit, too. If you take notes on the movie and print the ones he gives you online, the tests are a PIECE OF CAKE.

Cares more about dotting i's and crossing t's than actual content of papers.  Made an A in class but never once was recognized for a good paper.  Control freak in class.  Hardly any discussion.

You learn a lot about observing the intentional decisions made in film-making to convey subliminal messages.
