As long as you put in effort you'll get a good grade. Makes assignments fun and encourages you to write about pop culture and topics you are actually interested in. She'll often release class early. Usually 3 papers (test grades) per semester and weekly assignments.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDA3ODkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2025-03-26 17:56:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is one of the most understanding teachers I've ever had. She understands that life happens, which is sometimes unheard of with professors. She grades based on 100, 50, or 0, so it's literally either you did the assignment, or you didn't. She also provides great feedback for the assignments if you ask her, which is great!
