The class was focused entirely around Jane Austen which wasn't made clear until the first day. Lectures all class period, every class period about whatever novel you're reading. Sparknotes helped.

This class was very dry, and at times it was a chore to get through. Great woman, genuinely nice human being, but may love her book selections too much to put any actual personality into her lectures. I'm not a Jane Austen fan, and that hasn't changed.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNzE4ODQ0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3322","date_posted":"2013-12-14 11:01:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Oh, I can't say enough good things about Dr. Dabundo and this class!
