She is VERY opinionated and if you don't agree with her, you're wrong. She is way too nit picky on grammar and very unclear on due dates.

Will lend help if you need it.  Took Honors section, and had to read 1 novel, and write a few papers (including a lengthy research project) which actually was pretty enjoyable.
