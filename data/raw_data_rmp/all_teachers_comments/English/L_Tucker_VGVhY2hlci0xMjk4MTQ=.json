She talks about everything but the material she actually tests you on, gives nothing solid for study ... seems to be just biding her time until retirement--could have been a great class, but was a total waste of time (I did make an A, so no sour grapes--it just sucked).","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExOTU0NDI1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2270","date_posted":"2006-05-09 22:40:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed taking her class.

You do homework on new material and then she explains the subject. Also not very flexible when it comes to grades but maybe you can't be with grammar.
