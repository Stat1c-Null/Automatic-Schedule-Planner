She is dedicated, warm, and has a great sense of humor. She loves to have sessions with students to progress their writing process. Highly recommend her, but don't think she will be teaching 1102 next semester (Spring 08).","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNjk0Njc5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
