He likes to give pop quizzes with only three questions, so make sure you know the reading, and if you are not in class to take the pop quiz, it is an automatic zero if you go to class and write the papers, well it's an easy A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MDMyMDg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

He is a very reasonable grader, gives bonus opportunities, and keeps class interesting. Despite a difficult, Coronavirus-filled semester, this class was the one class I enjoyed among many others.

He is a grad student so he understands how boring the course is, he makes the class fun. He is so funny and respectable and very honest which intimidates some people, but he is genuinely so nice.

He wants you to pass so do the work and you definitely will!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNjM0MDU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2020-06-30 01:09:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super cool and funny. Made youtube videos when covid happened that were very entertaining. He is very down to earth. Can be intimidating at first, but he's pretty cool if u need help. Anytime he assigns a reading, read it because there's usually a quiz on it the next day.

Criteria is basic and he lets you know up front what too expect. He is also a student teacher so he will work with you as long as you work with him.
