She doesn't like just lecturing and wants to bring everyone into the conversation.

Ms. Joni is okay as a person but as a teacher SHE IS TOUGH! I like english but I hated taking her class. She takes herself way too seriously. She has this dry humor and it feels like the class drags on! She assigns SOOO many assignments and makes it harder than what it should be. Take someone else.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDkwMjA5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
