She also grades things harshly and grades you on things that do not pertain to the class. There are lots of reading exercises and group work over that reading. There are pop quizzes / written assignments over the reading homework. The work in the class itself, is not really that difficult.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjEyNjk0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

We were her &quot;guinea pigs&quot; to how she would teach the next class. It was a lot of reading and lectures which made linguistics difficult to fully grasp. She did want our feedback on everything midway and at the end. She didn't grade tough and gave lots of feedback.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyODgwOTky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LING3025","date_posted":"2020-01-16 15:57:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Take her!!!!! Ive never been excited to attend an 8am class, I wish I could take this course everyday instead 2 days out of the week. Her methods of teaching linguistic is brilliant.
