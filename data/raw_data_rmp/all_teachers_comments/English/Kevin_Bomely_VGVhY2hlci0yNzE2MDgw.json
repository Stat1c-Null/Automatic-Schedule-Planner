His class was super comprehensive and we went through each factor of each paper before we wrote them. Only had a few papers all in all, they aren't long or super difficult. He provides a TON of extra credit, and responds quickly to emails and such. If you put in a little bit of effort then you'll likely make an easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1ODU5MjY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2022-02-01 00:44:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Could not have hoped for a better first semester taking English 1101 with Professor Bomely. Go to class and take his advice and all will go well. When you have an essay, make what you write about something you truly care for. It will improve your writing and probably help your grade.

His papers have clear-cut criteria almost that you can just look at it and know how to write your papers. He provides extra credit a lot like meetings with the writing center and after every paper. he will also meet with you one on one if you ask to discuss what to do if you want to get your grade up.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MTYyNDgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
