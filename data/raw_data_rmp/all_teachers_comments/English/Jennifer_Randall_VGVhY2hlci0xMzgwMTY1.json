Just great. If you are unsure on what professor to take for English 1101, look no further. Plenty of time for the assignments, revisions are allowed, extremely nice and helpful. I sincerely enjoyed this class and the assignments.

Super nice and extremely helpful. She lets you fix essays/assignments for a chance at a better grade if you turn them in on time. Class was interesting and fun.
