She makes you work for your grade but is there every step of the way. She is very quick to respond on emails and is always willing to help you! I would highly suggest you take her, especially if your major involves some form of writing. She taught me how to make a paper better.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDY2MDM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL131","date_posted":"2018-05-06 14:31:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Mitchell is a very good Professor. I felt like I learned more about writing in her class than I ever had over the past 12 years of school and first semester of freshman year. Her favorite words are How? and Why? She heavily emphasizes critical thinking and is willing to help you better your paper in any way possible.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDAxNjU0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--SO MANY PAPERS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2017-11-26 21:16:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall, she's pretty cool. As long as you actually put forth the effort, go to class, and listen, you'll pass. Don't have your phone out, and be sure to go to class. I'd say she is a great professor.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTYzOTgx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
