She is very tough on grading and expects an in-depth knowledge of the films we watch. The film's themselves aren't bad in any way, but the assignments that relate to the films are just awful to complete. All in all, this is just a tedious class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTc3OTc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"FILM3220","date_posted":"2024-11-21 21:46:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Get ready to watch boring, obscure movies and write about them.
