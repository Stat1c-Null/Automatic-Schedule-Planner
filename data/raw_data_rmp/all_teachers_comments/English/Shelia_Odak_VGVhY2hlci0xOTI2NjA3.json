Class was based on one essay that we worked on all semester. No tests or quizzes. Just class work that you use to put together your essay. Not challenging at all.

She tells you what she wants in each paper (and puts it online). As long as you include the things she asks for in each paper, you should be fine. She gives good feedback and is really willing to help you if you need it. I got an 87 in 1101 because i didn't follow the guidelines of one paper. Most likely getting an A in 1102.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NjUzNTg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2110","date_posted":"2015-04-19 19:48:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class is great.

She is a very nice woman and extremely helpful BUT her expectations are still not clear. For our papers, there were instructions but no rubric so we had a faint idea of what were we were actually being graded on. And if you don't like peer editing, stay away! Peer editing was about 60% of the class and a waste of time.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTQwMDk0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"2110","date_posted":"2015-04-01 10:11:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a good teacher who gets straight to the point. Her assignments are simple just read what she tells you to outside of class. She has regular reading quizzes, but doesnt tell you when they are, but you can usually tell. There are three tests but once again they are easy. She doesnt try to trick you or surprise you just read and go to class.

It's one of those classes that will stress you out especially if you have other classes andor a job. You must really know the text and multiple literary terms. She gives a quiz almost every week I'm on financial aid so I didn't have the book for the first 2 quizzes she gave out. Tests are long and written.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Mzc2NTg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2015-01-09 19:42:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Odak is really laid back and is easy to talk to if you need help regarding an assignment. There were 4 papers and none of them exceeded 5 pages, however; you stick with the same topic for each paper. The class is really easy if you follow her criteria for the papers.

I absolutely hate the subject of english as I always have, but she made this the funnest english class I have ever taken.
