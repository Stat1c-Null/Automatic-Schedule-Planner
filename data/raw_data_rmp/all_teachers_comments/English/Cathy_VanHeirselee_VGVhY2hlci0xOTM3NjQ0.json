I have been awarded many times bc of my writing skills and I wrote great papers for her that i would put so much work and effort into and she was still the hardest most ridiculous grader. She would come up with things to take off points for. She wouldn't remind you in class about assignments or even mention them.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NjE1NjE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

She gives great feedback and she is there for you. She respects all of her students and the work is pretty easy for the most part. 4 essays and daily assignments which will help your grade in the end.

She is very helpful and will provide constructive feedback. You can talk to her anytime about any problems you have with assignments. If you show up to class and do all the little assignments, you will be fine. She is a tough grader, but in a good way.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTI2Njc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2015-12-09 21:56:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a really nice lady. I am pretty good at writing, I never made less than an A in highschool. I made one B and 2 As on papers and straight As on easy homework reflections. She has everything laid out in pdf files for homework assignments. Prepare to spend about 2 hours per week on busy work.

She gives multiple assignments a week along with frequent essays. She is a cool teacher who's funny but her explanations of assignments and essays suck. So confusing and unclear.

There's 4 papers and all of them ranged from 3-4 pages, so it wasn't tough, but her grading was. I made a B on 3 of my papers and a C on the last.

Not very bad when it comes to work, but there definitely will be enough assignments. The only knock to her class is that when it comes to writing papers, she can tend to put too much time into what goes into the essay and not necessarily what the essay should include, like a guideline. It's rough.

About 4 papers throughout the semester, and after she grades them she gives them back to you with feedback so you can correct it for  a better grade. Also a few daily grades.
