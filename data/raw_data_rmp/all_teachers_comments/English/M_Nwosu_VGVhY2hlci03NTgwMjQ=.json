He is from Nigeria and consequently he does have an accent but its not too hard to understand him. He is easy to talk to and listens to student opinions. Very Good Natured.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExOTYwNTUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG2110","date_posted":"2006-05-19 19:28:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gives multiple novels to read some boring and some interesting, in all there were like nine. only like two of them we did not have to read the whole book. Rarely have test, but when did the test consist of lines from the book and we had to tell who said it, to who, and the context of it. Hard to understand.
