And it was but she also gave my so many pointers that helped even in my 1102 class. Always go to the writing lab before. I made a 99, 97, and 96 on the first three papers. Which made me very confident in my writing ability.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDkxODM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2014-04-30 14:47:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is literally the most amazing instructor that I have ever had in my entire schooling career. Class is only mandatory cause of the English Department's policy, so go to class. Get the textbooks, they're actually interesting to read and you will use them a lot. She is super easy-going, and fun to learn from. You'll miss out if you don't take her!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTMxOTU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2014-03-27 13:40:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's chill and nice.

She is really cool. No tests, just essays. You never have to read either, she assigns DOES readings... but you only talk about them and you can just sit and listen. Attendance is mandatory, unfortunately, but that's okay .. She is fun to listen to cause she can be rather humorous.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNjI1MTc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2013-11-05 11:50:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ms. Reidy is a grad student, she is really young, but that is what makes her great.
