It is a lot less writing than the other 1101 classes and you will appreciate that. She is always happy and understanding. A lot of class discussion. 4 big essays, not too hard though.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzAwOTEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2009-10-23 17:42:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Going into college I was nervous about having an English class. I am so glad I took Professor Keith's class. She grades fairly and moves deadlines all the time. She understands that things happen and times change. She is very open minded and free spiritied. I definitely reccommend her! I'm taking her again next semester for 1102!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MjY3Mjk2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
