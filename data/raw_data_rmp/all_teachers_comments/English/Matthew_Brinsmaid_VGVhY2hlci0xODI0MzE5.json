There are no tests. There are three papers the first one was on how to build a fire I wrote it the day of and made an 85 and I am not a good writer. The last two papers are on into the wild and the second one is just a revision of the first one.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzOTA2ODc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2014-11-07 12:36:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Brinsmaid is easily my favorite English teacher I've ever had.
