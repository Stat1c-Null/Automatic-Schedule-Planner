This class was so unlike any other classes I've taken that I loved it. There wasn't a set curriculum, as it was more discussion based. She really works hard to make the class a democratic environment and listens to her students concerns on deadlines and assignments. Would 100% take her again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzkyOTkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"WRIT3140","date_posted":"2017-12-11 08:42:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Bohannon is such an amazing professor. Take her if you can! She teaches so well, the classes are great, they are like a real work community. She gives clear instructions and grading. Dr. Bohannon also lets you revise work if you need it to show that you can do better on the assignment. She truly wants her students to succeed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTI2ODQw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures--Would take again","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3030","date_posted":"2017-11-30 17:18:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. B is hilarious and amazing. She really goes the extra mile for her students and ensures that everyone does well. She doesn't like failing people and is always willing to work with you on getting a better grade. There are some writing assignments that are a little word heavy but nothing too hard. DEFINITELY her if you can.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDA0MzU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL3030","date_posted":"2017-04-29 19:41:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Bohannon really believes in a democratic classroom and works hard to listen to her students and take ideas on how to shape assignments that work for everyone.

Make sure you show up to class because she only goes over assignment guides once (unless you come in later with specific questions). She made the class easy to relate to and used interesting mediums (video, prezi, blogs) instead of just writing boring papers.
