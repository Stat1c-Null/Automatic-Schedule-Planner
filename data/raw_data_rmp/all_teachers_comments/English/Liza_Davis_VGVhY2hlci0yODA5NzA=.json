She is not a tough grader but the class is a lot of work. Will definitely make you a better writer with the most thorough comments I have ever seen, and opportunities to revise papers using them.

One of the nicest professors I've ever had and she's very knowledgeable.  Class was discussion based and everyone had a chance to participate.  Not too tough of a grader.
