He is my favorite professor I have had thus far. Graded mostly on three essays... there's some other stuff but more than half your grade depends on these three. You have to show up but that's never really an issue because I enjoy his class. I recommend his 1 day a week class because, although it's listed as a hybrid, it's really not.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjY2NDg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2021-11-12 19:45:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"My first impression of him was that he'd make a good cult leader. He takes participation pretty seriously, so get ready to speak up in class. Aside from the three papers that make up 70% of your grade in total, it's easy to get a 100 on every assignment. He's approachable and clear with exactly what he wants you to write. Pretty interesting class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjMyMjYx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--So many papers","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
