The lectures are way to long and super boring. The assignments are pretty easy and its easy to pass the class she just makes the class uncomfortable. She calls on random people when no one raises their hands and often picks on kids who are quieter and don't often raise their hands.

Her work instructions are confusing and she doesn't give specifics within the 3 big assignments. Me and a few others have stated that her passive aggressiveness downplays our confidence in our ability to complete our work. I understand that she is here to help, but her way is very unhealthy.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzA2MDcy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2025-02-20 23:03:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"Even in a small class it seem very hard to connect with her.

Content-wise its pretty average but can get very repetitive over time, its mostly powerpoints and useless readings. Her rubrics and guidelines for essays are not the most clear, and don't bother asking about it either because she'll be very passive agressive and talk down to you if you ask.

If she does not like you personally she will grade you towards that. Not only are her instructions unclear and confusing, and she treats her students like they are dumb, or slow if they ask clarification questions.

She wastes lots of time just to fill in the lecture time, and she gives way too many readings. She also says you NEED to do the readings when in reality they are useless 90% of the time.

She spends class time making weird examples out of the 5 students in her class and overall just being demeaning and nasty.
