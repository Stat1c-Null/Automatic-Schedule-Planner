I enjoyed her assignments as they gave me a chance to write about things I was genuinely interested in. Not many people attended her lectures (not sure why, she was very fun) but those who did understand how good of a time her class was. My favorite class in my freshman year.

Apparently, English teachers have their own \"area of writing\" and hers was movies. Sure she wasn't good about answering emails, but everything was very clear. She had a week of grace in the final week of class, and also a multimodal project that if good enough to her, you could exempt the final.
