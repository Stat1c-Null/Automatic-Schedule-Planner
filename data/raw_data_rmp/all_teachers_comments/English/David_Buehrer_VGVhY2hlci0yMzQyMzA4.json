Each quiz is 15 points with 3 written responses, so missing one point on a response is an automatic 93% on it. He grades pretty harshly but gives actually really good feedback and clearly explains what you missed. Only two exams, which are actually pretty easy. His class is boring though, he just lectures for 90 minutes","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzkzMDU5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2021-12-03 03:50:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"I did a hybrid class, so our work was online, but we met for lectures once a week on Thursdays. There are no essays, however there is reading material every week, some longer than others. 11 quizzes and discussions, a midterm and a final exam all online. If you do the reading you will be fine. Also, the reading material textbook is required.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzU2MjYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL211O","date_posted":"2021-09-25 16:10:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"The professor is very funny and nice but is a very tough grader.

You can tell he is enthusiastic about teaching and always tries to make the lectures enjoyable. I HIGHLY recommend going to class as he covers everything you need to know for discussions/quizzes there. No essays. Tests are open book, just dont forget to cite quotes and youll be fine!

He is a great professor. He clearly teaches exactly what you need to know and he gives study guides for the tests.

For the most part, he let us pick our topics.
