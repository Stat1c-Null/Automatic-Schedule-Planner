You have to read every assignment and there are a good bit of them.  I am a biology major, so I really did not enjoy the content of this class.  He also grades the one paper harshly.  I felt I did very well, along with people in the writing center, yet I got an 80...

BUT YOU HAVE TO READ THE ASSIGNED STUFF. He will give you quizzes but he tells you when they are. Usually 5 questions you do a short answer. And you have to come to class. He gives you exactly what you need to know for midterm and final. Grades: Midterm, Final, quiz grades, 500 word paper, and participation.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDg0NTgz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG2110","date_posted":"2013-01-09 11:12:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed him. He is funny and the class may be a bore sometimes but it was easy. He did your final grade based on 4 things. The midterm and final he told you EXACTLY what to expect. The 1 paper you were supposed to write is tricky but he grades fair. And you only take like 5 quizzes that are straight from the stories. Easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjM0NzA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2012-10-23 09:03:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"this guy is so freaking hilarious, reminds me of Boss Hog from the Dukes of Hazard. you get 5 missed classes and as long as you only miss 5 he drops the lowest 2 quiz grades. quizzes are straight from the text and test are straight from the lecture...fun and easy class for sure.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzI2OTA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG2110","date_posted":"2011-12-05 18:48:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"flips out if you come in 30 sec late or if you ask a question. quizes are easy if you read the material but midterm,final and paper are opinion based and he is SUPER critical and flat RUDE with his comments on your work.

It was never just a random conversation; there was always a point to it. He can be a bit snappy but I found that to be endearing. Just read the given assignments and listen to his lectures and you'll do fine.

The class was interesting and he had you read important pieces of literature.

He is rude, overly opinionated, and stressful to be around. He is an idiot when it comes to technology. He just wrote a book, so prepare yourself to learn a lot about that. Actually- prepare to hear more about what he cares about than anything of importance.

He will ramble on a/b business (not english!) for the entire class making you want to shove pencils in your ears..
