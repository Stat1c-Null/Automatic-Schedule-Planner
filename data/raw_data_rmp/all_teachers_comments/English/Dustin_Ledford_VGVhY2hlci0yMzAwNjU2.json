His lectures were fun and not boring, and he keeps your attention well. I feel like I really learned a lot during his class as well.

Research based class, the papers aren't difficult. He gives excellent feedback on your papers, and will help you with anything! 4 major papers, online discussions, in class peer reviews, and the final is a presentation on you research topic.

I took him for both 1101 and 1102 because he was great. His lectures can get kinda boring but bearable. He grades fairly &amp; lays out everything you need to do in the rubric. The final is a presentation that you do with a group. Cares about his student.

He does not give extra homework and the &quot;assigned readings&quot; are all needed for the discussion post so you aren't doing any extra work.
