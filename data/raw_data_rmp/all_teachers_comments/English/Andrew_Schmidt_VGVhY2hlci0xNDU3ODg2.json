He came late almost everyday, so we pretty much didn't have to stay in class that long. We turned in everything at the end, which made people who slacked off able to turn their stuff in. Pretty chill person. Awesome shades and suits every week we say him. I took this class in Fall 2012. Take his class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxODc2MDE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1107","date_posted":"2011-12-14 16:08:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty fair, let's you turn in some late work.
