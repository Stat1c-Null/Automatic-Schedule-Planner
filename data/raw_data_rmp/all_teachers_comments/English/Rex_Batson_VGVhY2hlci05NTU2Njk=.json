So pay attention to punctuation etc. ALL & ALL, the SIMPLER & more CLEARER you write your essays the better grade you'll get. Attend classes ON-TIME, write your journals for at least a MONTH (he WON'T COLLECT IT AFTER that) & you'll get a sure A or B!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4OTIzNjA0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOM1101","date_posted":"2010-12-18 11:19:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"seriously, just get him to like you and you will get an A. I made B's and C's on all the projects, but at the end of the semester got an A. The projects were pretty difficult because he will not tell you what he's looking for talk to him about whatever he's interested in. If you're a girl, he's pretty dang creepy.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTg4MTYw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"TCOMM2010","date_posted":"2009-04-29 08:51:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"His teaching methods are unique but not all that effective.  If you take him make sure he likes you because you'll get in an A in the class.  Grading is detailed but mostly fair.

He was always willing to help read my papers before I turned them in and gave excellent feedback.  He accepted every paper up until the last day of class with no penalty.

Very nice and makes the class entertaining with his energy. However, he gives alot of assignments. Usually puts you on the spot in the class which gets you emabarrased.
