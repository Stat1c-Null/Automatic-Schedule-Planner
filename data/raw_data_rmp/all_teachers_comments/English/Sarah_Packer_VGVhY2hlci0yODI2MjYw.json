She has told us repeatedly her patience is thin and that if we don't satisfy her participation meter then she's going to make it mandatory. The class just feels like I'm acting because she's forcing it out of everyone. If you want a laid back professor, I would choose someone else.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjUxNDQ3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL-1101","date_posted":"2025-09-02 19:54:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Packer is a good professor that is passionate about teaching and her class. She'll tell you exactly what you need to do to pass the class. Participation does matter and she's particular about several aspects in her class. She makes sure her class is 0 cost to you.
