We wrote 4 papers which wasn't bad at all. She grades fairly and I only had one paper that wasn't an A... it was good but not on subject enough. So make sure you understand what she wants to read.

She didn't even read your essays all the way through, and then gave you a C because she completely missed the idea of the paper. Even after I asked her to read it again she said that she wasn't changing my grade, but she couldnt' tell me what my three paragraphs were about.
