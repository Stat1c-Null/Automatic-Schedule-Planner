Her weekly videos were the most helpful resource, offering step-by-step instructions and motivational words that helped me complete assignments with clarity and confidence.

That's my only complaint. But the reading was interesting because all of it surrounded true crime or podcasts.

I took 1101 last semester and had such a great experience that I took her for 1102. While she is tough, she is fair and supportive.
