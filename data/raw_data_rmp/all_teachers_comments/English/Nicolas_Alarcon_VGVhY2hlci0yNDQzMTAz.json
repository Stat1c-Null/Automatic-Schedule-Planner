Gives you group assignments every week with 3 major grades that are difficult and make no sense. When it comes to asking questions, he doesnt answer them at all and he is a harsh grader. Doesnt answer your emails, and the most pointless class. Get another professor if you can!!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDU3OTAy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2020-12-08 02:41:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"ENGL1101. Hands-off online class. Chill guy, lax grader. Three major assignments, 60%, weekly participation assignments, 40%. No final. The weekly assignments were done in groups of three or four- hopefully, y'all like your assigned groups. Generally a fun class though.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzOTc5MzM1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

At first There were no problems up until everything class related was on facebook, he didnt use D2L at all which was annoying and on top of that, all of our work was group work for the whole semester which is hard when your team wasn't doing their part.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzk2OTE4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL1102","date_posted":"2020-05-04 15:33:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is one of those professors that wants you to learn rather than give out grades. One major paper and two group assignments and then weekly assignments. Nice guy don't stress it just participate in class.

Nxt proj. is writing 5 minute sets (stand up comedy) and then the final part you combine several &amp; make it into one. The final project is a video of a sketch about student life, that U do in a group of 3.

His classes are different from your average English classes, and that makes his teaching style unique. You have two textbooks that revolve around rhetoric, humor, comedy, and more. There are four major assignments and no final or exams. He grades fair and wants us to succeed.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNjUzMjA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2019-12-07 18:27:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Alarcon is a great professor, he gives great lectures and really wants you to do well, attendance is mandatory and there are 3 projects and no final.
