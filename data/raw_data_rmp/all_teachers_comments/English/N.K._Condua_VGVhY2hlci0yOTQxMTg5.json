Weekly/bi-weekly discussion posts in class for assignment workshops which include giving feedback to a peer. None of the work is too challenging, he's very understanding and gives a grace period of 48 hours after due date for all major assignments.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwODc0ODI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Hilarious--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Engl1102","date_posted":"2024-12-06 03:49:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great guy. The only work you will have is 5 essays and some short stories to read then talk about the next day in class. If you show up to his office hours for anything and if you show up to class everyday, he will let you redo things you need re-graded. Best English 101 teacher you can get.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTMwOTkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Engl1102","date_posted":"2024-12-02 22:12:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really cool guy, with a laid-back atmosphere in the classroom. Doesn't waste your time with bs work or lectures. Teaches you the material very well. Participation is semi-mandatory (4 free absences).

Instead of a traditional English class, he taught concepts through important, relevant topics. Not a bunch of assignments & they're all easy. The final was based on a project that we completed components for throughout the semester so it was spaced out enough that it wasn't overwhelming. Cancelled class sometimes. Would recommend!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODU5NDQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
