She truly wants you to improve and do well. My class was a hybrid course so we only met once a week. She's light on work and an easy grader. Attendance is mandatory but she gave us 6 free absences.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMDU3ODEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2018-01-23 21:16:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Honestly, Professor Gray is a genuine English professor. Though her class is as rigorous as a normal university English class, she is very mellow and the essays, projects, and work she gives are very easy. If you want an English professor who is very easy to talk to, relateable, supportive, and fun, take Professor Gray.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDk1MDM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2018-01-16 15:28:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Gray is extremely nice and easy going. She can be a bit unorganized but once she lets you know what you're supposed to do exactly the work is simple. You basically work on a research paper all semester and it's a group paper.
