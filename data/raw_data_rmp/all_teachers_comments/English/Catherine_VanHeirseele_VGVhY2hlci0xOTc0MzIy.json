She assigns a ridiculous amount of at home work, gives no extra credit, and makes it very difficult to learn. She is very funny, though.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzE0MzEz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--SO MANY PAPERS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGLISH1102","date_posted":"2016-12-15 12:19:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really nice professor!

She makes her expectations pretty clear and the class isn't all too difficult as long as you do the essay assignments as instructed and show up to class.

There are 4 essays in total, 3 online discussions and dull homework. She drops your 2 lowest in class grades. Save your money and share the textbooks, you will only need them once or twice.

There are only four main assignments. 3 Essays and 1 Annotated Bib. I took her hybrid class and attendance is super important. Miss two classes and you drop a letter grade. All in all, she's a good teacher.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTAzMjg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2015-11-11 10:59:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was an amazing teacher and always willing to assist me on papers and other homework assignments. She also told us that she drops the two lowest homework grades at the end of the year, but the work wasn't too terrible, so if you did the work, showed up, and took the time to do the papers, you got a decent grade.
