This is not an easy A. You earn it. She grades fairly and gives many opportunities to increase your grade. This course is very helpful and she is a GREAT teacher. There is homework and quizzes-but if you try, you can do very well in her class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDgxMjg1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2014-01-06 22:53:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Mathew was an excellent instructor.  She followed very closely to the syllabus and was very responsive to her email.  Her grading was fair and impartial.  Proofreading is crucial to this class.  When posting your peer reviews be sure to use textbook references.

If you do all of the assignments, then you'll be fine. If you don't, there isn't much wiggle room. Everything totaled up to 100 points. That is all. She grades fair and states she is available for questions. It was an experience being online. Next time, I prefer in-class interaction.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTI2Njcz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG2110","date_posted":"2013-11-18 10:10:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy class, there is a lot of work with the quizzes, readings and exams. The material is not difficult and she wants you to succeed. The tests are not even related to the readings, they are more of interpreting readings.

Online quizzes for each reading are simple enough to google answers. Go into the test knowing key terms and have a basic idea of what the stories are about. Can't miss more than 3 classes. Good class, she makes it interesting. Very nice lady.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDYwMzY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL2110","date_posted":"2012-11-11 14:44:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great English class.
