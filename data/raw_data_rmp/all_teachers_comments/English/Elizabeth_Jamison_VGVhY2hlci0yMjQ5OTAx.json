She says upfront she appreciates student involvement, opinions, experiences, etc. in an non intimidating, open discussion setting. She has a coaching style of teaching, letting you know what you do well and where you need some practice.

There were only 11 things we were graded on but she gave us 100's on 2 or 3 of them, I think she ran out of time to grade them. There was a 10 page minimum paper as the final, which wasn't too bad but she takes points for grammar &amp; mispelling, ect. Definately learned a lot about research though!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxODIwNzE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

She gave weekly online assignments but they were not hard.  When you're in the actual class she's readily available to help and provide discussions.  The posts/discussions are pretty cool. You'll enjoy it.
