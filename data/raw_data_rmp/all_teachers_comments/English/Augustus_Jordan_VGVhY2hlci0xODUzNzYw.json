Supposed to be a journal  but halfway through he stopped checking and gave no more grades. The only thing taught is his resume and educational history. Avoid speaking during discussions. Racially motivated and name calling.

I may not be the best at grammar and that's all he grades for. He doesn't teach anything. Hes very rude. He talks about his doctoral degree which is African American studies. He says everything is about race. This is not a debate class its supposed to be composition. He sucks run far away.

There are only 4 papers and extra credit quizzes. If you are looking for a class where you actually learn, take another professor. He's very closed minded and brings race into a lot of things! I would not take him again.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Njg3MDgw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENLISH1101","date_posted":"2014-12-08 19:55:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the easiest class on earth to take.

Quizzes do not count, they're extra credit points that can be added to your papers. In class we usually did journals or peer editing and held class discussions over those activities. He's a nice guy and if you can punctuate and use correct grammar, you'll make an A on every paper! I haven't made less than a 95.

All the quizes you take dont count. The best quiz gets added to your lowest paper so very easy to get an A.

Felt like a middle school English class. We did a journal every class over a topic he thinks of based on personal experiences or current problems. The whole class shares what they wrote and he comments. Sometimes offending. Only three easy papers written about yourself and your major. No final.
