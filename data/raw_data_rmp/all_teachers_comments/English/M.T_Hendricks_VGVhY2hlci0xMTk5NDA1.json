The quizzes suck and he makes it look like they weigh a lot on the syllabus but I had a failing grade in quizzes but made A's on all of my papers. Grades papers tough but fair according to a specific rubric. Lets you write about whatever you want.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjE0OTAw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2011-04-04 13:56:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is his first year teaching an 1102 and it shows. He's very unclear when giving directions. 3 papers that all connect. Feels like your doing the same paper 3 times. Cancels class often. He does daily quizes that you basically have to memorize the text to understand. He is an OKAY proffesor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzUzMzAz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2010-11-11 19:17:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"His class is boring but it's a pretty easy class.

Professor is very laid back and he cancelled class three times the semester. There are a lot of quizzes and reading assignments so buy the books! There are three papers.
