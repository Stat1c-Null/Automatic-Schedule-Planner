Her class lectures are a little boring but she did cancel class on Fridays and really cares about her students. She gives extra credit at the end of the semester and will extend due dates for students that struggle in her class. Great teacher!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzEzNTI5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Caring--So many papers","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2019-10-23 23:04:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Prokopiev is a great teacher who is willing to put in a lot of her own time and effort to see her students succeed. She assigns a bunch of essays but spends most of the in- class time teaching tricks and tips on how to complete them. She gives extra credit at the end of the semester and does give bumps to students she knows and likes.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMzEzNDMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--EXTRA CREDIT--So many papers","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2018-12-03 23:34:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a nice lady, but gives too many essays.
