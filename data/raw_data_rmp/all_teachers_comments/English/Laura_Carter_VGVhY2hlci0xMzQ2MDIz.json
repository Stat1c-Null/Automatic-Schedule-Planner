You only have to write 4 papers and your final is to correct all 4 papers and turn them back in. Just a warning to those who take her 8AM class, DON'T DO IT! I had her for the Fall semester in 09 and she didn't show up for about 10 of the classes. She emailed us hours after the class was over with random excuses.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Nzc2NTY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL001","date_posted":"2010-01-11 12:14:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"barely showed up in class and turned in all my papers and i was still able to correct them by the end of the year.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzA4MzU0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
