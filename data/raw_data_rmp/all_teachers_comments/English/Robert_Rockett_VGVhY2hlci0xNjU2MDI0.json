There are some online and book readings, but as long as you read, there will be quizzes. Only 5 papers, which may seem like a lot, but they are very easy to write. I hate writing and his class made it easy for me. If I could take his class again, I would!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTM1NDQy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGL1101","date_posted":"2012-11-12 13:26:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice guy, he is a bit tough on paper grading from what he says generally you will get a C, but he's willing to help you anytime and this helps boost your grade.

He is fun if you are friendly and is more than willing to help anyway he can as long as you say you are having trouble. Topics are sometimes confusing, but if you are social, you should do well.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNTk3MTIx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1102","date_posted":"2012-04-30 10:48:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would not recommend him.
