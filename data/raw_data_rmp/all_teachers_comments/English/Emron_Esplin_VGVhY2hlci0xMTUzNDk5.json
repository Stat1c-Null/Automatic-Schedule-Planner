Not as much reading as you would expect from a world lit class -- its mostly short stories (ex: Edgar Allen Poe) -- all fantasy/horror stories! One midterm exam that should be easy if you did the reading.  Small quizzes and assignments in class.  Lots of small group discussions about the reading assignments. I definitely recommend!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0ODM2MDMw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
