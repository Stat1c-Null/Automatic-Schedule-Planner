I wish that she had a more structured way of grading. Most of the people who complain are the ones who never go to class. Go to class ask questions and just try and get the best understanding of what she wants. Would take again if the circumstances arise.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDk5NDk3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENG1101","date_posted":"2016-12-12 21:31:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"I tried to give her a chance but she is actually the worst professor ever. None of her dates in the syllabus matched when things were actually due, and she never told us anything. She is a really tough grader. I took all AP English classes throughout high school and never got below a 95 and she wrote all my papers were \"too wordy\".
