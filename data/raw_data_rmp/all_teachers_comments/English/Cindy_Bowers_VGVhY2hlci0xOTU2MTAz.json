We have quizzes once a week, 2 tests, and 2 papers. She attempts to have open discussions but completely shuts down any idea that doesn't coincide with hers. Likewise, this shows on her quizzes too. If you don't write what you think she wants to hear, you will fail.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NzI0NDg2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ENGL3100","date_posted":"2015-08-25 10:42:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Had a blast in her class. Very open discussions, I always thought I was prepared for class and then during class discussions I felt very not prepared... but that being said, she sees effort and she loves to keep discussion judgement-free. She loves interesting people and will point them out. She's very funny, relaxed, JUST DO YOUR HOMEWORK.
