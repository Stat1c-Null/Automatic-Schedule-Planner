He was so unclear and did not follow the syllabus at all. His tests were impossiable and you never get your work back to study with. There is a lot of reading in this class. His grading doesn't make any sense at all. Just don't take his class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MTUxMDg4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"HIST2110","date_posted":"2007-12-18 22:47:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"very time consuming and often useless because the test was so far away from the class disussion and assignments.
