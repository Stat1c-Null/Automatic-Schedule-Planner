Professor Jackson is a very different and non-traditional teacher. I think that these reviews are bad because the things we discuss in class are heavy, some people aren't mature enough to handle this. Jackson doesn't just teach, they practice it outside of school as well","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTgyNTc5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2019-12-18 21:37:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very political class, however did cover interesting topics. Very unorganized, offered extra credit but not doable if you have a busy schedule. Never knew what my grade was through the entire course. She does not believe in rubrics so good luck writing the papers. Always agree with her or else. However, she does know the course material very well.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzA5OTE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"LOVEANDSEX1101","date_posted":"2019-03-26 17:28:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"One quiz every week based off of the textbook. You will not pass the class if you do not read the book, but it is doable it is one chapter per week. There is an extra credit opportunity at the end of the semester. She does not take late work. There are a couple discussion board posts. Your post has to be 500 words and your response has to be 250.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDgxNjUx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2018-12-03 18:26:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"She secretly makes changes grading guidelines for papers a few days before its due. Ive had 2 papers where she changed the topic we where to write on and/or how the paper will be graded literally days before its due. Her critique of your work is whether she agrees.

I would not take this professor. This class is just taking quizzes from the book, doing an occasional discussion post (250 words), and an essay or 2. Again, the grading seems very random to me with no clear rubrics given. She clearly doesn't put time into the class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODE3MDgy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2018-07-05 13:14:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"I recommend that everyone steer clear of this professor. If you are interested in this course, do yourself a favor and take it with another professor who is more open minded. You would think that the person teaching this course is open to discussion, however if your views do no align then she gets angry.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzIxNzMz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2018-03-03 21:32:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"The most substantial advice I can give is to accept some of the content at face value even if you disagree. A few points made by the text seem like blanket-statements or arguably close-minded, but the content in this class doesn't really have black/white answers, which can be weird to accept. Not a biggest fan of the quiz questions either.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjE3NTQz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2018-01-23 21:24:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Be ready to have an open mind. Most of her lectures are class discussions. Also, be ready to type, write, and work hard. She will toughly grade your essays, but it is for you to improve your writing which really does help.

She is an extremely tough grader &amp; talks bad about her online students with her in person class students. If you have an opinion she does not like, prepare to fail because everything offends her.

There is a lot of reading involved but there isn't much substance to the class. Her grading is very biased, as well, based more on her understanding. I could not find an equal ground with her.
