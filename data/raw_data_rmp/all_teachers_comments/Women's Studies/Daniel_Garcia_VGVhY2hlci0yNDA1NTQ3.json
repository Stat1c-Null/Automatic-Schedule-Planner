You have to read from selected pieces a little bit but it's worth it because you actually learn things you've never considered before. The man is hilarious and was a great professor. Made sure we understood everything and had very casual quizzes each week and tests (just a midterm and final).

He makes his lectures super interesting and he actually cares about his students. If you have any issues just go up and talk to him. Make sure you do the readings and you will do great.

You should definitely take him if you want to broaden your knowledge about race and gender. It's really interesting and makes you think. I loved every moment in this class. 10 quizzes, one question.

This class does focus more on race and gender than love and sex, but it is so worth it. Daniel makes the class interesting and fun, and actually engages us.

He changed the curriculum to make the class only about Gender and Feminism, which is an interesting topic that he taught well, but not what I signed up for.

Only need to do a few short readings every week then come back to discuss them in class. Will need the books but can get cheap on amazon. Don't be fooled- this guy knows what he's talking about.
