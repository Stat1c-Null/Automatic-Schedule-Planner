Everything is based on a textbook, but it's online so you don't need to purchase it. Easy A, but she's NOT accessible. She messed up a quiz and the whole class emailed her, separately, and she took weeks to get back to us to open another one. Grades hard on discussions... I got an A, but what a lazy teacher.

Every discussion you post must have a source, her discussions alone brought my grade down 2 letter points. If this is not a requirement, dont take it. She offers a nice extra credit opportunity near the end of the semester but it's still not even worth it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDAwMzc4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2020-10-21 18:20:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I would not take this professor ever again. She doesn't explain criteria and then grades very harshly, or she takes off points after you actually did something. She deletes discussions when she grades them so you can't check back on them. She doesn't teach, it's essentially reading a boring book and getting bad grades on quizzes on it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzIxMzMz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GWST3030","date_posted":"2020-04-27 00:11:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her for an online class in gender and popular culture, which I thought would be an interesting class for my last semester of college.

She is very difficult to reach by email in a very content heavy course. She probably said 4 things to help direct our class throughout the semester which is just sad and lazy.

The class had discussions, quizzes, and a final. The quizzes were easy, but were not worth much towards your grade. Then, the discussions were graded way too tough.

It was mostly quizzing that is based on the powerpoints available in class. Easy to pass if you are able to commit. We rarely had discussion posts, so it was easy to forget to reply to others.
