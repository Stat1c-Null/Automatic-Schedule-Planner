She shows very boring documentaries and only presents topics through her narrow perspective. The readings are very long and actually required. She grades the final paper really easily, but I did not enjoy this class at all.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjY3NTE2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Beware of pop quizzes--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"WGST14004","date_posted":"2013-11-18 15:59:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"P Gupta is a guest professor at Georgetown University in DC this semester. She is very quiet and awkward during her lectures. The reading material she assigns is very out of date so it makes it less interesting doing the homework. There are reading quizzes once a week. You don't have to try very hard in class- most people just go on their computers","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzM4NTEy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST3080","date_posted":"2013-03-19 11:33:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Gupta is awesome! She never puts students down for having their own beliefs, but she will teach you how to back up your opinion with scholarship. She is very knowledgeable about the subjects she teaches.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDI0Mjg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST3080","date_posted":"2012-12-08 04:15:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"No complaints. There is no reason not to take her class, enjoy her lectures, learn about masculinity, and make a good grade. Unless you don't like Gender Studies. Then it can get a little awkward. :)","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTg5NDU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST3080","date_posted":"2012-11-21 00:10:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ms. Gupta is new at KSU. Shes young (mid-late 20s) so she is pretty cool. Her class is pretty much lecture but she will give pop quizzes so just make sure you read the required material. You are graded on participation, a powerpoint, and about 3-4 reading responses! I like her!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODcxNTIx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
