She assigns long readings with very difficult quizzes every week. While it is obvious she is very intelligent and knows her stuff, I would avoid her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTQ0Njk4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2013-09-23 01:12:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"She makes the class harder than it has to be. The class is titled love and sex it's kind of misleading because you are not really talking about what you think you will be talking about. The class is interesting but there is a lot of reading and her tests are NOT multiple choice if you can find another teacher I would recommend taking someone else.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTM0NzQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
