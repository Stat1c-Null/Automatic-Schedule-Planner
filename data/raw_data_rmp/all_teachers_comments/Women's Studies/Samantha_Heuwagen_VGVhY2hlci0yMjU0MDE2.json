NO TESTS.. Final is OPTIONAL to help your grade if needed. (Final brought my grade to an A!) Attendance is 15% of your overall grade, and you only get 1 free absence.. I missed a few classes and had a Zero in attendance but still managed to get an A. A few group discussions in class followed by a class debate.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTE5NDUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GRADED BY FEW THINGS--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2018-05-13 19:33:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a choice for a professor of L&amp;S, but she has her moments.

The textbook is pretty expensive, so find somewhere to rent it for a good price. Also, it was a lot of reading because the chapters were long, but most of the time, I would just skim through for 10-15 minutes because it wasn't difficult information.
