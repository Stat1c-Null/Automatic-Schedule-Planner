I took her for a 6 week online course and usually those courses are super fast paced and rigorous, but she made the course load super manageable! Graded by weekly discussion posts+peer responses, one film review of your choice, and a final paper. Super lenient grader and is pretty easy to reach via email.

The class mostly consists of a discussion post and every other week and one student reply. There's two papers in the entire class, including a final paper instead of an exam. A lot of the stuff we have to read is really interesting and dives into unexpected topics.

No tests, the entire course is made up of Discussion Posts and two papers. Each module is two weeks and covers two theorists that you will then have to write a DP about and respond to two others. I enjoy writing, so this did not bother me.

So many extra credit opportunities, an incredibly lenient grader (I got a 100 on everything) and such a kind professor. She also gave out several extensions. Amy is an insightful professor but also cares deeply about her students. Easily the best prof I've ever had. I never read or bought the textbook, fwiw.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODAwMDM3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Inspirational--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
