Reading discussion due every week and 2 responses plus short quizzes that were easy. She was sweet and gives extra credit at the end! I would definitely retake her again!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNTMxMjE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLCK1102","date_posted":"2025-05-14 20:36:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"2 group projects, 3 forum short-essays, 3 discussion posts, and a final project/paper. Lecture and content was interesting and engaging. Liked to have open discussions about the readings. Had to do two group projects, weren't that bad. Doesn't take attendance but will do attendance quizzes if too many people stop coming. Relatable and funny","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjg0MTAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLCK1102","date_posted":"2025-04-19 04:08:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Easy A. There are 2 group projects and one final solo project. No exams! She has weekly readings. I never read one, i skimmed through before class and that was enough. theres three 500-word writing assignments for the whole semester and like 2 discussions. The course is light work and she's a fun teacher. lectures are fun, easy to go to class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTgwODY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Amazing lectures ","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST-3020","date_posted":"2024-10-23 01:15:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Weekly work was a little excessive for an online class. (1-3)15-pg reading/ discussion due wednesday. Reading logs/questions of readings, 2 discussion responses, and short quiz question+sample answer+explanation due Sunday.
