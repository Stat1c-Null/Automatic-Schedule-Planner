It's very frustrating because her first 3 quizzes are so hard they really hurt your grade from the very beginning. Then randomly, all of her quizzes become easy A's but your grade is still hurting from the 1st ones. Offers extra credit every module for 2 points each. SLOWEST grader ever.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDQ0Mjc5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Tests are tough","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GWST3OO1","date_posted":"2017-04-29 19:29:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Venell is a brilliant professor who is passionate, hard-working and knowledgeable about the subjects that she teaches in. Taking this class on Feminist Science Theory with her has opened my eyes to a whole knew field of study I hadn't previously considered. Everyone interested in gender and women's studies should take a class with Dr. Venell.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTYxNzMx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST3010","date_posted":"2017-02-20 17:31:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved her class. It was a small class, so we all sort of got to know one another. It's probably the only class that I looked forward to, because she had us all participate in our controversial discussions. These discussions made the content more intriguing, and much easier to learn.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3ODQyNjgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Inspirational--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2016-12-13 22:16:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was interesting to listen to sometimes. I didn't get any of the books required but I somehow got 2 A's and a B on all 3 essays, so its definitely doable to not do the readings and get a decent grade. She gives random in class discussions that are kinda hard. Overall I'd take her again but you kinda gotta give some effort with her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDc5NDEy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES--SO MANY PAPERS--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2016-09-22 02:29:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Have no idea what will be going on in this class. All you do is read a whole bunch of different books throughout the semester. Barely have to go to class to pass. Only have 3 papers and final presentation. Doesn't really teach the subject well.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2OTg3NTQ5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2016-07-25 21:15:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"There's a lot of reading in the class.

Her classes are pretty easy, but she will stress you out by not grading assignments until the end of the year. She made class interesting, and I would recommend her. She's funny too.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODI4ODY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2016-05-12 12:23:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is really not a hard class. There are no test. Weekly discussion boards. There is a lot of reading. She takes a long time to grade your work. If you email her, she takes a while to reply. Overall the class is very interesting.

All of the reading are PDFs on D2L, so there's no textbook. The class is very interesting and she does a great job of keeping you interested in the subject. Queer theory is kind of a nebulous subject matter, but she is very passionate about it and willing to help. She's very nice and quirky.
