And as long as you attend class, there is a lot of extra credit. She also cancels class a lot, which is nice. 4 papers, no tests, 3 discussion posts, and one quiz every week. I thought the lectures were really boring, but I still learned a lot.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjM1OTA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--SO MANY PAPERS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2016-12-07 15:28:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"You have weekly reading quizzes, 3 or 4 discussion posts, and 3-5 page papers to write over the books. She is very fair about how she handles student issues. You'll know about extra credit and what to expect upfront; there will be no surprises.

There are no tests, just 4 papers (3-5 pages) that are not difficult, 3 discussion posts, and weekly online reading quizzes (about 5 questions) that are all easy 100s.

Show up to class because you're only allowed like 6 absences. Class is all discussion but mainly her talking. You go into detail about gender, love and sex (obviously). Only 3-4 papers 3-5 pages long, very easy. Weekly reading quizzes due, usually  5 questions and easy. This class is a great for gen ed!!

In class she leads great, interactive and engaging discussions. Surely one of the better Profs I've had at KSU. She is fair and gives every opportunity to make an A.

You can only miss 3 classes before being penalized. SHE DOES NOT TAKE LATE WORK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE (even emergencies)! It's an easy course if you just show up to class.

Watched movies and had discussions during class.

I loved her class because she opens up the floor for discussions and opinions all the time. We have weekly readings and quizzes but theyre not hard at all. There are no tests; just 4 essays.
