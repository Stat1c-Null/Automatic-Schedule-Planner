Not meant for children with thin skin and XVII century political views. Easiest humanities class ever. Get ready to critically analyze STEM and learn a thing or two about science done by people who aren't male and white.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2OTgzNjI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":8,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2016-08-09 23:12:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Siobhan's class is awesome! She's very helpful and stays posted up at Starbucks in Social Science before class if you have any questions or concerns. I would definitely recommend this this class.

Don't be afraid of her naturally sarcastic tone. She also cusses so don't freak out. Only 2 major assignments and 4 journal entries with articles every night.

I dropped her class before midterms. She gives long articles to read sometimes two each class. You have to come to class with the articles, if you don't and she does a spot check you get a 0. Also, she did not clarify what details to know, and has a sarcastic tone when you ask questions.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NjQ4MTE1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2015-12-01 21:09:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Siobhan is a great teacher if you enjoy Gender and Women's Studies because if you don't then you'll be bored. Long readings twice a week with very short easy quiz on them. One mid semester assessment, easy if you pay attention and read. One paper as final. Not a super easy class. Must work for your grade. Totally worth it if you work for it. Loved!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTE4OTky","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2015-11-04 18:48:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Siobhan is very passionate about the topics she teaches. She gives lots of readings and then pop quizzes on those readings. She usually lectures for a long time but also loves feedback and opinions of others. You have to submit 4 summaries on any 4 of the readings. There is 1 test at on keywords and then a final paper.  She is really hilarious too.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQ0NDg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1100","date_posted":"2015-07-22 11:29:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her lectures are engaging and she loves class feedback - she will honestly get upset if people are not participating. Her grading is meticulous but the assignments are easy and assigned way in advance of the due dates. She is young and funny, understands students have a life outside the classroom.

I would NEVER take a gender women's studies class again in my life. I took it as an elective and i regret it 100%. If you want to keep your sanity, GPA up, and not go to jail, lol - do NOT take her.

I have no idea why anyone would give them a bad rate. Siobhan is very intelligent and well-versed in gender studies; They assign fun readings for the class. Sure, there's a pop quiz in almost every class, but if you're playing with a full deck, they're not hard.
