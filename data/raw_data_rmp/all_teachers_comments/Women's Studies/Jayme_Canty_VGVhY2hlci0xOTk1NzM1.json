She did stray from the normal &#8220;Love & Sex&#8221; category and did talk more about race. Assignments were SUPER easy just required a bit of reading. She gave so much extra credit that I did it all and my 82 went to a 91.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTAzODUw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--EXTRA CREDIT--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"GWST1102","date_posted":"2024-12-28 20:17:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst professor I've had so far. Everything was graded on her opinion and she gave terrible/no feedback for improvement either. Pretty sure she has some superiority complex over students which causes her to poorly grade responses she doesn't agree with. She also made a lot of the class about race.
