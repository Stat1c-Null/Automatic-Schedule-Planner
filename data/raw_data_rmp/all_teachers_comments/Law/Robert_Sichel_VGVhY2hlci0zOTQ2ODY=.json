He lets you use 2 pages of notes for all exams (no limits on font or margin sizes) and gives extra problems so you can get over a 100. He also gives a curve.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTI2NDE5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2008-11-07 21:06:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"AMAZING!!!
