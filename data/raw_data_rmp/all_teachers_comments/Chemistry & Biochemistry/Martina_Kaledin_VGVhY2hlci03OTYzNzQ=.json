She has a hard time explaining things, very confusing class you'll get lost very easily within a few minutes into the lecture. Goes very fast and even if she explains things, it's still very hard to understand. Dont take this professor if you want to get an A in this class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMDE1Mjk3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212","date_posted":"2006-05-05 10:40:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Kaledin-Very nice person but lacks teaching skills.People in the class have a very hard time understanding the material because is she very hard to understand and she zooms past all the material in seconds.The lecture is very boring overall and by the final, you really aren't prepared.The average on the final was 45/100. not good!
