Daily assignments (for summer) and a final exam that you go over before. She can be really picky with major assignments and stuff. She says you can ask questions but she made me feel dumb when I did.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0OTQ0Mjg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2020-11-24 18:59:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Talley is very sweet! As an online class you will use Flipgrid a lot. We has zoom meetings, which were short and informational. She give you things to do sheets for each week and the work load is very manageable. As long as you do the work for her class you should get a good grade. She is reachable through email and responds quickly.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODgyNjk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2020-11-02 06:13:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"I do not know why she has a bad rating. I took her 4 week summer class and it was one of the easiest I have taken at KSU. Super sweet lady. Clear instructions, simple assignments, easy grader. Not a heavy lecture.

I took her for a 4 week session online due to the virus and she made it so simple and easy to understand what we had to do. This was a really easy and fun class.

This is the rudest most unprofessional professor I've ever had at KSU. She has taught me what I DONT want to be as a teacher.
