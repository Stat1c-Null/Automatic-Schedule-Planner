The homework is time consuming but it only lasts for half the semester i think. You have to attend 3 concerts over the semester and write papers about them.

He takes into consideration students beginner status with music (if applicable) and is very flexible with assignments. All he really wants from the students is interest and participation. He wants you to do homework for the first few weeks but that's it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODI3NjE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Amazing lectures --Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1107","date_posted":"2023-11-11 03:37:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is soooo cool. We only had like one group project that was super easy. The lectures could gear more towards student participation but other than that I like it.

He cares about your performance. He makes work easy. He doesn't like exams, so the graded work in the course is mostly projects and essays. He is also an easy grader.

Even when there were some mishaps throughout the year, Professor Tighe always went out of his way to rectify any issue. He even took full responsibility and apologized for certain issues.
