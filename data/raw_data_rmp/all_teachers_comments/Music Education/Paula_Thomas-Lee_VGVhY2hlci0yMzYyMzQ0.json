There are 3 teaching assignments, a final based on playing the recorder, random quizzes, a vocab midterm and a music education project, all of which are very easy and she guides you. Very fun class and gets you way out of your comfort zone!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzgwNDE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Hilarious","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2018-05-21 20:11:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very bubbly and out going. She teaches the class like a real elementary school music room so there is singing, dancing, and playing instruments. There are 3 teaching presentations (one as a group) and a mid term.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTY0Mjc0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2018-04-17 08:55:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. T-Lee is a delightful teacher. I was nervous about this class because it is an Elementary Music Education class- there was singing, dancing, and chanting rhymes. We also got to play instruments. She was very clear about her expectations and I 100% recommend taking her class. It was a joy to learn.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODE5MTgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
