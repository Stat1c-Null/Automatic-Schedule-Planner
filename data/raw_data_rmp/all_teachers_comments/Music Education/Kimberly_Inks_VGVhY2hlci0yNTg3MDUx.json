I'll give her kudos to the amount of detail that she included in her instructions, but as a result, it was extremely unclear for us. She snaps at you if you ask a question that she &quot;discussed&quot; in class so I stopped trying to approach her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjA3MTYx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MUED3301","date_posted":"2020-05-03 22:07:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Inks is the worst professor I've ever had. It's amazing they let her anywhere near kids, considering how awful she was to us. She's extremely critical, rude, and discouraging. Everything has to be exactly how she wants it or else it's wrong. She won't hesitate to belittle you in front of your peers. She's everything that's wrong with education.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTkxMDQ2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MUED3301","date_posted":"2020-04-29 02:47:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was by far the worst class experience I have ever had in college. I usually NEVER criticize teachers, because I always try to give them the benefit of the doubt when applicable. However, I cant anymore with Dr. Inks. She is rude, condescending, passive aggressive and extremely disrespectful and belittling to her students. Avoid at all costs.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTUzMTY2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MUED3301","date_posted":"2020-04-27 13:50:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr Inks is not a professor you should take. She makes passive aggressive comments in class, discusses students grades in front of the class, unclear on assignments, grades harshly when instructions were unclear or not discussed , and is disrespectful and belittles students in front of the class.

Some words to describe her are; rude, disrespectful, biased, passive aggressive, condescending, and a plethora of other negative adjectives. Will make you feel like a bad student and a bad teacher. Brings shame to music educators everywhere. Very few positive qualities.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDkwMzUx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
