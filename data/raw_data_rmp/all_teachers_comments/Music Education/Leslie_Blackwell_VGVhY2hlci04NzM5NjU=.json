She's lively and engaged in trying to make everyone understand the elements of music. I took her in a maymester. Lots of quizzes, but are all very easy. Most of them are done in class. Just have to be able to sit through it all. She doesn't care about the grade, she just hopes you learn.

The sweetest woman you'll ever meet in Kennesaw. Although she has her sharp side.  I've always like too sing, but she just put a fire under that \"like\" and ignited something more. She's very inspirational and can easily be a role model for music majors.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDQxMDE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI1149","date_posted":"2017-01-09 14:09:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"I didnt have this class. I had a friend who took it and I sat in on all of their classes, however, Blackwell is so amazing that I still felt the need to post. She captures the entire chorus and brings the best out of everyone as a group and as individuals. Shes brilliant, funny, and full of a charisma that makes the class beyond enjoyable. 5 stars.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzAwMTc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Audit/No Grade","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUSI3380","date_posted":"2014-11-10 09:57:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing ensemble.
