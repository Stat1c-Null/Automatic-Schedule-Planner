Whoever said he wasn't a good prof didn't want to work/learn at all. Bruce tells you exactly what to expect and in turn, he rewards those who work hard. He doesn't spoon feed you but he gives you the vital tools necessary to succeed. :)","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4OTU3ODk1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MEBU3100","date_posted":"2011-05-10 19:49:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Bruce says what he means and means what he says.

Obviously the previous post was written by someone who does not understand &quot;Fundamentals&quot; classes cover broad scopes of the topic at hand.

None of the speakers had anything to do with another and there was nothing in specific we were supposed to learn.
