The final group project was a cross curricular lesson plan for 3 days.  That was probably the hardest assignment the whole semester. Once again, she is such a sweet lady!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTYyMTUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2010-05-04 14:49:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was ridiculously easy. She gives TONS of extra credit opportunities, a few easy assignments on which the due dates are very flexible, easy group project...I loved her, take her to meet your gen ed art requirements, you WILL get an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTE4Mjc5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2010-04-21 16:40:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Gill is a nice person but I don't think I've ever had a more boring class. She reads straight from her PowerPoints and tests are basically questions on a PowerPoint slide where you write down answers on a scantron. Pretty easy class but if you're looking for something interesting, this is not your class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDM0Nzc1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2010-04-21 16:19:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Sign in and leave.  Boring class, do the 4 or 5 event papers (you can pretty much make them up if you're good at it), three tests (questions in powerpoint format), one group powerpoint presentation project.  DO NOT BUY THE BOOK.  Waste of money, DID NOT EVEN OPEN IT.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDM0NTk2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ARED3306","date_posted":"2010-01-16 12:10:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a sweet woman but sometimes a little hard to understand with the accent. Disorganized so you will have to keep asking when the due date is. She understands a work load and will accomidate if you need more time. Lots of fun projects but almost pointless.

Her accent was sometimes hard to understand, changes due dates often & requires a music, theater, & 2 art event reports that were really annoying bc she gave almost no time to do them. Nice person, willing to work w/ you - didnt like the class though","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDYwNTQx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2009-06-29 15:33:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very confusing and will tell you one date when she means another. She goes very fast when lecturing and has an accent that is sometimes hard to understand. She knows a lot about what is in the book...but not really about much else. She's an interesting person, but not a great teacher.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDAxNjY3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3309","date_posted":"2009-05-09 15:45:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class should have focused on how to integrate art into the ECE classroom.  Instead we did useless art projects and papers. Dr. Gill lectured from powerpoint presentations, and we never used the textbook.  Disorganized, does not allow enough time for MAJOR projects and doesn't provide enough explanation about these assignments.
