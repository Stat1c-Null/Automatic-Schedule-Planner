I loved this class even though I am not a musical person.... although she tells you almost everyday how \"musically intelligent\" you are :) She is so sweet and helpful. Very encouraging and not condescending at all when we totally messed up the recorder. (I am terrible!) I wish I could have her for another class. Take her!!

The class is not hard, but do your work.  I really bomb the recorder sharing at the end of the semester and she was pretty nice about it. If you suck at music, like me, just let her see that you tried. Also, she always asked us if we needed extra help. Now that the class is over. It was pretty fun.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzI0Nzc3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2011-04-28 21:00:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wonderful, fun teacher, content expert, realistic and concerned with each individuals learning progress.

LOVES music.  (-) She only has 1 assignment that focuses on music integration into lessons.  The rest are trying to teach us to be &quot;music&quot; teachers.  You can only miss ONE class or you will be docked 25 points from your final grade.  You could make A's all semester & end up with a B.

The class itself is silly, but she does a great job of teaching it, and puts the focus on the application in the classroom. She is very supportive and willing do whatever is necessary for you to do well in her class if you put forth the effort as well!
