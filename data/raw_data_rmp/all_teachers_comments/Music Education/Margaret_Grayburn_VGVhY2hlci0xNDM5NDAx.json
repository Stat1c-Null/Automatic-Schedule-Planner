There was way too much work, she was unclear what she wanted from you, and if you weren't musically talented then there goes you're easy A. She expected you to be able to read music by then end of her class, and was mad if you couldn't. She is rude and unclear do NOT take this class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Njg5Nzg4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2010-11-04 09:03:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"A ton of work for a 2 hour credit course.  Only one exam, pretty easy if you study.  Not clear on most of the lesson plans and assignments, no concrete information.  Attendance is mandatory.  Some extra credit is available.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NzI2ODM5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2010-10-20 11:15:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"There are way too many assignments for this class and it's only a 2 hour credit course! You must present 2 lesson plans, 1 song, and a PTA program. Along with playing 2 songs from the recorder and a song from the autoharp. Plus, you must observe 2 music classes, grades K-2, and 3-5. WAY TOO MUCH WORK!!! Can't wait until this class is over.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjczOTU3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MUED3340","date_posted":"2010-07-11 14:08:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great class, great prof.  Didn't know there was so much to learn about teaching music.  Assignments very helpful.  Almost everyone earned an A.

More assignments than the other teachers teaching this class.  Rushed through material. Was impatient, rigid. Very difficult test.
