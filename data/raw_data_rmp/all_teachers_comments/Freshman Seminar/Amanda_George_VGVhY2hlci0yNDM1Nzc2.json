She is a really sweet lady and made this class more enjoyable than expected and brought us food sometimes. The only thing that bothered me about her is that sometimes she was moody and our final is a 2-4 page paper, while other seminar classes are taking a 20 question test.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODcxNDY0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?
