I took her for AMP KSU 1101. There are several projects but none of them are very difficult. 3 easy presentations. Easy A as long as you do your stuff. You only use the book for the midterm and final which are both online w/o lockdown browser.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzY0ODU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-11-08 14:37:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing person, and really down to earth. She is very understanding so if you have a problem just let her know and she works something out with you. You don't need the book but you should definitely go to class and do the work.

Everything is on D2L, and if you leave this class with anything but an A, you are doing something wrong. The only thing to be aware of is that she takes heavy attendance, and if you miss more than 3 classes, every absence after that your grade goes down a letter grade. But she's super funny and helpful. Would recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTIzNTE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-11-02 21:37:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Santoro is a really good professor, she is really funny, resourceful, cares about her students, and will do anything to help you out.

She is extremely helpful with not just her class but all of your classes. She doesn't assign any difficult work at all and actually helps you learn how to get around the college and life in general.
