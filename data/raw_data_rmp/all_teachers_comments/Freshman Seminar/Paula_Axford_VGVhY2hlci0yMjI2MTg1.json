She actually devoted the class to helping us get a good start in our college career. She brought in many guest speakers on campus to help us learn more about the many different things KSU. She taught us how to mange heavy work loads and handle complex professors. She is defiantly the one to take.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTI2NTQz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-01-15 18:18:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet. Workload is very minimal. Lectures are massively inspirational and totally engaging. They are also related to real world situations that will help you be successful thru your college career and beyond. Overall, a great human being. No reason you should get anything less than an A. Unless you just don't show up.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzM0NDcx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?
