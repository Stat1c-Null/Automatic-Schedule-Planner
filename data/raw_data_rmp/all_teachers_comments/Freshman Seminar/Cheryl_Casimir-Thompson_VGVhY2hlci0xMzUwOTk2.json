I am the kind of person that ALWAYS comes to class no matter what and always gets A's, but in this case, that doesnt help at all. She grades essays and papers unfairly and even if its perfect, she takes off 20 points because as she says &quot;College isnt perfect and you'll never get the perfect grade&quot;.

Unless you memorize the chapters, you will fail due to her inability to emphasize which points will be tested on. Students basically teach themselves & eachother.

She has an attitude when the students ask question and answers as if she's trying to make them feel stupid. As for the class.. It really is a joke but mandatory for some. Just makes it all the more painful to go when the teacher is full of herself.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjA0NjM0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2010-01-06 22:55:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"WORSE TEACHER EVER!  If I combined all the bad qualities of all my teacher it still wouldn't equal her.  LETS just say that EVERYONE in BOTH her classes BOMBED her first test which is 1/5 of the TOTAL GRADE, &quot;NO CURVE&quot;. Totally study the book that is where all the questions come from. She gives NO FEEDBACK your papers come back clear.

Very disorganized, late to class quite often, tests are random and much harder than they should be. She doesn't listen if you're confused or have a question. She gives grades, but gives 0 feedback on all class work. If i had known how she was in the beginning, i would have dropped her class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2Njc4NTY4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2009-12-11 21:43:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very boring class! She's often very unclear about what she wants, so some ppl got bad grades. I would not recommend her, if you can take another teacher do it. She didnt leave the classroom when we were evaluating her (even though she's suppossed to and we asked her to do it)she kept walking around.

Tough to rate. She's an extremely nice person, but her style is too old-school for this class. Attendance mandatory. Come in, sit down, be quiet. Teach from dry PPTs. Didn't always follow syllabus.

I'd like to see what she could do with a more thought-provoking subject with a structured format.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDY5Mzc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2009-12-03 18:52:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is very nice as a person but very unclear of what assignments need to be done.
