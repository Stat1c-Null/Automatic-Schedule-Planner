I have learned almost nothing from taking this course but at least it's a GPA booster. Weekly discussion posts, four reading assessments about a seemingly unrelated book and two tests. Take him if you're satisfying the last of your LDRS credits, you have nothing to lose.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjMwNTUx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-05-10 13:31:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Ford is very easy going and is great at making students feel comfortable.

He was a WONDERFUL professor and overall made this class enjoyable. Lots of assignments but never any boring lectures which is good. Grades very leniently and is very generous with extra credit. I would take him again in a heartbeat! Also loved the bond he made with my class during the semester.

Very funny guy. He kept the class interesting even through the boring PowerPoint lectures. He gives a lot of work, but trust me its all worth it in the end. He's very specific but very helpful and always there for you if you need help. He's not boring at all and makes class super fun.

Does't give a ton of lectures and likes students to be involved. Gives several assignments but knows you can complete them. If you listen to what he says, then you will understand he wants his students to exceed at the highest level possible.
