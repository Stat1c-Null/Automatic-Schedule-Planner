She makes you do 10 reflections over the course and makes you do a volunteer activity as well.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzQyNzk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"SO MANY PAPERS--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-12-03 20:07:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Actually the best instructor I have ever had. Very nice and understanding and respectable, but she still sticks to the rules and course guidelines.  She likes to do fun activities, sometimes outside.  And be prepared to play a fun game for her to blow your mind with how relevant it is to the topic you're learning about.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzIyNDEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Hilarious--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-11-22 12:53:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"TAKE HER NO MATTER WHAT. Probably my favorite person ever.  Literally hilarious & I am sad to leave her class :( She is young so she is awesome with relating with students.  Easy grading and the class is almost impossible not to do well in.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MjQxNTA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Hilarious","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2016-11-14 23:55:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ms. Harvill is the best professor ever!!! She makes class interesting and loves hearing stories about us. She is very outgoing which makes class that much better. Read the chapters and you'll be good. Participation is key! Reflections are fun to write. Don't worry they're easy just like all the assignments she gives.

She's super funny, and actually cares about what she's talking about. She tries to make class fun and interesting, and is pretty young and can relate to college students pretty well. I would definitely have her as a teacher again, because she was the only teacher this semester that I enjoyed. Would definitely recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTQ3NTI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
