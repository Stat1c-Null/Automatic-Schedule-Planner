She lets class out early by at least 15 minutes every time. All assignments are incredibly easy. The midterm and final were also easy. Open book final. Easiest A. Ever.

She's always energetic even though it would be like 9:30 in the morning. Assignments are not hard at all. You'll right like 5 essays (campus events).
