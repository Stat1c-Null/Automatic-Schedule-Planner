She was by far my favorite professor for my first semester. At first her class seemed like a lot of work, and it was, but it was all really easy! 10 online discussions (really easy) and other projects. Just follow the syllabus, she makes it clear on what she wants. I would take her class again if I could!

The catch is all of the projects you have to do over the course of the semester. They're not hard at all but gets to be overwhelming on top of all your other classes.
