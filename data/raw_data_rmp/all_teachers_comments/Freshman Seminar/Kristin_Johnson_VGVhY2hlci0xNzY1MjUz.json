She's a nice lady and grades fairly. Two project presentations, one for countries and one for Justice book. The latter pissed me off so much. Overall 3/5 not an easy A but I've heard of worse teachers.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzI1MjQw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2013-11-13 21:22:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"All together Mrs. Johnson was an easy teacher. Sometimes I felt that she had no clue what she was doing, and I could have taught the class myself. DO ALL OF THE WORK. Some kids in my class failed from skipping assignments. Read the chapters in your book before the tests because her notes aren't detailed enough.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzEyMjE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2012-11-18 00:53:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Highly recommended","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODU2Njg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1100","date_posted":"2012-11-12 13:23:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very nice, assignments aren't hard and she's always willing to work with you about the assignments just bring it up as a class or individually after class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODE3NDY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
