You actually just had to show up, listen, and eventually turn in your papers and you would pass this class. She was also super sweet and funny and you could tell she cared about the students.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMzk1NTA4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2019-01-08 14:25:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"For those who have to take the KSU Seminar (which I am pretty sure is everyone going to KSU), this is a professor you have to take. She is hilarious in the class and she is very understanding with just about everything. She has taught a lot of things that will stick with me throughout my college run and I am forever thankful for her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMjIyMDAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-12-19 03:05:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super funny and cool, but the class was such a chore. You dont have to do any hard work at all, but everything is so easy you forget to do it.

She is very caring and understands you have other classes to prioritize. There are a bit of assignments, all online, but EXTREMELY EASY. I made 100's on every single assignment in her class, and exempted the final. Also, no tests!

I showed up everyday, idk what grade those who didn't got. Don't get the textbook; just ask a friend for the occasional activity page. One group project and group paper with assigned partners but y'all get to pick the topic so its not bad. Just participate and you'll do fine.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDQyNTYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-12-09 14:10:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Cade is a wonderful educator. She is kind and playful and passionate about the area she teaches. The course is fairly simple, and she makes it entertaining. She always wants to hear her students' opinions which means a lot, and she cares about each of her students. She's accessible outside of class and wants everyone to pass.
