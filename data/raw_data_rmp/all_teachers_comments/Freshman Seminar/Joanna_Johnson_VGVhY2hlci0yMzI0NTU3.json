Also we had the choice to make a video or do essay questions for the final and sadly, my class did the video. It was really challenging and stressful to do the video. She's a good professor but it is mindless work and not so fun.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTE4Mjk0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-12-13 20:06:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very easy class, but youll need to show up. Professor Johnson is very kind and sweet, and she goes out of her way to make sure every student feels included. Youll need to keep on top of your assignments and participate in class in order to receive a good grade. I highly recommend taking her course.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDEwNDg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-12-05 21:44:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"The most amazing professor Ive ever had!!! She brings candy everyday, very funny, understanding, always available, and shell let the class choose what format you want the final to be in. Probably only had 2 quizzes but they didnt count. Id definitely take her class again if I could. Lots of D2L discussions but its just reflection questions. :)","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwODg1MDgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

The class consisted short lectures, often with activities involved, and then giving a short response on D2L after class. No tests, we maybe had 1 quiz and I don't even think it counted. We never had to go to the book, so don't get it bc you can borrow someones if you need it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzAzNzQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-11-08 15:37:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's the sweetest. She's a great teacher. I just don't like the idea of a Freshman Seminar. Besides that, the assignments are easy.

She always has candy for everyone.

She is the sweetest, most caring professor that I have ever met. She's super funny and is great at promoting a stable enviroment for growth. You use the textbook for reading, but I managed w/o. Come to class, enjoy everyone's company, and most importantly learn how to adjust to college. You won't regret taking her. perfect.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjYyNTkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Caring--Would take again","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
