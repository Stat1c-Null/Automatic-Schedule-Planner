She does like group projects and has a very clear grading criteria. You miss to turn in an assignment on time and you lose points. She is caring, however, and would give an opportunity to make-up 1 assignment but that is all. No extra credit is offered and book is used to some extent.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODUwOTAy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Clear grading criteria--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KSU1200","date_posted":"2017-10-28 17:23:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Echols helps you understand why things matter.

This class is really terrible, she doesn't give any clear communication, she will always try to one up you on everything you have done, she is a bit of a racist so be very carful about what you say.

She isn't very clear on how she grades things, so when you get your paper back, 50% of it is highlighted. Group projects are on pointless topics that get graded harshly.

She uses real life experiences to connect with the course criteria. She likes to work remotely which has been very convenient for those who have a full time job and are full time students. Very understanding and has a cute laugh. I wish she taught more classes at KSU!!

Everything is done online. It's easy, but you won't learn anything and she grades terribly on your group project; she's inconsistent, late-causing trouble completing your next part, and not very understanding. Good point-she does give days off for group work.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTE5Njcw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1101","date_posted":"2015-01-14 17:02:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was late to class, would send 5 emails correcting herself, didn't pay attention to campus policy (she scheduled class during finals week), wouldn't respond to emails, gave ridiculous assignments that had nothing to do with class, and graded many students harshly based on opinion expressed.
