He didn't warm to me much until i completed my essay and got a 95 then he suddenly was a lot kinder. Overall he is okay and offers extra credit.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTkzNjEw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
