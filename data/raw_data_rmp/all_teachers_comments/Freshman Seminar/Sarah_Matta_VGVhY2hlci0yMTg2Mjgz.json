KSU1101 is a very unnecessary class, and instead of just accepting that professor Matta loads you up with unnecessary busy work. Class is a waste of time, and definitely needs to be redesigned. Also she's an VERY tough grader","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzE3MzQx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

The assignments are very easy, but you just have to keep up with them & deadlines. The tests are all open notes. Be sure to right done many things that she says during the powerpoints because she will ask some questions based from what she says. And pay attention to guest speakers.
