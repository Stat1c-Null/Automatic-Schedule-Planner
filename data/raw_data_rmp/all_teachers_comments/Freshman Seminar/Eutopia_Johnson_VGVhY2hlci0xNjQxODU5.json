She became my freshman seminar professor in the middle of the semester after my original professor left and it was a very smooth transition. She gave us many group projects and they helped us learn more about the campus. Overall, I think she is a great professor who is very understanding and is willing to help.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njc4MzYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2016-12-19 11:07:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor J is amazing! The class is  mandatory, but she  makes it enjoyable and leaves a lasting impression on her students. You really get something out of it in the end, and she's someone you can always count on, even after the class. 1 major essay, 1 group community issue project, and 1 individual community (10 service hours required) project","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTY0MDUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2016-12-01 18:20:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you like group projects, community work, and talking about your feelings then this is the class for you. Really easy. A few essays but she grades so easily that anyone can pass. Tons and tons of assignments but they're all easy.

There is an individual community service project that requires 10 hours of community service that needs to be done throughout the semester. There's also a big community project that you do in a group that begins in the middle of the semester.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Mjc2MzAx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Respected--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2015-11-05 11:45:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Johnson takes this class very seriously and makes it fairly difficult considering it is a required course. Only 2 test but must complete 10 hours of community service and a huge group project. There are a few presentations also. I like her as a person, but her grading is sometimes unclear. Not sure if I would take again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQ5NjMx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2015-05-21 14:18:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"I hated the class content and the group project was a nightmare, but Mrs. Johnson was a great teacher. Even if your team does bad on the group project, she notices who works for it and who's slacking off. I got an A in the class despite my dislike of the reading materiel, and she likes discussion.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODgyNTgw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2013-04-04 00:56:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Well, its all about an individual project and a group project.

The material, other than the personality tests, isn't interesting, but she is a fun person.

It is very boring and all we do is go over powerpoints. It kind of seems like a waste of time. She makes mistakes a lot and tries to make it sound like that crap actually applies to our life.

It reminds me of a high school class. Students usually talk half the class about pointless things. Easy A, just do the work assigned. A midterm and final.
