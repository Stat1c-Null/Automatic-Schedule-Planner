She is friendly, approachable, and always willing to help out. Though attendance isn't mandatory, is it VERY helpful. The class isn't a breeze but it isn't impossible.

Her tests can be very tricky too; read the material!!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDM1MzE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1111","date_posted":"2011-12-08 23:34:49 +0000 UTC","comment":".","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NDM0NjY2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SEM1101","date_posted":"2011-11-17 23:19:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mrs. Law is awesome.

She was my favorite professor. This class is easy if you read the articles and the common reader and attend class regularly. Her class is not a joke, you have projects and tests and campus events.

She is always upbeat, so I really enjoyed her class. You do have to read alot of articles in this class, but she goes over all of them. There are a couple of group projects and one big project at the end that you have to do by yourself.

You've got a paper, a speech, group presentations, 3 tests, 5 event summaries. It's not a joke simply because it's a freshman seminar.
