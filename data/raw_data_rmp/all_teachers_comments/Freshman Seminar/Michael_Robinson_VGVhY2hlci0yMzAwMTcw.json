Michael 100% cares about how you're doing in all of your classes, how you're doing in general, and will take time to talk to you if you ever need anything. He allows 2 absences before you drop a letter grade with each additional absence; 6 or more absences and you fail.

He is always more than happy to help you in class and is the best adviser. He will also listen to your problems. But anyway his class is really easy to understand and is tons of fun, I recommend taking him for your KSU 1101 class.

He gives you three excused absences. If the class is struggling he will give everyone extra credit. He works with you and is so much fun. Makes you laugh and tries his best to make sure you get a good grade. 10/10 would take again.
