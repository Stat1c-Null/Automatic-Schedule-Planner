She starts the class off with a motivational speech which lasts through most of class, which helps time fly by. She's a nice woman, but she is very strict about attendance. If you come in late or not at all a lot, then you will NOT pass. Its an easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjY5NTM4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

However, you won't get a good grade if you skip which is dumb. Don't recommend unless you go to class the whole semester.

She isnt a teacher just a motivational speaker who never shuts up. She acts like she is better than everyone and is not easy to work with.

That being said, from what I hear she is much better than other seminar teachers. She is very nice and caring so if you can get past the annoying workload outside of class, in-class is a very nice time to nap or study before other classes","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Nzk4NDEy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
