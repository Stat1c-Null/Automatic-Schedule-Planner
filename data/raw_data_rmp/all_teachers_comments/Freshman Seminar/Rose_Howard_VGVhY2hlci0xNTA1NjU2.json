Do not need to buy book but she does in class discussions sometimes where she refers to book. Puts power points online.  Mostly interesting class activities and discussions. 4 test. optional final. and a short paper. IF YOU COME TO CLASS AND ACTUALLY LISTEN AND PARTICIPATE YOU WILL PASS.

The material is really interesting. She will have everyone's name memorized by the end of the first week. She does a lot of group activities which is nice to break up the power points.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNDIxMjA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3000","date_posted":"2013-04-18 10:08:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely LOVE Rose Howard. She really wants to get to know you and cares for you and wants you to succeed. I would take her over again. She makes assignments fairly easy and explains them in great detail. She puts the PPT's online and goes over them in class. 1 group project (easy), a midterm and final, and a few simple assignments. Pretty easy!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTU3ODUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS3600","date_posted":"2013-04-03 09:46:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Howard was a great teacher! The class was so easy that I failed my midterm pretty badly and still passed the class with a B. She is very fair and she explains everything very well.

Prof. Howard tries really hard to make it interesting.  You have to stay on top of the assignments because there is a lot of homework.  There is also a group presentation at the end of the course, but it is more for practice than anything.  I would recommend taking Prof. Howard.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODY5Nzgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
