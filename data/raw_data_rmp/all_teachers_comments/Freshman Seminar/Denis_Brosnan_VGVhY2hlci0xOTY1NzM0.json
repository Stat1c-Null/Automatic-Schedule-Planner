Multiple short papers, easy to write on but his grading is picky about certain things. Also have a research paper that is awful. His whole focus is on Corporate Social Responsibility.

You have to know specific things from the reading in the book. I don't like him as a teacher, it's boring and awkward. Don't take his class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MjQ2MjU1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
