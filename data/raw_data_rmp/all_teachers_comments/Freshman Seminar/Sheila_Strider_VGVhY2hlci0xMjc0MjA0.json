Show up, speak up and get your A. Some busy work that is graded on completion, not quality. Likes to be challenged, but be respectful. Community service/group project can be on anything.

You have a five page paper due that is graded on effort, just like everything else in the class. Don't need the book, she uses powerpoints in class and can be used on the tests.

She wants to hear opinions though, so be prepared to speak up.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Nzk5NDc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU2290","date_posted":"2010-11-05 17:49:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very kind hearted person, however very unorganized. Also very thoughtful. She spends 70% of the class just talking about what is on her mind and even what she thinks of while she is speaking. Test are most likely straight from the book.
