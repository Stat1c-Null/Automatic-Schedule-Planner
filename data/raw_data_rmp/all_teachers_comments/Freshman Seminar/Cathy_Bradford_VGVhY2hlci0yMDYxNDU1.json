No tests or long essays, just reflections and quizzes and one project. The deadlines are so flexible and she gives way more than the time needed for things.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDg1MTMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-11-08 11:48:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Bradford was amazing. She was fun to talk to and is very helpful and clear when she answers questions. Her class was very active and she is available for anything you might need be it something for school or just someone to talk to. Her class is so easy and easily passable if you participate.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU3ODYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-11-08 11:47:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"If there is one professor that you need to have while here at KSU, you must take Prof Bradford. She is the most caring, sweetest, and kind-hearted professor you will ever meet. The class itself is pretty much a breeze and I guarantee that you will leave the class with an A and you will have so much fun along the way. No day is ever the same.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU3ODUw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU12000","date_posted":"2015-11-09 22:17:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Bradford is so sweet! She truly cares about each and ever one of her students and makes sure to know them by name. There are a lot of activities in her class so be prepared to stand up and sit down. There is not a mean bone in her body. Try to talk to her after class and you will get to see what I mean. Honestly, one of my favorite teachers.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1Mzc2NTg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
