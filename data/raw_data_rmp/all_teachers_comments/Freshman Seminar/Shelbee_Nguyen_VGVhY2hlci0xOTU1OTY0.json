She's a horrible professor. The ENTIRE SEMESTER was presentations, only presentations, and she barely taught. I can't remember a single lecture she actually did. And her grading is horrific, she's unclear and inconsistent. If she likes you, you pass!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzQ0MDE1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-11-30 19:07:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Loved her.

She tries to establish a chill atmosphere in her classroom where everyone is comfortable with each other. She doesn't really put up with laziness, but that should be expected on the college level. Her assignments and classes are interesting and engaging and she makes it very clear what to do to get a good grade.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Nzc0MjYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

I got an A, but I didnt think I would just did good on final. Shes kind of rude sometimes, but most of the time shes cool. I tried to talk to her about fixing my group project grades and she didnt seem to care. You dont do much but there is so little grades they count a lot.
