Any person who doesn't mind earning a grade and wants a professor who will make sure that they are successful throughout college should definitely take this course. You will come out a better person and understand yourself more after this class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NjYwMTY0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures--Inspirational","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2015-11-11 17:37:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"If there was on phrase to describe Professor Williams, it would definitely be \"old-school.\" If you do something wrong, he will ridicule you for it. In my opinion, the class is not difficult, but does contain a noteworthy amount of homework and papers each week. I would say don't take this course if you're not looking to be called out.

He treats freshman seminar like an actual class, which is good or bad depending on who you are.  If you plan on taking some harder classes this semester, DO NOT take this class as he will assign lots of busywork.
