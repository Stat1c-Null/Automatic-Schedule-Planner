Must come to class but class is enjoyable and you get to interact and have class discussions so it isn't boring. Would choose Harvill again if I could! Cannot say enough about how nice he is.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTE4MTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

He actually really helps you and things you learn in class are great for knowledge in college. Easy assignments, easy grader, gives extra credit. Its really hard not to get an A in this course unless you dont show up. Recommend him to anyone!! :)","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1OTM2MTQ1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
