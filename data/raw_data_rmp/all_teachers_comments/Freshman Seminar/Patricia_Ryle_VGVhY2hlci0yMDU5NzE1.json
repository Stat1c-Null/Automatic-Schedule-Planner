Because it is required for freshmen at the university and you have to pay for it. With that being said since you have to take this course take it with her. I heard that a lot of the other classes were not as fun and a lot hard. The only hard assignment is a group project.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODk5NzIw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1200","date_posted":"2015-12-16 05:07:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Let me start by saying that this is a seminar class. It is a class that the university requires you to take, but doesn't put the effort in to actually make it interesting. With that being said, Ms. Ryle did the best she could. She isn't tough whatsoever and is very understanding. Content is clear & test are easy. Easy A if you participate.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NzE5NzE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1200","date_posted":"2015-12-14 13:15:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Guys, it is an easy A and it is a required class.  She is not strict AT ALL and most the time she does not teach.  She is extremely nice and very very easy.  Take her class get over the boringness of it and get you A.

The thing we do most in class is listen to random \"guest speakers\" like her friend or family members. When she did teach us, she'd just parrot whatever the book said. Her tests and things were easy, but I learned nothing and the class was a waste of time.
