However this was turned into a class where you do a bunch of random busy work and type a bunch of papers. In addition that, making an a was almost impossible unlike every other seminar class.

She just gives a lot of work, and she has zero toleration for you not turning in the work. It is a lot more than other classes, but it's not the end of the world if you have to take her class. If you just do your work and study for the tests, you'll pass.

Kekes class is like taking your highest level English class. you write a total of 12 papers (2-3) pages in the semester. take 3 tests and 3 quizzes and then a lot of hw assignments. do not take keke any other professor is just fine but this one apparently forgot its a seminar.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDQ3OTA2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":14,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
