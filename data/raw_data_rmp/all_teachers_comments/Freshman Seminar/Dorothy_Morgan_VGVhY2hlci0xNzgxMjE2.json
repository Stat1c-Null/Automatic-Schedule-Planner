Honestly, I had more work in this class than in English 1102 and math combined.  She expects you to get a lot done without clear guidelines.  Take KSU 1101.  I've heard they do barely anything.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTU0Mjg5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2013-04-04 10:43:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is nice but kind of disorganized. She changes due dates constantly, so it can get confusing. This class has a lot of work and its pretty pointless. We kinda used the book but barely.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDg1NTAw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2012-12-13 03:14:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dorothy is a super sweet teacher. She was helpful, and made herself available always. There was a lot of work for this class. There is a couple papers, 10 + hours of community service and a group project. Easy class, but a lot of work. Never used book.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDUwNzcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
