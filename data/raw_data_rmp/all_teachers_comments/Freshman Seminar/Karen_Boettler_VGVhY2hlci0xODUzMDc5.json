She was, by far, the easiest professor I had my freshman year. She teaches like a high school teacher, always reminding you for quizzes and tests. But still, you should keep up with her syllabus! I feel as though she truly cared about me and my future. Overall, she was a good teacher.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDg4OTcx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1121","date_posted":"2016-11-09 17:09:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is such a nice person and would recommend taking her class to anyone. Ksu class is not as easy as people think. We did a paper, midterm, group project, and an indv project! You will have to do some work in this class but not difficult.

She gives a decent amount of homework, but if you follow the rubric exactly, you will do fine. She had only 2 tests but they weren't difficult if you studied and filled out her study guide. You cannot miss more than 3 classes.

She is sarcastic and goofy and so nice. If you have any issues just take the time to meet with her; she will go above and beyond to help you.

She is so unorganized I never have any idea what is going in in class.. Also, she never seems to care about anything and she has a bad attitude. I'm not doing well in what should be an easy class because Professor Boettler is so unclear. If you want to do well in KSU 1200 then stay far away!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzM2ODk3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":4,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
