He actually cares about his students and their well-being. He will never give you something that you can not handle... but attendance is mandatory unless it's a emergency make sure to contact him via text or email to not receive points taken off. Other than that be prepared for class participation and essays.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNDg2Mjk2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Amazing lectures--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
