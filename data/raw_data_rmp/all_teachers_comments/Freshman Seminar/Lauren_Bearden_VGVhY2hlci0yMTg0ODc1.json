You don't even have to show up for class, just make sure to complete online assignments. She will help your grade out if you show her that you care about her class. Aside from teaching, she is very easy to talk to and understanding of personal issues.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDE0MTY5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Would take again","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2018-01-07 17:02:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is an amazing professor! She is very caring and as long as you do the work you get an easy A. The class was one I was not looking forward too but she made it worthwhile.

She has been my favorite professor so far. Easy class and she's beyond caring and understanding. I turned in a few things late and she didn't dock! You have a few projects at the same time but they're relatively easy. Quizzes are easy and she gave all the answers to the midterm! She also randomly gives extra credit.

If you are a freshman coming out of high school this is the class for you. Prof Bearden was by far my favorite prof this year, &amp; I enjoyed her class even more! She understands young people so well &amp; always made me feel like I had a voice. Midterm is cheddar, the occasional R&amp;R, a few group projects, and you got yourself an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODQ3MDY1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-10-26 22:42:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Bearden as my freshman seminar instructor and she was absolutely amazing. I feel like it's because she's so young and fresh out of college that she understands how much energy school sucks out of you. She is a lenient grader and definitely cares for her student's well being. Yes, she assigns readings but they're well worth the time","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NzkxNTk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-10-20 11:13:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very great professor and easy to get along with.
