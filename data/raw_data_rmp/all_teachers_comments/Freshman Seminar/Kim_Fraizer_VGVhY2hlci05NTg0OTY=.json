Follow the syllabus, attend class, and follow instructions.  Take notes! Very social class.  I made lots of friends by taking this class.

However, I had more busy work in this class than ALL my other classes combined. This is not college level material. this should not be a required course. Again, it is basic knowledge. I did LOVE Dr. Frazier! she rocks!

If you like friendly teachers she is great! If you turn in assignments you get full credit! I took her during the summer, so we did less work, and wasn't very time consuming.

She gives a lot of pointless assignments and tries very hard to be &quot;cool&quot;. I felt like I didn't learn anything about this class and her tests were oddly specific. She tells people she is teaching them to grow up and be independent, and then she baby's you though the class.
