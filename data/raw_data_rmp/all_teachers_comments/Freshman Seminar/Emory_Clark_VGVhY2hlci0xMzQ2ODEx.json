The material itself isn't very interesting, but I doubt many freshman seminar classes you could take would be. You will only be responsible for a very small portion of the reading. Very kind professor and definitely recommended.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MzQ3NDQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
