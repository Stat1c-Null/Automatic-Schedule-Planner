Instead of lectures, the class features discussions, games, and also projects that help transition students from the high school mindset to the college mindset. We had to do 3 campus events, which was fun to do with classmates in the seminar.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzEwMTY4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
