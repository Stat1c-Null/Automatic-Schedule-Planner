She goes over what will be on exams and even posts in in D2L. She grades them quickly too. One class presentation project which was super easy. Attendance is not mandatory but she gives out participation grades at times for being there.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTQxMzUw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2013-01-05 00:01:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was by far the worst teacher I have ever had to deal with. She has absolutely no idea what she is talking about while trying to present her lessons. She changed the syllabus and grading scale at least six times throughout the semester. She takes off points on essays and tests for grammar that is not incorrect. She is NOT qualified to teach.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjEwOTcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2012-12-17 09:57:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Worst teacher I have ever had.

She brags about how she is so highly educated but I doubt it's true. She does not teach. She reads. I could have taught the class better.

She does not know how to properly teach, she pauses and \"um's\" all the time. She teaches from pre made PPTs and reads straight from the book. She does not know how to grade quizzes; hers are out of 5 then grades them out of 4 so online you can never get a 5 out of 5.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODI0NTI0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2012-11-12 22:37:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. This class is pointless regardless, so it should be an easy. She makes it WAY more difficult than it should be. Never makes any sense, or knows what she's talking about. She'll tell you one answer is correct in her \"study guides\" then mark it wrong on the test. It's like you have to babysit her. Horrible teacher.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODIxNDE2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSUKSU","date_posted":"2012-11-08 16:05:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take her. I got her cause the class i signed up for was TBA. She repeats things constantly, and stutters a lot. She isn't a harsh grader on the essays, but her tests contain a lot of statistics, so you have to literally know the book word for word.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODAxMDE0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2012-11-08 12:00:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had.
