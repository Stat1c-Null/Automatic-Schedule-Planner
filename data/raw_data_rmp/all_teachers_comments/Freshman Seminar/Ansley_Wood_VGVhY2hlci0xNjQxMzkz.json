She seems to know her material, and makes it somewhat interesting. It's pretty much a discussion class. However, she gets very moody if you don't do what she asks of you. Her tests are kind of hard, and very broad. We go over specific articles, and she tests us over all of them. Just read and you'll be alright.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjUyMTE2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1111","date_posted":"2011-11-10 00:00:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"OK professor. This class in my opinion is just boring and pointless. She does a lot of in class discussions. Tests are based on specific chapters from the online textbook required for this class and articles online. She is moody and kicked out my class for not reading an article. Overall easy A if you study the material and complete assignments.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjA0NDk0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
