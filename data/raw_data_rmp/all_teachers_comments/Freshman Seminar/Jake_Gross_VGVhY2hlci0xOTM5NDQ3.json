KSU 1111 with Dr. Gross has a very laid back environment. There's one test (midterm) and he gives you the option at a final exam or a final paper. If you want an A do the DRJs he assigns those are easy 100s. Overall Dr. Gross is an amazing instructor! TAKE HIM!

He is serious when needs to be and fun when it is a right time. Easy going everything is literally in the syllabus if not he will make up for the confusion. Definitely a professor I can see myself keeping contact with!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzA2OTg5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"KSU1111","date_posted":"2015-03-27 12:51:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"VERY helpful and friendly. Made you feel involved. Class discussions MATTER so show up to class! A lot of group projectsassignments. Guest speakers every other week. The studyguides are vague so make sure to stay for the optional review session!

He is willing to work with students, and he is a very likable person. As one of my first college courses, I became fully comfortable in his class. After all, he is the Director of Orientation and Transition Programs. He likes doing group discussions and assignments. Reading is recommended. Interesting class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTA1NjQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1111","date_posted":"2014-12-12 12:02:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Gross was the best professor I had this semester. It isn't just a sit down, listen to him talk class, but a interactive class where we just talked about things most class period. He's super helpful with letting people know about all the campus events going on, and cares about student success.
