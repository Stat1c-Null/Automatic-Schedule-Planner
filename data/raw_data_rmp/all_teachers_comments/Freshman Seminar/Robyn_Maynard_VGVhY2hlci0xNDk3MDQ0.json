Would've received a higher grade in participation (even though I always talked) if I wasn't very sick and missed two weeks (with note from school to stay out of class).

She is their to help you and will review everything before a test. She opens your eyes to the many different things going on in our world.

When we go over test, she always reviews. If you fail this class something is wrong. All you have to do is put in a little effort and you'll get an A.
