You will need the textbook for sure and you WILL need to read it because she is a fan of pop quizzes.

You do get work, but definitely not overwhelming at all. Its more of a breeze. The assignments can be started and finished the day of.  If you connect with her, she'll connect with you and you'll enjoy this class. She's hilarious af and she loves when people talk. If anything just ask a bs question. You wont regret it!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzA5OTAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

There are many graded assignments however, most can be completed the day of. Very easy grader and explains everything she wants in the assignments in the syllabus.
