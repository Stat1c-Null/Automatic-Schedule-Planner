She is a project based professor, she encourages you get active on the campus by assigning two papers about an event on campus. 2 tests (one online and one in the classroom), final was a course reflection. Read the powerpoints and come to class and its an easy A.

It was an excellent class and even when I was hopping mad from my previous class I was always able to come into her classroom and relax. It was a simple class you just had to pay attention and show up.
