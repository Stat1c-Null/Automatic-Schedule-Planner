His class is very easy but boring and kinda annoying. It is sorta like he wants to be your friend and not a professor. His assignments are very straight forward and I made a perfect score on all of them but they are pointless assignments.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODEzOTY1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"KSU1101","date_posted":"2017-06-13 11:27:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Spratling was a great professor! I really enjoyed being in his class and he made me want to come everyday. He engages all of his students and you can tell he really cares about his class.  If you come to class and participate, you should do well on his tests. The assignments were not difficult, and I found that they were very helpful!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NDQ4Njg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
