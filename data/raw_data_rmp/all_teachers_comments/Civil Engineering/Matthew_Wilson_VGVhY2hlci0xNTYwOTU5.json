No exams or quizzes, only assignments. The material can get confusing, but he posts videos that can help out.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjY3Nzk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SURV3222","date_posted":"2020-11-05 19:22:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Literally has done nothing all semester. Has not taught a single piece of material, simply posts random tests and assignments from as far back as the 90s. When confronting him, he is very knowledgeable but acts as if everyone is already a pro at the material. If you take him online, you will learn absolutely nothing!!! HWK is never graded. No help!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzc0Nzgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"SURV2221","date_posted":"2019-04-27 13:24:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had Wilson for SURV 2221 and 2221L and enjoyed it. He allows that class to use notes on the tests and clearly explains the tests before you take it. His lectures are clear and concise and it is obvious that he knows what he is talking about. He is normally pretty relaxed concerning deadlines and just wants you to know the material.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjkyNTc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"SURV2200","date_posted":"2015-04-07 13:19:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Funny proffesor, grades easy, two tests were taken with him out of the class, and he didn't care if you copied. Easiest A you can get. all tests open notes, and labs are easy he step by step shows you what to do.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTU1MTE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
