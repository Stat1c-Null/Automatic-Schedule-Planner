His personal formula sheets he gives out on test day is the answer key minus the numbers, so don't worry.

For this stat class he had really concise power point slides he used for lecture and posted on d2l. Grading wasn't very lenient and each of the 3 tests is 25% of your grade, but if you understand the hw you shouldn't have a too much trouble.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTc3MDYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--TEST HEAVY--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ENGR3305","date_posted":"2016-12-17 12:35:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Yang  is an excellent professor and is very passionate with his teaching.

There are some lectures that do get confusing and he will make you understand no matter how long it takes so I admire him for that. 2 tests and a final.

His lectures were clear cut and he was always straight to the point in what he wanted you to know. He set up the labs to where they didn't take too long, but you understood the concepts.
