He will bend over backwards to help you understand the material if he sees you trying to get it. I once went to his office because I was lost in class. He wouldn't let me leave until he was sure I understood the concepts. Would take him again if I could.

If you think it's hard, it should be as nothing that is worth it is easy. The man cares for the student but he will not baby you. Will make sure you want to be a structural engineer and will challenge you to work harder. He is a must to have as a professor. 1998 SPSU Grad","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NTk0MTQx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CE4103","date_posted":"2017-03-17 17:37:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the best professors I've ever met.

He does give out a lot of homework, but it is very helpful in learning and understanding and learning the material.  If you put the effort in you will do well in the class.  O would often meet with groups of students on Saturdays to go over any questions you may have.  A must take for any structural engineer.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MDc3MDgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CE4103","date_posted":"2015-06-08 11:52:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"very unorganized and confusing, gives homework every week and you have to turn in all the assignments at once the day of the first test, so you won't know if you did the homework correct until after the first exam.

He expects you to know EVERYTHING, he doesn't do any examples and if he does he prints it out and goes through it very fast. This is a steel class not algebra, his first exam was after the last day to withdraw so if you fail the first exam you cannot withdraw from the class. PLZ AVOID!
