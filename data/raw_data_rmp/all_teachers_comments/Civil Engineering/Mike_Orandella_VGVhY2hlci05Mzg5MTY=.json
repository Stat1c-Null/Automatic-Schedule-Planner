You have to figure that out and without the use of the textbook because he does not go by it. We had to do study groups on weekends and after class to get an idea of what the material was about. When we got stuck he would mock us. He does not have the patience to teach. Do not take him.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0Mzg1Mjgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CET3316","date_posted":"2010-07-27 21:02:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great Professor and very good at helping you with problems you might have so speak up.  A solid foundation in Statics is needed for his course too.  If you can do the homework then you can do the tests.  I learned a lot from this class!

Tests are entirely homework material, sometimes he puts a question relating to a theory that he barely mentions in class. Also prepare for homework that takes hours to complete!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTY5Mzg0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CET3316","date_posted":"2009-09-16 21:45:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome Prof.  Very hard and demanding...but you are going to be an engineer..duh.
