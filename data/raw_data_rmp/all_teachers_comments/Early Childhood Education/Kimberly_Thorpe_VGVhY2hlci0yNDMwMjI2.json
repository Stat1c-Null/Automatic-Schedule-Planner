Don't count on getting any emails back. She tells you not to communicate with other students? She gave our entire class the same feedback for a lesson plan, copied and pasted. Lots of busy work. She gives you all the answers for each exam.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjA2NDQz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"INED3305","date_posted":"2019-05-02 19:26:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"TAKE DR. THORPE. she is so passionate about what we are learning which makes it fun. She is such a sweet lady and doesn't care about due dates as long as you turn it in.

She cares so deeply about the material she is teaching and it definitely rubs off on her students. She is very lenient about attendance and assignments. She does not care when you turn things in just as long as you get it done. It has been amazing having a teacher as chill as her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjgwNjUx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Inspirational--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2019-03-21 17:08:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Thorpe is my favorite professor this semester.

This class is hard, but that is not her fault. As long as you come to class and pay attention, then you will do well. She is caring and gives GREAT advice since she has so much experience with special education. I would take her again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNzg5MjEw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
