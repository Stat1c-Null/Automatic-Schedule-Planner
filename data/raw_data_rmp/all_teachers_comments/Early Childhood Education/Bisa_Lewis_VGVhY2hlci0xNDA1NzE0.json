Her assingments were clear as were her deadlines and instructions however she really had her favorites and she seemed to only care about how much money her jobs pay her. She's friendly in class but not in person.

If you miss 2 days, your grade is dropped an entire letter.  If you miss 4 days, you will fail the class. She teaches her own curriculum that she wrote the textbook for. I emailed her a question & her reply was we'll discuss in class.  Problem was it was a hybrid class so we wouldn't meet for almost 2 weeks.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTYyMTkw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3313","date_posted":"2010-05-02 09:04:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her class is her pushing her own curriculum.  Did not learn much about the other curriculum's in the field.  She is unapproachable and is not helpful with questions, and can be quite rude when asked one. ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY or she will drop you a letter grade!  She rarely responds to emails. I strongly recommend not taking her class, AVOID.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTAxNjYy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3302","date_posted":"2010-04-28 00:27:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"I agree that this professor is extremely rude and abrasive.  She does not respond to e-mails in a timely manner (I had to wait 2 weeks for a response), however her time is valuable and she will not answer ANY questions without an appointment.  Her teaching does nothing to prepare you for lesson planning.  A waste of money and time.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDczNzEz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3350","date_posted":"2010-04-06 09:44:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Horrible, horrible teacher.
