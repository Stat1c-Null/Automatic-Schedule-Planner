The class consists of mostly lectures (extremely boring) and occasional group work. Some outside work and a decent size group project at the end.

Ms. Whitney however doesn't want any conflict. She cuts off the discussion when it turns to race.  She is so forgetful. The student needs to track their points very carefully because the teacher forgets what assignments count for a grade. I was extremely confused as what was due and when it was due!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzI0NTgw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2008-11-26 17:13:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a super sweet lady, but very scatter brained. She also give out a ton of big assignments. At the beginning of the semester she said she wasn't going to give us a bunch of big assignments because she knows how it is and that most of us have jobs and don't have time. Well that did not happen. It was like every week she assigned something else!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MDY2NjYx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE2205","date_posted":"2007-08-09 12:22:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very Enthusiastic!
