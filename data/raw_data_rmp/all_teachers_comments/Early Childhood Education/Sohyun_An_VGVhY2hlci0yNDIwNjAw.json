She makes it fun by introducing kids books (some we can't use in a classroom) of different perspectives of well-known historical events. She is so energetic and passionate! She makes social studies fun and exciting even for those that hate the subject. Her content is inspiring and eye-opening too.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NDE5MjIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Inspirational--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE7707","date_posted":"2023-07-17 23:17:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. An is AMAZING!
