I felt like a lot of the work was found online already so coming to class was pointless. If you have the option of taking this class online, just do it because all she did was go over the powerpoint we already had. The learning content and assignments were heavy but that's just how the course is.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NDMwOTQz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Lecture heavy--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2022-05-16 14:08:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class in person with professor Thompson rather than online. I'm so glad I did because we did a lot of the readings and some assignments in class. She is very passionate and knowledgeable about inclusive education. She loves when students ask questions. If you follow the rubrics, you'll be set. Her lectures are great!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzQ4MzY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2019-05-03 21:27:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved Professor Thompson's class. She is passionate and knowledgeable. She brings her experiences to lectures, which I thought was helpful. She is currently in grad school, so some days it was easy to tell she had not spent much time preparing the day's content. Even then, she did a great job teaching. Only negative- there was a lot of busywork.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzYzMzU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2019-04-22 17:39:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a nice lady but full of busy work. Also, very unprofessional, she will answer her phone/ respond to texts in class. She complains about her schooling and says thats why she cant get our grades back at a reasonable time. She is a hard grader but won't look over anything before you submit it. Very lazy in terms of preparing for class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjQzNDg4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2019-03-27 19:53:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Thompson is very caring and is understandable if you get sick or something comes up. However, since she is a new professor she does tend to be a stickler for the rules. So, make sure to bring in doctor's notes, etc. There are a lot of assignments in the class. She does lecture from power points so keep that in mind if you're a notetaker.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDg4OTIw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2018-04-25 15:16:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"She talks to you as not only a student, but a person.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODkxODIz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2018-03-12 11:48:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Although she is new to the course, she is very knowledgeable about the content!

From what I heard, this teacher was better than the other INED 3306 teacher at the time (2017). You have to put effort into your work and she does not give out extra time if you miss a module. A lot of guided notes, which suck.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDAxNTgz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
