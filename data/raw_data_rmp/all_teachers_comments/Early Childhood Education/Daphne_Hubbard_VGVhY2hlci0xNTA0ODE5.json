I took her during the summer and it was a very laid back experience. I was able to soak in the material at my own pace, and going to class was a blast, and that is saying something for a summer semester at 8am.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTcyMTMw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDRD3300","date_posted":"2013-04-30 07:37:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was a hybrid class, meeting only one day a week.

You don't learn how to teach content reading in her class; instead, you make a lesson plan you'll never use in your classroom. The class is, unfortunately, a waste of time and energy. Oh, get used to graphic organizers - every. single. day.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjM4ODU4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2011-04-16 10:11:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you have a chance to take her you should!

She did not know much about the expectations of the course or anything about chalk and wire but she learned quickly.. Every other week she would allow us to observe instead of come to class. We didn't use the textbook hardly at all, and due dates and assignments were clearly outlined.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3ODU5NzYx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
