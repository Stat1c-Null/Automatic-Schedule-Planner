Kind and approachable, she doesnt give many big assignments and they arent difficult. She does alot of classroom group work and discussion. The lessons and outside reading assignment didnt take very long and she is fair/slightly lax on her grading. I would absolutely take her again if I could.

Knows a lot and is helpful but not always clear. Attendance is mandatory, do not be late either, she keeps track even if you don't notice. Didn't use the book at all. She posts a lot of readings online. Flexible with due dates if she knows you are trying. Take her if you can, she's a great resource.
