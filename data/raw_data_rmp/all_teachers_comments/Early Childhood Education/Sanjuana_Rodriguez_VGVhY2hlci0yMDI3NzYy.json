Just takes a while to respond to emails, is pretty unorganized, and is decently strict with due dates. There is A LOT of reading and quizzes on that material the beginning of every class. The exams are easy, there is just a lot of busy work and writing essays.

There are quizzes every week and the class does have a lot of work. You will be doing a lot of work with children and be writing tons of essays. She will let you fix certain things to help your grade. Any questions I had, she always answered them. If you are overwhelmed, she will move dates around to help.

She is one of the worst professors Ive ever had. She isnt organized at all. Shes rude and inconsiderate. Takes forever to answer emails. If you can take another teacher, take another teacher.

The best education professor at KSU. I wish I could take her for every class. She really teaches you and everything we do you will do later on as a teacher. I recommend hard copies of the textbooks bc it is easier to take to elem schools and do assignments with students.

She is very sweet to the student's and is always open to talk to you about the class. We have reflections due every week and literature circles for the first half of the semester.
