There were no directions for any of the assignments. It was a waste to email him because he simply wouldn't respond. He also wouldn't give students his office #.

You have to push him to be clear about assignments. Forgot to open a drop-box every week the first 5 weeks and ended up pushing the assignment back a week every time. He has a lot of excuses for this and about half of them lay blame on the students somehow. That said, he's an easy grader and very willing to push due dates back.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTQ0MDA0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDUC2130","date_posted":"2018-06-19 14:42:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was a summer class and he was not at all clear on the guidelines. It took him 5 days for us to get the syllabus and even then it did not align with D2L.
