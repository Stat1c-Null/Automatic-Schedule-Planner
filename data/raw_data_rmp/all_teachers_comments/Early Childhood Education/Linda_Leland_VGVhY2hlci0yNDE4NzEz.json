Excruciatingly so. You'd think by the directions she gives you, it would be an easy A. No, she is a very harsh grader for no apparent reason. With a 3.94 GPA in my second to last semester, my lowest grades were from her. :) I do not recommend this class, it's basically useless.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDE2Mjgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECE4475","date_posted":"2020-11-17 19:00:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Most boring class ever. Pretty easy, but could honestly be a day course instead of a whole semester-long class. Sometimes she can take off points for bogus things. Simple assignments but feels like a waste of time.

However, her lecture style is very slow and hard to follow, thus they are very boring.
