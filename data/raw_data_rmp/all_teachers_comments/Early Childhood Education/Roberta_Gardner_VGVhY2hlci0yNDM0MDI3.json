I had to redo a huge assignment and she worked with me to fix it and kept my grade up because she saw my effort. Her class equips you with resources, books, and authors to bring into your future class. I will truly miss her, I definitely recommend her.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1Mjc1MzIx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2021-01-27 17:07:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is so darn sweet and so passionate.

She is clear on what she expects of her students, and was always willing to work with you individually to clear up any confusion. Her assignments were time consuming but not difficult at all.

We had three lesson plans throughout the semester and instead of pacing each lesson, she made us do silly work to &quot;prep&quot; for the lesson plans and made them all due at once. She is kind of rude and doesn't care that you are in overdrive taking this class with three others AND student teaching.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTgyMTE3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2020-03-11 20:23:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"THE WORST AND RUDEST PROFESSOR","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTY3MzU4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
