She gives assignments without ANY explanation. She never emails you back. She does not grade a single assignment all semester so you have no idea how good or bad you are doing. Save yourself the stress and annoyance-don't take her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDk3NTI1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
