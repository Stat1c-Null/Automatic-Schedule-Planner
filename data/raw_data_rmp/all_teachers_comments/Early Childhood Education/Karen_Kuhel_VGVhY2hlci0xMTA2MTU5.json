Gives you her cell number but hardly answers. I felt like I didn't learn much the 2nd part of the semester and she would cancel all of our assignments so we had no grades except the 2 take home exams which are hard bc you have to be VERY specific.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMTc5NDQ5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"INED4483","date_posted":"2018-11-04 13:43:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"It seemed like she did not know what was going on the entire semester. When students ask questions, she never gives a direct answer which was frustrating. She was not in charge of the assignments in the syllabus so that led to a lot of confusion. She did not deliver content clearly at all. It was very confusing &amp; stressful communicating with her.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNjU1Mjc1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"INED4482","date_posted":"2018-01-11 21:36:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Kuhel is an awesome professor! She is super funny and has such a passion for linguistics! She is super understanding and is helpful when students are in need.
