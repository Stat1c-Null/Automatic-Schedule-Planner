She rarely has class. She has such a negative attitude and you will learn absolutely nothing. She is by far the worse teacher in the Early Childhood Education Dept.  She a true waste of money.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTQ3NTkw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3313","date_posted":"2009-06-04 16:56:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She does not make the class interesting nor does she come to class prepared.

Every one in the class disliked her, because we did busy work and did not learn anything. She is often late, but expects you to always be on time. People who worked on their projects for days got the same A that the people who threw it together at the last min. got.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NjQxOTQ2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2008-03-25 20:34:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"She doesn't do anything but change the syllabus a million times. She spends most of the class changing dates, trying to get someone to pull up a power point or telling the class how this sememster is just different. I didn't learn anything from her class. She is unorganized and we had take home tests because she didn't teach us anything.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0MjAwNzkz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
