Very informative. I took this as an online course during the summer and the work was pretty easy, but still challenging. He is definitely an easy going guy.

She has never taught a college course before and it's painfully obvious. He approves of your project, she says no. He gives you a due date and THREE days before the due date, she changes it. I used to love Dr. Bell, but now I will never sign up for his class again.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjE4OTM4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3350","date_posted":"2014-12-07 21:30:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing professor, would for sure take again. Many, many assignments but interesting & easy. Doesn't grade quickly, but when he does he's an easy grader. Very lenient as to when assignments need to be turned in. No tests, but tons of projects and a few papers. Really knows his information and has great stories to tell to make class interesting.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzOTc5MjA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
