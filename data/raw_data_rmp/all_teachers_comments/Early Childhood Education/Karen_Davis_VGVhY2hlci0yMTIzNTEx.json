I took this as an evening class, and I always looked forward to going. She is willing to help you any way she can. Take good notes, pay attention, and you will do fine. The class may seem overwhelming at first but stay strong! You will love her!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTQ0OTM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2016-04-28 01:57:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Davis is not only a wonderful professor but a wonderful person. She was so supportive of us and only wanted us to succeed. She is always there for you no matter what question you may have. I think she did a wonderful job for this being her first semester, and I can only see her getting better and better the longer she is at KSU. TAKE. HER.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NDAxMzQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2016-04-04 00:49:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Davis was new to KSU this year and you could kind of tell. Nothing was very organized, but she made it the best she could. She is flexible with due dates and makes class fun. She goes over the assignments with you instead of saying, \"just look in the syllabus!\". I would take her again!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjI0NjYy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
