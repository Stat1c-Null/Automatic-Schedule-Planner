There are 4 Assignments in her class &amp; her assignments were repetitive. She grades strictly by her rubric so make sure u follow her rubrics for all her assignments. I felt like I have learned nothing but assessments &amp; learning targets in her class.

She grades straight from the rubric, but the rubric normally has more requirements than what the assignment description is. You get points for coming to class. Normally lets out early. Can be a tough grader and cares about participation.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzQ5NDc2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3305","date_posted":"2019-03-16 23:23:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Kim is a solid choice!

She grades right from the rubrics. Follow them and you should be fine. 20 hrs field experience in Pre-K. Need to plan/teach a lesson and create a parent project for students.
