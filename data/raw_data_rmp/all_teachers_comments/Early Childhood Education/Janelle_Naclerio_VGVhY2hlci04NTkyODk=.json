She remembered me, encouraged me, & offered advice. She is great in my eyes. If you do the work you'll earn an A. I got a B, but I turned work in late because of personal issues. I kept her informed & she worked with me. She does care about her students. And she's a totally hot MILF.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NzU3MTUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3302","date_posted":"2009-12-19 20:09:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"The class was super easy to me, but things werent clear.
