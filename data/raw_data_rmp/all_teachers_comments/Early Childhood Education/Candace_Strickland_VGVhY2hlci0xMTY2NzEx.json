She does tell lots of stories but this was helpful for me. She had lots of real life teaching experiences to share! Her grading is fair and the tests are not difficult if u listen to the lectures and read the book. It takes a little work for an A, but isn't college about that anyhow?I really enjoy this teacher and wish that she taught more classes at KSU. She is not the most technically savvy though (and admits this too)!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTAyMjQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2010-05-19 17:34:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ended up being a good class, exempt the final if you get an A. Which I did, but overall fairly easy grader.  She is VERY strict, doesn't mess around with excuses!  She will definitely make you work..this was a hard class.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjM1OTE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2010-05-19 15:38:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really enjoyed this class! It is a lot of work, but if you follow the outlines she gives you for the assignments you should be fine. She has a lot of energy, which was great because the class was never boring!

But when you go to take the final, she has a prejudice way of choosing who can exempt, will accuse you of being lazy and not taking notes and then will drop you a full letter grade for failing. I would not recommend her for this class!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTkxNjQy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2010-05-03 15:39:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is a great class if you are majoring in professor strickland's grandchildren or the Mexican culture.

I strongly advise against not taking her if you can!! She is useless. She doesn't like her students and she doesn't want to help you at all. This class is full of useless assignments.

Some people think that she comes across as mean or not caring. She really pushes her students to do their absolute best, to do top quality work, turn in assignments timely and generally be mature future teachers. I would take that kind of teacher any day over one that doesn't care.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTMyMzE1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2010-03-26 13:22:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"She does come across as kind of scattered, has kind of a negative outlook on teaching and school systems, and yes, talks all class about her grand kids.

She spends half her time telling you about her grandkids than actually teaching material and when she does get to notes she breezes right through them. I learn nothing from her and have to rely completely on the book.
