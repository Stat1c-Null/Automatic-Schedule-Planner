I learned a lot in her class and was provided with a lot of information that I will use when teaching. The class is a lot of work, but you will be glad you did it when the semester is over.

I had a rough time in there, did my best, and got a B when I feel that I deserved an A. Slaved away on this huge field experience binder all semester only to get tons of points docked for having only a few minor things missing.
