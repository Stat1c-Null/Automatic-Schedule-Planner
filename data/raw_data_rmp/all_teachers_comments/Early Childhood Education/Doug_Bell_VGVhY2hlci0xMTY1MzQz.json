Pros:  it was exceptionally fascinating to watch him narrate observations, developmental stages, and tell stories with his animated personality.

She has never taught a college course before and it's painfully obvious. He approves of your project, she says no. He gives you a due date and THREE days before the due date, she changes it. I used to love Dr. Bell, but now I will never sign up for his class again.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjE4OTQz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3313","date_posted":"2016-04-01 13:44:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Be careful when signing up for his class, you may end up with his ridiculous wife.
