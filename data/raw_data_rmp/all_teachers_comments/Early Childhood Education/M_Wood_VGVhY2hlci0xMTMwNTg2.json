I did not learn as much as I would have liked to learn in her class. She was always confused on the assignments she assigned us. The biggest problem was that she did not use VISTA and would send loads of emails to the whole class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTUzNTAz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2010-04-28 12:07:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"This professor it TERRIBLE! she does not grade fairly. She does not use vista and sends you TONS of emails over and over again. she is very unorganized. I learned virtually nothing in her class. she spends the whole class period going over assignments.  her only way of &quot;teaching&quot; is reading chapters in the book and take TONS of detailed notes.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MDc1OTMw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3330","date_posted":"2008-05-23 14:43:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Once she graded  eveything, she handed back the folder and told us that we did not need to keep anything. She never lectured, and when she did, they were useless.Every day she assigned a new project. She is extremly nitpicky and does not grade evenly across the board.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0NTE1NTIw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3330","date_posted":"2008-05-01 23:45:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was way too stressful! The majority of the class was her badly explaining her complicated asign. When she did lecture she went way too fast and just skimmed the subj. The only thing I learned from this cls., I learned from my field exp. and from the bk. Her tchng., just confused me. She is a VERY harsh grader! She is patronizing and rude","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0Mzg2NDg4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
