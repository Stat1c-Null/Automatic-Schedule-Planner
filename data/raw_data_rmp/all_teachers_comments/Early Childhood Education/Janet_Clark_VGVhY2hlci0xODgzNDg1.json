She has a clear &amp; precise syllabus that was followed throughout the whole semester. Textbook is a requirement in order to reference the reading materials given. Overall, the assignments were easy to complete and it was an easy A! I would definitely recommend taking online!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzc4Nzk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2019-04-26 01:34:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"I managed to swing by this semester without the textbook though it would've been so much easier with it. a module (1-5 assignments) is due each Sunday. a final paper and volunteer hours required. not a hard class, she isn't a hard grader, she's very clear on what she wants, take her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNjgyMjIy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2018-12-17 06:50:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class online and I often didnt do my assignments until the night they were due. I still got an A in the class, but theres a lot of work involved. Buying the textbook is a requirement because you have to use citations. No quizzes or tests. Only discussion posts, journal assignments, and projects. The final exam was a paper.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMDYxMzg4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK--Tough Grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC2120","date_posted":"2016-07-28 02:00:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took as an online summer class.

When I did I was basically guaranteed an A on the assignment. I took this class as part of my summer courses. That means 2 modules a week. She is great with communication.
