Everyone is always confused. Really only graded on 4 assignments, that are very time consuming and hard. She is unorganized, her syllabus, D2l, and rubrics all say different things. No clear guidelines/directions.

Very lecture heavy and usually the class is left very confused on what is being asked of us, during class. Easy class though. Work load was manageble just didn't feel useful.

She is so sweet and really wants to see her students achieve. Her class is not stressful at all. There are four assignments &amp; a few discussion posts, very easy to achieve. Assignments are spaced out and you have time to actually learn &amp; process information. Take her!!! You will not regret it.

Got an A , but I barely passed to her standards. You need a 92+ to pass. There are 4 assignments, but each is major to your grade. There is a rubric for each assignment, but she takes points off even if you meet the rubric. Attend class and participate- it helps your grade! Overall, she does not make virtual learning any better.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTc4MTEy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

No one in our class received a perfect grade in anything. The way she speaks to you is very rude and condescending. you have to get a 92 to get an A in the class which is very hard to do with only having 4 assignments graded. However, she did offer extra credit at the end which i am thankful for. Would not recommend.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTAyNzMw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECE3305","date_posted":"2020-12-15 19:29:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I was really excited about taking her course, however was very disappointed. There are 4 assignments total and she waited until the last 2 weeks for us to complete the last 2. Honestly way too strict of a grader and her feedback rarely makes sense.

Sometimes it was boring at 8 am, but she did her best to get us engaged. She is very caring and listens to the needs of her students. The assignments are LONG, but the are necessary.
