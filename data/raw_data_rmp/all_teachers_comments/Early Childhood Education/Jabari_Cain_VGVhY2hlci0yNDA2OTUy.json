The directions were explained so perfectly and he left amazing feedback. He also allows for resubmits and, to be honest, I didn't turn in most of my work until the end of the semester and still made a 98%. I 100% recommend taking a class with him if you can!

Don't bother taking in-person. Few assignments but they can take a while.

No need to take it in person. Lots of tedious directions to follow to complete assignments. You're creating digital \"artifacts\" every week. Lots of voice recording so make sure you have a quiet place. Very strict details and steps to follow, and it can take up a lot of time. Just the nature of the course.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTQyMjg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lots of homework--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ITEC3100","date_posted":"2022-07-26 18:38:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"This course online is pretty cookie-cutter with every other section. It's all just an online module that was created by one professor where everyone does the same thing. I took it during the summer so it is a lot of work that is pretty condensed, but this isn't the professor's fault, it's just the nature of the course. Lots of tedious details.
