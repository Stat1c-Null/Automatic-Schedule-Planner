We are not music teachers and we were learning how to teach music class, not how to integrate songs into our instruction. There is very little room for creativity; you MUST write your lessons to be done EXACTLY as they were done in class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTU3NzAy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
