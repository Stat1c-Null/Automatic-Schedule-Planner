You can learn a lot from her. Attendance is mandatory but I never missed a class because it was not painful to go to. She is very helpful and clear with what she wants. As long as you listen in class and engage then you will be fine!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODcyMjM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUC3302","date_posted":"2012-10-30 13:06:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"I loved this professor! She definitely had high expectations, but made everything clear and gave detailed rubrics, along with lots of time for questions during class. I definitely took a lot away from her class, so you might have to work, but you will LEARN. Come to class, do the assignments, ask questions, and you'll be fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzUzNjE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDUCA3320","date_posted":"2011-08-16 21:48:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was new so it was a littlemunclearr what her expectations were.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4OTI0MDI4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"EDU3302","date_posted":"2011-04-26 11:46:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"The teacher was very critical and all the grading was subjective, rubrics were not followed! The way she acted toward her students made it seem like she did not want them to do well no matter how hard they tried! Even the extra credit was subjective, even doing it did not guarantee you any points.
