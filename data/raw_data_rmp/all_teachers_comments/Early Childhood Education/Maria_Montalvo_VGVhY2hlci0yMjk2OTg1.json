Be prepared to ask lots of questions for clarity, and be prepared to ask again when the answer isn't always helpful the first time. Points for being somewhat flexible with deadlines.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzQ0NDYy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECE4483","date_posted":"2019-05-03 21:23:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Montalvo is passionate and knowledgeable about ESOL. She shared her personal experiences with us as an ESOL student. I think everything she brings to the course is helpful. She will appreciate if you participate in class discussions. Her questions are a little too broad to answer, but try your best! Overall I enjoyed her class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzYzMzE1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED4483","date_posted":"2019-05-02 19:28:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Class is very boring, but normally lets out early. She can be an easy grader on some assignments. She has a lot of group work and makes a lot of our assignments in class so if you have questions you can ask or work with groups. She can seem strict but overall I would take her again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzQ5NjI5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED4483","date_posted":"2018-11-27 10:12:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"I enjoyed this class and learned a lot. Our class started out struggling with her, but at the mid-semester evaluation, she changed how things were going based on our feedback and it turned into one of my favorite classes. I learned so much valuable information on teaching ELL students.

Class is boring but good time to get other work done. 1 group project, 2 take home exams (1 is the final), weekly discussion &amp; module assignment. She's a super slow grader, but usually grades pretty easy. She teaches us like we're grad students. There's a ton of reading. Easy A- if you don't try very hard you'll probably make a B.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4ODU2OTMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
