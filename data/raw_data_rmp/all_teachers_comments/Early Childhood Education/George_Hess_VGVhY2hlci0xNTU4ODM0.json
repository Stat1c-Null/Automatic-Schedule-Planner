He is willing to compromise on assignments but you will learn absolutely nothing during this course. Attendance is mandatory, and that is basically the only reason people ever attend class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMDY4ODk4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3330","date_posted":"2012-02-06 11:56:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you enjoy learning, don't take this class. I have never been one to complain about teachers or professors, but this is a special exception. except for 1 lesson plan, you don't do anything until the last few weeks, then he suddenly gives you 4 big assignments at once. what's worse is he doesn't grade them. he def. takes advantage of his tenure.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5ODAzNDE2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2011-06-22 21:09:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"He gave us no assignments everyone thought it was going to be great and an easy A.... then he decided to give the entire class B's for no reason.

He is extremely unorganized and class was useless, I learned nothing. He's scatterbrained and boring and to top it all off, he didn't grade any of our 3 assignments (that he gave the last 2 weeks of class) and simply gave the entire class all B's. I'm an A student and everyone in this class is furious.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NjEwMDk3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3330","date_posted":"2011-05-06 22:45:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr.Hess is a very knowledgeable person with lots of experience in the field of education.
