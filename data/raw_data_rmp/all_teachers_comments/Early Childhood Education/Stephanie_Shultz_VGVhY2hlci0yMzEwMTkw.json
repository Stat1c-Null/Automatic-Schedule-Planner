She is very educated and knows what she is teaching from experience. The course is very do-able if you just apply yourself and read the chapters before the quizzes. Be sure to use APA citation! You will love her! She counts off for being late though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODg4MTM0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
