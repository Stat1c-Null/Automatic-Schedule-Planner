This class was really engaging and I enjoyed it. He is a current 3rd grade teacher in Cobb County so I love hearing about his students and knowing that he has experienced what he's teaching & doesn't just teach from a book or 10 yrs ago.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjAzNjE1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
