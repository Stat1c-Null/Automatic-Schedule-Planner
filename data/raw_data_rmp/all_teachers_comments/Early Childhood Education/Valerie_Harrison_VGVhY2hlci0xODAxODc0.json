She is rude, inconsistent, and not clear about expectations.  Useless busy work. PPT every class. For such an important class, I have learned hardly anything. I am an A student, so it is not like I am a slacker. She single handedly ruins my day every Mon and Wed. AVOID AT ALL COST.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDA2MTY3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
