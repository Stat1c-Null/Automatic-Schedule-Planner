She can get frustrated if you do not understand an assignment; however, if you read the syllabus and listen to her instructions you will know what to do.  Most of the frustration came from young students who preferred talking in class to actually listening.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDIyNTMw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3350","date_posted":"2012-11-08 12:07:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Usually a nice lady, but can sometimes get a little cranky if you have a lot of questions. She can be very unclear and vague about what she wants from assignments and the rubrics are just as vague/simple. Pretty opinionated but an easy A.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzk5MDA3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
