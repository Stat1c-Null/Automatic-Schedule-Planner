She is a literacy coach in Cobb County so she is actually on the front lines every day.  She really knows her stuff !  She is SUPER nice and EVERYTHING that you do in class is relative to what you will be doing as a teacher.  Most teachers stick to textbooks, which are typically useless.  This is all about real world stuff !!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMTY1NjU5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
