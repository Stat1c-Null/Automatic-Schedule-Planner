Her expectations for each assignment are explained both in her syllabus and during class. You cannot make it up though, you have to do the work and you need to get on it from the beginning. Her coursework is difficult and it is group work, so be sure to stay in contact about any issues. She'll help you.

However, her class is very interactive and fun, and you will learn a ton about how to teach Science. Her assignments are pretty minimal, and they are all relevant to the subject. No textbooks!:) She posts articles on Vista.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNjYyOTU2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
