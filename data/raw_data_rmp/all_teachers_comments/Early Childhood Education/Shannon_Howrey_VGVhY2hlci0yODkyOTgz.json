She cares so much about her students and helps you way more than the other online instructors. She actually teaches, doesn't just make you figure things out yourself.

She sticks to her syllabus, and that's why some students don't like her. If you just follow directions, turn things in on time, come to class, and do your best she will go to all lengths to help you out.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDc4MzU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3320","date_posted":"2023-04-27 16:53:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"She an easy grader. And gives very clear instructions. I learned a lot about reading and writing P-2 in this class and will miss it!

She does not accept any type of late work, unless your CT vouches for you. You will get a zero!  She showed favoritism towards certain groups and would brag on their work in front of us. She did make lectures fun with groupwork and I did learn a lot, but I wouldn't recommend.

If you show up to class and do your work (most of it is group work), then you'll be fine. She grades super easily. There are 2 tests, and she gives you extra credit if you score first place on her Kahoots. She is not flexible with due dates unless your CT emails her saying that it was impossible to get your work done.
