She is so quick to respond to emails to clarify anything you may not understand and is available to meet one on one as well! The class itself was SO much busy work, I feel like I learned a lot but was rushing to meet deadlines rather than really apply my learning.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjYxNzQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"INED3304","date_posted":"2021-02-22 00:28:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Never been so overwhelmed with a class. She seems to not understand how much students have on their plate and thinks that this is our only class. I felt like I was completing work just to get a grade and I was not actually learning anything at all. This class is very important for future teachers and I wish I would've taken it with someone else.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Mzc5MDI3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
