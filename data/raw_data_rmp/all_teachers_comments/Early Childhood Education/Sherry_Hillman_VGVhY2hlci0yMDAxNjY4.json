There were basically no homework assignments and as long as you showed up to class, participated, and completed the classwork, you will receive an A. She is very accessible outside of class and gives great advice whenever you need it! She would go above and beyond!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjg0OTE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3350","date_posted":"2015-04-16 12:38:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was amazing to take! As a future teacher, I loved taking this course with Mrs. Hillman. She has the best personality as well as knows how to teach about children. She is flexible with projects and not really any tests or homework! Would most defiantly take her again!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NjA4NjM4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
