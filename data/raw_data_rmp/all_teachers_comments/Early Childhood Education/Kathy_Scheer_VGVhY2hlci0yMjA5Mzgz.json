Assumes the worst and is not very accommodating. Forgets any agreements you've made. Really tough grader with mean feedback rather than constructive. Ignores emails when it's obvious she is online grading things. Busy work every week for a grade. Avoid her class!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDM0MjM4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
