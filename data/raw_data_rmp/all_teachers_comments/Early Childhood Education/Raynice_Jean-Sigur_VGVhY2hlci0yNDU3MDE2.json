She is an amazing lecturer. She makes her class extremely fun! I would take her every semester if I could. Class was a little work heavy but in the end she adjusted several of the due dates to ensure everyone had the opportunity to be successful.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMjY5NDky","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
