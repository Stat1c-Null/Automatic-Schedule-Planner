The class is a TON of work, but relevant and necessary.  She is very friendly and willing to help you in any way that she can IF you ask for it.  It is a tough class but certainly passable if you work hard.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjI0NjUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ECE3330","date_posted":"2012-10-31 09:47:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT take her for online class.

If you can take her in a hybrid class, DO IT.  After the required reading is done and the discussion questions are posted, the class really gets down to business of teaching reading.

I was overwhelmed the first few weeks of class, but if you stick with it, she is very understandable and all assignments have a soft due date.
