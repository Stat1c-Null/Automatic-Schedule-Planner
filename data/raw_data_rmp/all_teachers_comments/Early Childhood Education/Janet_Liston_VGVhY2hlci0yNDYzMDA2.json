It was math for grades 3-5 and instead of teaching us methods of how to teach students, she challenged us. We would be doing math work every week and with things that not even 5th graders would understand. She is an easy grader BUT can get snippy esp about phones.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzQ5NTYw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ECE4408","date_posted":"2019-02-12 23:12:57 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not a great professor. I think outside of class and school overall she would be nice. When asked questions, she would seem very offended. Like we were questioning her authority. She never really knew what was going on. She is new to KSU but as a professor, I felt like she should have known what was going on anyways. I would definitely NOT take her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxMzU1MzIy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
