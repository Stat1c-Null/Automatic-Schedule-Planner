Be detailed on on them. There are two group work discussions which are easy which is the same like the regular discussions. There are two papers: review paper and final exam paper which is easy. Got a 100 in the class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTczNDU5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STS2150","date_posted":"2016-04-27 12:08:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took her for an online class. Had great discussions and was a fun class BUT She graded 8 out of 9 discussions that were done throughout the semester THREE WEEKS BEFORE CLASS WAS OVER (With no feedback!!).      So since I did not receive the majority of my gaded till now.  Somehow I am failing and I don't know why BECAUSE THERE IS NO FEEDBACK!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MzkyMDc3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STS2105","date_posted":"2015-12-19 00:55:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Long and boring class.

Active participation in the weekly discussions is essential to passing the course. Near perfect or perfect attendance may exempt you from writing the final paper. No book is needed in the class. Group project requires a 10 min speech for each person.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NzY2MTQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STS2105","date_posted":"2015-12-08 15:29:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really easy class. She is super nice and tells you exactly what she wants. You must be active in the weekly discussions which are pretty easy, nothing really long that you have to write. Only other things are 2 papers which are about 3 pages and a short powerpoint presentation for your final.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTkxMjQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STS2105SPACE","date_posted":"2015-11-04 15:06:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pierce really cares about the subject we discussed (outer space) and has relevant experience in the field. As long as you show up to class, do your discussion posts and are able to follow instructions for your assignments you should be fine. For online it should be the same, follow the instructions do your work (which isn't heavy).","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQyMjc3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
