Way too much work for a 2 credit hour class. You will have to read the most boring book ever written about the wright brothers and that about all the \"history of flight\" you'll get. They should change the name of this course to the origins of flight because we never really got past the wrights.

Expect weekly reading quizzes, 3 papers, 1 major research paper, a debate, and two tests. He does return quizzes and tests, and lets you edit papers after he goes through them for regrading. Overall however don't expect to know your grade until you see it on your transcript.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMzc5ODcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STS2400","date_posted":"2013-01-10 18:58:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Difficult for a 2000 level course. Sometimes likes to make it feel like his class is the most important class you will ever take based on assignment difficulty. Hated that I asked him on four occasions for my grades on papers that I had submitted, and I never received them at all. Lacks a sense of urgency when it comes to grades. Good luck.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjQzMTMx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STS2400","date_posted":"2012-12-17 17:41:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is a lot of work for two hours. The good news is if you work hard in the beginning the end will be easy. Three easy style papers, one major research paper, ten quizzes, three major tests and the final.  Quizzes would have been hard but he gives you the questions before the test. All the tests are the same test.

He knows just about everything.  His main objective is for the student to grasp the material and therefore will be lenient to grading (extra credits).
