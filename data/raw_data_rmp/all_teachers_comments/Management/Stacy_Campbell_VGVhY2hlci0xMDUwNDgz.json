If I could take Dr. Campbell for each of my classes I would. Highly recommend her and The Coles Scholars Program if you get the chosen to be apart of it.

Classes provide an opportunity to learn via real world assignments. A good grade comes from hard work, a great grade comes from going the extra mile.

She wants you to learn &amp; challenge yourself everyday. Come to class prepared to participate in discussion. You need to earn your A by adding value to projects and assignments. She is also a great human outside of the classroom.

She is extremely up-to-date with the business world and curates her class so that what you learn is more than just reciting a text. She expects a lot out of you because your employer is going to expect a lot out of you and she also cares a ton about her students. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNDY0OTU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Accessible outside class--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSCH4010","date_posted":"2014-12-22 18:17:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Campbell is a reasonable professor.  She is to the point when it comes to feedback, sometimes even a little gruff, but the feedback is constructive and has helped me to better understand and complete assignments, and to think about what is being asked.

She gave us the topic to the group project about 3 weeks before it was due and didn't grade based upon what she told us to do. Very confusing. There are 2 tests that account for 50 percent of your grade, one of them on campus and the first one online. Good luck.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNzIxOTI2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4170","date_posted":"2013-03-12 11:54:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"My biggest complaint how unorganized she is.

The only info that I found interesting was the things the professor didn't perform herself (guest speakers, videos, etc.). I often had no idea what the professor expected for assignments, and the syllabus changed so much that it felt unorganized. I made an A, but I don't recommend her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3OTc2MzQ4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGMT3140","date_posted":"2009-06-16 10:48:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"This was a class on leadership.  Workload was not heavy and she was easy to work with.  She changed the syllabus a few times during the semester, which made it hard to keep up w/ your grade. Take her online course.
