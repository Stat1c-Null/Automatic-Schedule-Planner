His test are easy but he really doesn't teach from the book or the material needed for the test. His syllabus is very vague that way he can twist around what is said to effect you in the way necessary he feels it should. I am junior with 96 credit hours at KSU and has been the worst.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODE4Njcz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2021-05-04 01:30:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hes a new professor, but he does need to fix his grading criteria. He doesnt clarify what he expects so the projects can be tough. His tests are easy though.

VERY unclear, arbitrary grading criteria, which caused a lot of problems for my class. Sometimes didn't respond to emails. Lectures weren't helpful but attendance mattered a lot. Seemed to be winging it (and failing). Could not even work D2L properly. 1/5 avoid if possible","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjQ1MzIw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2021-01-14 00:13:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Would avoid taking this professor at all cost! the test that he gave was from a bank out of what should have been the online hw (we didn't have access to any practices/hws). He gave group projects, but never gave feedback just told you the group's work sucked. Never responded to emails, belittled you in class SO RUDE and unprofessional.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0Mjc0NDky","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
