Got a 99.5 for the class. 2 discussion posts every week. 1 paper a month, normally 2 pages. A midterm & a final. Both tests are 9 questions, with your opinion on ethical dilemmas.

It seems to be alot of work, but it's not really.  If you do the work (4 papers) and participate, you should make an A.  Very nice Professor.
