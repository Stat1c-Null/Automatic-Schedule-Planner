I enjoyed the class more than I expected.   He is a very practical teacher and uses a lot of games and videos in class to emphasize points he makes in lecture.   Gives plenty of extra credit opportunities.  He says read the book, but that book was absolutely the worst text I have ever had.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyMzg2NzQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
