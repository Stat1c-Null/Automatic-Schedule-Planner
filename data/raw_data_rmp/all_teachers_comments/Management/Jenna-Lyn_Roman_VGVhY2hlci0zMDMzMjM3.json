She met once a week, her class was boring by just reading off a powerpoint, but I did enjoy her class purely for the friends I made as well as her biggest grade was the group project. If you do well on that you should be fine. Plus I missed a lot of days & traded off with my groupmates & still made an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNTIwMzg0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4001","date_posted":"2025-01-07 14:27:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the worst professors I've ever taken but it may be because she is new and that she is a graduate student but I wouldn't take her again. She reads directly from PowerPoint slides in class, and it's a joke and not engaging at all. She has 3 exams, lockdown+webcam that are okay if you read the textbook and a group project with a presentation.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDk5MjUy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4001","date_posted":"2024-12-09 03:33:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"She reads off the slides and its mostly information from the textbook. There is a group project that isn't hard if your group is involved. There are 3 exams , 2 in person and 1 online (the final) lockdown w webcam. The majority of your grade is the project. She isn't terribly bad to take but if there's another professor take them.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTY2ODQ3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4001","date_posted":"2024-10-17 14:18:25 +0000 UTC","comment":"Do not take this professor! She reads direct from slides that are copied from the textbook its very boring. Tests are very hard and taken from textbooks, she will not help you study or prep for exams and merely tells you to read the book. If an entire class does bad on a test its the professors fault for not teaching it! Group project is mandatory","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODIzMDQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4001","date_posted":"2024-10-03 02:35:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE. Reads directly from PPT's, which are wordy and taken directly from the textbook. She tries to simulate discussion in class but is rude and shuts down any discussion if someone disagrees with what she says. Very disorganized and doesn't have due dates available at start of semester. 1 big group proj, 3 exams, & some extra credit quizzes","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NzgzMzI1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
