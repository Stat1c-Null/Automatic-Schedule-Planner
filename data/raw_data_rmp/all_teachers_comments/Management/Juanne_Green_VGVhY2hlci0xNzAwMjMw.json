She's extremely enthusiastic as she teaches so the material is pretty interesting.  There's a lot of busy work but in the end it really helps because her exams are pretty hard. If I wasn't taking so many other hard classes i could have made an A in the class with the extra credit.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5OTkwMjI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
