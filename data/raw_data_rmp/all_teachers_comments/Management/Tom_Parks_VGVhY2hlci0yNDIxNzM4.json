Only downfalls i'd say is hes a bit slow on responding to messages and the group project is a heavy percentage, half of your grade. But all materials needed are given to succeed. Quizzes and exams super easy. Def take him for 4199.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzA3OTEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2019-12-09 20:43:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor!

I've taken two courses with him now and the grading still makes absolutely no sense, and you will not get grades back in a timely manner so even though it usually turns out fine your lost on your grade until the end of the semester. Inputs final grades like 5 minutes before they're due. Just grade normal dude.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMTIyMzk0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2019-07-12 02:09:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"It's an online class. He gives a lot of flexibility to learn and is very understanding of personal situations. The discussions posts have a lot of flexibility and the quizzes are very straightforward. His quizzes and tests are open book.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyMDkyNTAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGMT4190","date_posted":"2019-04-11 19:42:24 +0000 UTC","comment":"He really is a great professor! Though an online class, he gives great feedback and makes it very clear what is expected of you. He gave us &quot;grace&quot; points for a few assignments this semester, just because.
