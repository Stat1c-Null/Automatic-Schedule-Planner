He goes above and beyond for his students in unimaginable ways and makes things very understandable. His tests are online (Lockdown Browser), and if you can't attend in person class, he offers a lecture video that you can watch. He is a caring professor that wants nothing but for his students to succeed.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODg4OTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Amazing lectures --Lots of homework","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT7040","date_posted":"2022-12-12 22:25:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Classes are mostly lectures which can be on the dry side, but he tries to engage the class.

Lectures are pretty boring but everything you need to know for tests is in his study guides. Homework assignments are few and far between. Group project isn't too bad but groups are large.

There is a smartbook required but that's the only busy work. There were 3 exams but his study guides are great. There are a couple medium projects but he grade off effort so if you really try youll do well. One group project but same as the small projects.
