She takes FOREVER to grade assignments. It's finals week and I haven't received half my grades. Her tests are difficult because they're poorly written and gives you very little time.

But homeworkdiscussion topics for the online course were strangely unrelated to test questions. 60% of the grade comes from 4 tests which are in overly complex written essay style format.
