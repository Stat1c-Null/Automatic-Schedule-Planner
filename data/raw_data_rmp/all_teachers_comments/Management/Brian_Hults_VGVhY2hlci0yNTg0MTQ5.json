However, he doesn't just read the slides verbatim. He includes his own real-world experience with the concepts to help make it more understandable. If you have to take MGT 4001, register with professor Hults with confidence. Awesome guy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MTc4MjA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2020-07-08 15:32:41 +0000 UTC","comment":"Please take him !

Class was not mandatory, but he did take attendance periodically. You have a group project throughout the semester with multiple assignments. 3 Tests. Hults is pretty cool, but one thing is he does not hold students accountable for their faults so be careful with the group project. Overall, would take.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMzY5MzYz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2020-05-10 09:09:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Hults was an excellent professor to have and truly helped me realize what kind of individual I want to be in my career.

His entire goal is to make sure the students are successful but also makes the class amazingly easy. He takes random attendance checks but only about 5 times in the semester.

He's had several high ranking jobs at Fortune 500 companies. This allows him to provide extremely interesting anecdotes about the course material. On top of that, he is an extremely fair grader and wants his students to do well. Tests are based on the textbook. Definitely recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTUzMTMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2020-04-28 21:58:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Grading structure is fairly straight forward.

There are &quot;pop quizzes&quot;, but he usually lets you know ahead of time and they are easy. The tests are open book, so not too hard. The semester-long project is easy as long as everyone in your team is reasonably reliable. Not too much work, and easy grades. Connect was not a requirement.
