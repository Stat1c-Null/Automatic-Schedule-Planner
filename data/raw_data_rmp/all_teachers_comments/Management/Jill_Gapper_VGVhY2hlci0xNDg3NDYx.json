Most work is done online, except for group projects. As long as you do the homework modules and your group project you'll be fine. All test are done online, including final.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxOTg1NDMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2013-04-24 15:50:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher. Has entertaining class discussion where anyone can speak their mind about the subject. 2100 points total. 750 group assignments, 800 easy points from online modules (as long as you do them), the rest from individual work that is not that hard just requires some time management. I would take her again if given the opportunity.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNTk2MzIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2011-03-14 13:34:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"She was extremely hard, and way too demanding with our workload.  The midterm and final consisted of about 5 essays each and short answers AND a multiple choice section that all had to be submitted online.  My group was worthless that she assigned me.  I do NOT recommend Gapper for what is supposed to be an easy class: MGT 3100.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4Mjc0NzMw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
