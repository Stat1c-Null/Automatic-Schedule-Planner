He is very rude, boring and doesn't know what he's even talking about. You have a quiz every week over 2 chapters which are 25 questions and are hard. He doesn't explain anything or listen to other peoples opinions; he's always right and you're always wrong. Don't take him. There were only 2 A's out of the 35 students.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTg1Mjcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGNT6008","date_posted":"2012-12-07 09:26:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"AVOID TAKING IF POSSIBLE, ACTS LIKE HE CARES BUT TRULY DOES NOT.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTgwMjY3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGNT3105","date_posted":"2011-10-27 06:48:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great guy. He cares about his students, and makes sure they understand the material, If they ask him for help. Make sure you read the book! That is a major portion of the grade. you will have several quiz over what you read.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTE1MjQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
