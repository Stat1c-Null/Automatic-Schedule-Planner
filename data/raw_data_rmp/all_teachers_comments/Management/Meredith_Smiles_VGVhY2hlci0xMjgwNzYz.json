She cancelled so many classes and those that she taught were sometimes 15 minutes long. The online modules are a headache.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MDAzMzU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2010-11-03 13:28:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"OMG! Take her...She is an AMAZING professor, wants you to enjoy class, you will learn ALOT from her. Test are very straight forward, right out of the book and powerpoints, Attendance is not Mandatory but she will  take it once in a while and it counts towards your participation grade. Very nice lady. I wish she taught more classes.

I took it during summer 2009, she couldn't get webct to work so she had to drop about 100 points out of our total point spread.  She doesn't teach anything, just reads from the power point slides.  I learned nothing yet earned an 'A'.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MjUwOTg4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2009-05-03 22:19:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"Greatest teacher ever! Cancelled class for 2 weeks for no reason. Showed us the test and answers to review. All she does is read the powerpoints. 2 tests, 2 case studies and a group project. Let us even grade our own tests. Replaces the final with best test grade. If she was teaching more classes i would totally take her again! Best teacher at KSU!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NzU1Njc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
