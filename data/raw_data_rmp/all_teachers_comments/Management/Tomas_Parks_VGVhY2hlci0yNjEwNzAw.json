Quizzes every week (found online) and two tests (answers online too). There is a group project but it is not hard and he gives you a lot of time to get it done. I would take him again in a heartbeat.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzM5Mjk3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2020-07-20 16:50:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was a great online professor.
