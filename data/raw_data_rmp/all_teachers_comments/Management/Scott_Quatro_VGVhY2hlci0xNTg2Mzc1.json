That represents 20% of your grade. Again, this class was very relevant and you should learn as much as you can. I wish he would provide feedback on the discussion questions. As easy as it is, there is an opportunity to learn more here.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjQ5MDUx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Would take again","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ILEC8810","date_posted":"2013-12-12 22:13:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He was so understanding but he made you read! but if you dont you wont make good posts, typically 2-4 posts each week! interesting topic and ties everything together, take him for foundations of leadership or any other seigel institute class if you can! midterm, multiple choice, final definitions and essays!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTMzNDAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3140","date_posted":"2011-08-31 14:56:32 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took Leading and Teaming in Business online.
