Prof Xu is pretty straight forward, there are 6 chapter discussions and quizzes, 3 attempts for each quiz, 2 group projects and a final essay as your final exam. TIP: On discussions be very thorough on answers, and find group members asap!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMDAzNzg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2012-11-05 13:36:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class online and it was horribly difficult to follow. She does not use any of the tools on Vista, is late updating grades, give three paragraph long weekly updates that are stuck in the discussion board, and you have to hunt for details on every assignment. Her projects are vague and uninteresting. I do not recommend this class!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzc5MjEy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2011-11-16 12:23:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was very easy and straight forward. There were two group projects, 10 quizzes, one individual assignment and a final exam which was an essay. This class is an easy A, I took it as a business elective. The only thing that I did not like about this professor is that she is not very involved.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjUyOTQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2011-10-25 10:22:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Online. Every week you do 1 chapter with a quiz(you can take 3 times) and discussion board(requires 4 postings). There's also a group case analysis, a final team project and 1 individual assignment. She seems to be a pretty easy grader so far on these written assignments. Overall ok class.

She basically opens the text and asks if anybody has any questions.  she demands a lot of work for this class. online quizzes for every chapter.

Prof. Xu is usually a pleasant teacher although she occasionally becomes very rude. The class organization was extremely poor and nearly impossible to follow, the workload was ridiculously large and convoluted. I DO NOT recommend her it you're going abroad, it was nonstop stress.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0Njg5NjE2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2008-05-08 09:38:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not too difficult of a class as long as some amount of effort is given.  It will make her day if someone actually participates in class without being called on (which she does do to see if you're keeping up with the reading). Take notes on the videos shown in class.  Her verbal communication skills are not strong, but getting better.
