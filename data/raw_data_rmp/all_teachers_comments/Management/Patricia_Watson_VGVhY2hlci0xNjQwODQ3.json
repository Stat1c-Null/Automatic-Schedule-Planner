Maybe students are mad about their grades. Read instructions and follow them and you will make a good grade. Our class always got grades back in a reasonable amount of time, always before the next assignment so we could read her very detailed feedback.

Even though it's online, you have to be committed to 1)  meeting virtually online in class presentations, 2) having to meet virtually online with your team.  There is not clear direction in group projectspresentations.  Most grades were not updated until after the final day of class.

We spent more class time talking about the confusing 40 page syllabus than actual content.  She said she was just given this class right before it started so didn't have time to review someone else's syllabus. Looks like this is at least the second semester.

But now, I wish I would have listened. She did not post grades throughout the semester and she followed another professors syllabus so any questions you had, she could not clearly answer them!

She expects you to always refer to the syllabus which was 20 pages long and all of her instructions are very vague in content.
