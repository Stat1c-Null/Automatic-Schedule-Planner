Absolutely unrealistic expectations, group project for half your grade, instructions about as clear as mud. Weekly discussions that are basically impossible to get 100% on. Tests are straight forward, only 3 of them. The entire class revolves around the semester long  project. Not timely in replies to messages. DO NOT TAKE!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTA4MzAx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Participation matters--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT3600","date_posted":"2016-11-29 09:06:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"EXTREMELY hard professor for an introductory class. Treats this class as though it is an advanced course, tough grader. Discussions due every week and will deduct points if you do it all the same day. I took this as a business elective and wouldn't do it again.

It's an intro course & he treats it like it's a advanced course. Do bother doing extra credit bc he won't give you the points at the end of the semester, he'll say their included in participation. Test are fill in the blank, essay, t/f, multiple choice very hard. I don't recommend him!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjM5MjM2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"Y","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
