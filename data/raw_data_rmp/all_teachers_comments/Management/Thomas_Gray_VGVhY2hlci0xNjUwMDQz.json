You don't have to come to the class and still make an A. EASY A!!! You don't have to read the book at all. Every week he gives a quiz with 10 questions. But they are easy, you just have to know the definitions from the book. I fyou read 1 hour before the quiz you will still make 100. He drops 3 lowest quizzes.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyMTc5OTE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2013-01-09 19:10:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good at what he teaches","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMjM3NTc4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
