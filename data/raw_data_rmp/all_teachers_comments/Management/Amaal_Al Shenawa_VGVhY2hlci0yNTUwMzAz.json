I still stand by most of what I said regarding the hard to follow accent and her VERY slow grading (2 months late). However, her willingness to help definitely gives her more credit than a 1 star rating, there are worse teachers here than her","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzk2MDEx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CM4560","date_posted":"2025-03-20 19:58:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"She does have an accent but is very willing to go out of her way to help you.

She mostly points at our professors work and tries to explain as best she can. I had to take the class again bc I got sick and she wouldn't let me make up anything I missed.

Her lectures are very disorganized and do not make sense. You can barely understand what she is saying and it is very difficult to follow her lectures. She does a horrible job at explaining the material, so you will be teaching yourself in this class.
