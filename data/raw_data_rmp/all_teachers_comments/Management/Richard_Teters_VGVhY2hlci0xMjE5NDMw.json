There are a lot of assignments that require a lot of your time. He intentionally gives vague directions on everything to simulate the 'real' business world so just expect that going into it. On the other hand, the tests are very reasonable and he is a VERY easy grader as long as you show effort.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDI1NDk1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4120","date_posted":"2012-07-15 20:38:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Most boring class ever and he makes it even more boring by being monotoned. However, it is a fairly easy class as long as you do your work it's pretty much a satisfactory / unsatisfactory grading system. There's a group game to play which takes up the majority of the class and his tests are only 2 questions each.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNDkzODEy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4120","date_posted":"2010-12-17 09:31:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Teters was a nice guy and he seems knowledgeable about the general info I would need to start a business.

As long as you can show Teters that you are learning something, he will grade you well. I got A's on everything I did. He allows you to turn in everything in advance for critique. It can seem a little overwhelming, but he really just wants to see that you are thinking/applying concepts!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjY3MTQy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4170","date_posted":"2009-01-03 11:30:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Teters is a nice guy.He has a lot of experience in the business world but he has a strange method of teaching.Rarely teaches from the book.Simulation game is a huge part of your grade and a pain.No tests or quizzes, just the final exam.If you get to know him personally and come to class he'll have mercy on you come grading time.Syllabus is useless.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzA5MDQ0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4120","date_posted":"2008-12-12 00:10:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"Teters is a nice guy.
