Also 3 tests that are super easy.

He was probably the best professor I have ever had in my five years in college. His lectures were so useful and were easy to learn, we have a couple projects but they are so easy to complete. He gives feedback and is able to help you whenever you need.

The lectures were really fun, and always had plenty of clips from The Office. He also allowed for plenty of class discussion. The tests aren't hard if you just review the slides, and outside of that you only have to do a group project.
