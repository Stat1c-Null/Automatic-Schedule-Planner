There aren't any tests and there's no final, just quizzes (no webcam), smart books, and group projects. The projects are easy A's though. Shes very nice, responds to emails, and grants extra credit assignments.

I took this as a hybrid so it was only 1 day a week and attendance didn't count so I never showed back up after the second week so can't speak on lectures. No test, just weekly smart books and the easiest \"group project\" ever (everyone does their own work and you basically just combine it all on the word doc template that she makes for you)","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5Mzc1MjE4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
