She posted all the lectures but you really have to read the textbook to succeed. Also, get ready to do lots of math. Group project in the class, but it wasn't too bad. Overall, she's a good professor and was accessible outside of class! If you read the textbook and study, you'll be okay.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMTYwNDg3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2024-12-27 19:14:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"The exams are on LockDown Browser but don't require a webcam. She is very nice and tries to work with the students. The class is more tedious but not super hard. The exams are challenging and more math-heavy than expected, but they don't hurt your grade too much. I would definitely recommend. The group project at the end was pretty easy!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNDQ2MjQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2024-12-14 15:05:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. Attendance is mandatory. The tests are open not in lockdown. She is a kind teacher, but her tests are in two parts and extremely hard. Thankfully they do not weigh a ton on your overall. She goes through examples using excel which you are not able to use on the exam which makes a huge difference","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjk0NjQy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Test heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2024-11-23 05:50:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good professor, hard class. Thought things were well put together, She seemed nice through email. Tests were hard, but they were the first time I took this class with a different professor too. I just don't like it when an online class has a group project, let alone one that makes you tour a facility in person.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDE4OTYx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"C","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Test heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2024-11-22 02:53:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class has not been easy, but the subject matter is just difficult. I know few people who got through OP Mgt without a struggle regardless of the professor. But Professor Ishak is very supportive and caring. Her class is well laid out and she explains exactly what she expects. She also allowed me to make up an assignment in a time of need.
