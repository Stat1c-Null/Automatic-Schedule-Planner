He is the boss and the students are the employees. This means he expects the work, but he is also understanding. Focus during his lectures, and take good notes from his examples; it is that simple.

Requires a 20 page paper about where a product comes from. Main problem is that class is tedious. He'll try to elicit a response with a vague question like \"what happened in Japan?\".
