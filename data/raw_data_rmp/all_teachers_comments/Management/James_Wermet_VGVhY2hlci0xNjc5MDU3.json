Go to class and participate in his discussion.  Other than that you have two write two papers for the Midterm and Final and I wouldn't call them papers but more like short essays which probably take an hour if you have half a brain.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNjQ1Njg4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2012-09-15 22:26:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Wermert is an awesome professor.  He knows it all about business.  Attendance is not mandatory but if you don't go you wont make a good grade in the class.  He doesn't use the book.  He puts a case up every week.  Read it and go to class and talk about it.  Midterm and Final are so easy if you go to class everyday.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNjQ1Njg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
