So much time and attention have to go into it while also trying to do the homework and test. This semester we not only had the group project but also had group case studies. It can be very overwhelming, especially if people in your group are not self-sufficient.

It's meant to be easy, but you just have to do all of the assignments. Do not slack off at the beginning either, as there are discussions to be done within the first 2 months. No tests, one independent paper and one group paper. Papers worth massive amount of grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODYwODAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4190","date_posted":"2022-12-08 19:19:28 +0000 UTC","comment":"Avoid this professor at all costs! Does not care about any of his students. Alot of classwork and assignments, barely had time to work on other classes cause he assigned SO much work. Very vague class discussions that are heavily graded even though its our own opinions and thoughts. 2 group projects that are both 15+ pages each.

No joke, most of us got below a C on the exams because they were multi part and getting one part wrong cost you the whole question. His paper was insane, 4000 word minimum on operations management with min 18 published academic references. Never stressed so much about a class that wasn't my major (marketing).","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzAxNjkw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2021-12-03 21:23:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"So much of this class is outlined by the extensive math homework this guys assigns, i had no time for other classes with how crazy his expectations were. Practice exams for extra credit? yeah right the guy gave us practice exams but they were over 200 lengthy math questions, who in their right mind would assign that.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MzYzNjkx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Get ready to read--Test heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2021-05-15 20:34:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class, &amp; even the group project is not hard. Follow the rubrics &amp; you can get a 100 on the project &amp; discussions. He also has a lot of opportunities for you to get extra credit. However, he doesn't teach anything. You have to read a 40-page chapter every week w/ the only supplement being the book-provided powerpoints.
