Course was very easy. Professor Boyd made the class super simple and easy to follow along. I took her as a HYBRID course. Videos/ lectures were online and easy to follow. There's 8 in-class assignments, 5 of highest are graded. 2 in class group assignments, also very easy. She has a peculiar personality and loves to teach.
