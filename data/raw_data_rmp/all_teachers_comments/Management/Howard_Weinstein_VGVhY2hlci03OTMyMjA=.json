Don't need book. 1 page essay due before each class, but are easy. 3 tests & group project make up most of the grade. He gives you the info that will be on the tests. He wants students to participate & really cares about his students doing well.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTc4MzU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Respected--Get ready to read--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2017-04-28 11:52:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Weinstein is the most insightful professor I've had at KSU. He is so knowledgable from his real life experiences. You have a case study to read before almost every class and write a page about it, a capstone project, tests aren't hard, expects you to speak up in class, and does take attendance.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTUyNjcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2017-04-24 17:21:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Busy work, but if you do it you will get an A; three tests, two of which you can bring your notes to. The first test he gave you the questions which could be on it and then picked a few. He's pretty funny and the lectures are interesting. I would recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTEyNjM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2014-11-19 09:20:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Weinstein brings a vast amount of knowledge as he is a Harvard Business School graduate. His class won't be an \"easy A\" but you will learn from this wise man. The daily business cases encourage students to THINK. These are done individually & then discussed in class on the day they're due. Class participation is graded. Exams are tough.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzODQ4MjI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4199","date_posted":"2014-05-06 01:19:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"A waste of time with no value added to critical thinking or analytical reasoning skills.
