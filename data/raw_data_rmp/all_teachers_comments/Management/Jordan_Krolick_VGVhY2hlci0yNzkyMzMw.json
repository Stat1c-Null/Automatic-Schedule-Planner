He also has guest speakers that are very entertaining. Many were business executives. There are two projects but very manageable and he provides a detailed rubric.

He provided several zoom sessions with great networks throughout the semester. We got to learn from his knowledge and knowledge from other experienced people in the franchise industry.

It was a small class that allowed him to get to know everyone on a personal basis. He has been extremely successful in business and with that has fantastic connections that he brought to class such as CEOs. I would take his class again in a heartbeat if possible.
