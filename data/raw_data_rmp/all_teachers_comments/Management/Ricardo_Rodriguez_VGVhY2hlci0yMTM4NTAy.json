Grade is only 7 quizzes (takes highest attempt), 2 exams, attendance, and a really easy group powerpoint presentation. Everything is open book. He only teaches evening classes, but it was worth it imo since all the other MGT 3200 professors had okay reviews. The professor is also super friendly and a nice guy!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDIxMzY2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Caring","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2024-05-07 20:45:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty easy overall just show up for attendance, only 2 tests, a group project, and a few quizzes.

He has a day job and likes video games and anime and is really nice. Gives constructive feedback and teaches you everything you need to know. Sometimes lectures put me to sleep a bit but I was also just exhausted by 9 PM.

The material on the tests will be covered in class so I never felt like he mislead the class on the material.

Based on two tests (which are based on lectures/PPTs), Connect quizzes, and a group project.
