The group project is AGONIZING because everything you do isn't up to her standard and she blames you for not knowing when it was herself who didn't give enough details on the assignment. She is very responsive but other than that AWFUL","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODE4ODYx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Group projects","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4001","date_posted":"2024-10-14 14:15:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took her online class, she is very communicative, if you email her you will get a response the same or next day. But oh my god she grades like she works for the CIA and CANNOT give details on assignments. My group almost failed because she didn't tell us critical info on the assignment and blamed us for not being able to read her mind.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODExMjcz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4001","date_posted":"2023-12-15 00:49:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Not bad of a class. There's 3 exams that are proctored unfortunately but she does allow a one page one side cheat sheet and a semester-long group project that wasn't hard which has as much grade weight as the exams. Plus some very easy Mcgraw hill homework. It was all on me that I could've done better but this was a good and interesting class.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjgxNDE0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lots of homework--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4001","date_posted":"2023-06-19 18:37:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"If I could give Dr. Kessler a 6 out of 5 I would. She has been the most inspirational, accommodating, impactful professor I have ever had. There are too many anecdotes to list, but she also provides easy extra credit and is willing to go the extra mile for your career. Her personality is also great and she makes you feel safe and helps you develop.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MDU1NTcz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4001","date_posted":"2022-10-25 16:57:40 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you decide to take Dr. Kessler, best of luck.  She is a very harsh grader on the long, vigorous Group project.  ALL test are lockdown with webcam.  And there are weekly Smartbooks, Cengage assignments, and web activities that will take you a long time each week.  Expect a long, harsh semester with busy work and 3 tough exams.

She gives wonderful lectures and keeps every class interesting even when it is boring content. She always applies the concepts to students' real life experiences. She really cares about her students and wants them to succeed after her class.

The group project can be difficult and instructions are not well-written but if you follow the instructions well you will be fine.
