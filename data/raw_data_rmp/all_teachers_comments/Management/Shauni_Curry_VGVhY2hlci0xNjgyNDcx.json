They are pretty outdated. Otherwise, it was a great course!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwMjc3Njg2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
