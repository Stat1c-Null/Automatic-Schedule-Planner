He grades based upon his opinion which is ok if you find it out ahead of time. Most of your learning will be outside of class. Very helpful if you ask him things outside of class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjY1OTgy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT8535","date_posted":"2010-08-07 16:15:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Harvard professor who knows his stuff.  You will learn a lot from him and its an easy A if you just do the business plan.  He's getting older and a little scatter-brained but can answer any question!  Recommend if you want to have your own business one day.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NDg5Njgy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT8900","date_posted":"2009-05-20 13:53:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"By far the best experience of my life. This professor places you in real world situations through participation in collegiate level business plan conpetitions. Not only do you learn how to develop a top notch business plan but you also learn how to actually launch an effective business. You'll never regret learning what this professor has to teach.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODczMzM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
