Throughout lectures there are \"pop quizzes\" that count for attendance but not for an actual grade. Attendance counts for a small portion of your grade. Only have to do half of weekly discussion posts and theres a group project but grades pretty easy. Tests are easy if you study even a little.

She uses PowerPoints for the lecture, but listen to what she adds to each point b/c that's what's on the test. All tests are conceptual/appliction, not memorization. Weekly discussion posts. Easy assignments, easy group project, attendance counts toward your grade, overall easy class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTU2NjMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Clear grading criteria--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
