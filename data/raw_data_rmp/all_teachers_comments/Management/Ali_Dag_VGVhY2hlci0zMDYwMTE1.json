Great professor. Each week/module is well organized and he lays out expectations for assignments clearly, with an introduction video each week and Excel application videos which make the completion of assignments very straightforward.

A few hours of work a week, with one Excel assignment, a quick Smartbook assignment, and a Connect quiz. He has videos to teach you everything and walks you through the Excel assignment. Two lockdown tests with a similar study guide and an easy group project that takes two hours.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjYyNTc2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
