Easy course but don't expect him to remember who you are unless you're an athlete. Overall would not take the class again I constantly participated and received a C in participation resulting in my A going to an 89%.

He had unrealistic expectations and did not clearly share those expectations. . The material was interesting but his teaching style made it boring and stale. I was looking forward to this class but ended up having a strong dislike for anything marketing related, glad this was not my concentration.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTI4Mzk5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT8050","date_posted":"2020-07-23 03:20:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you have the option, choose another professor. This class was unrealistic demanding, but that's ok. The problem was that he did not have clear grading criteria and he was not clear about the expectations of the assignments at all.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTI3NDg5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT8050","date_posted":"2020-07-22 02:29:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you can take any other teacher, please do. He wasn't clear about his assignment expectations at all. He claimed to give important information about assignments and deadlines when he never said anything to that effect. He only teaches to hear himself speak. He was rude when answering questions and was dismissive about the start of BLM protests.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTI0NDQx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
