She is extremely well organized, very helpful, and makes the subject very interesting.  Her exams are fair and straight from the text.

Really knows the subject matter and I work in the HR field so I can tell. She enjoys teaching and is very thorough but very fair as well.

Exams are essay and regurgitating difinitions.  She's more research/academic with minimal experince, nothing is related to how its really applicable in the real world.

Workload is reasonable.  Tries very hard to make everything applicable and encourages stories from class.  But the tests; all essay, tries to be practical, but really you have to memorize the slides, the grading is not subjective if you agree with her, grades consistently but tough.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTU0NDI0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGMT8050","date_posted":"2009-03-23 15:24:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Good communicator, organized and used good examples.
