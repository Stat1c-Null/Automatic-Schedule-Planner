Dr. Pammy is the MOST excellent professor that the CM department has to offer. She is helpful and wants all students to succeed. If you gain nothing from the class, it's on you bc she sets students up for success. I wish I would've taken her in the fall to have a full semester instead of summer.

It is a waste of time. You will have random assignments posted throughout the semester with no warning and 3+ hour long lecture videos from over two years ago.

Only talks about her time in GA tech and compares it to everything. Its not the best that she is the only one who can teach this class.

One of the most caring professors Ive had. She seems strict and scary, but is one of the funniest and caring persons. Make sure you take good notes. Good notes= a good grade. 90% of the class is tests but she basically gives you everything to get an A. 10 percent is homeowrks. Highly reccommend.
