Her D2L is so unorganized and due dates are not clear at all, if you take her I would do all assignments besides tests during the first week of class to be safe. She does not respond to her emails and prefers to be texted? The only thing with clear due dates is her tests.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODQ1NzI0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BLAW2200","date_posted":"2020-11-18 20:38:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"She doesnt respond to emails, like, AT all. doesnt know how to correctly enter grades in d2l. Its pathetic. She obviously is not suit for online criteria. Our entire class has no idea what grade we have with 3 weeks left in the semester. So much BS work from McGraw Hill textbook  her laziness is evident. Avoid this teacher. Not worth it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODQzMTI3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
