The group project is pretty easy if you get a good group. She offers a super easy extra credit assignment worth 75 points.

Group project was not bad if you get a good group- she assigns the group. 2 parts, 1st part due at mid point, 2nd at end of semester.  4 discussion post and 5 test.

She seems very passionate about the subject, the course is well organized, and she is active and responsive.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mjc2NzE5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2021-12-13 04:51:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Blalock was awesome - really. I have no negative words to say about her, and thats saying a lot because I always seem to find fault in the structure of a class or the accessibility of a professor.

She doesn't post lectures, so the information may not really get in your head. Pretty quick feedback, but I would characterize the class by the group project (I'm not a fan of group projects).
