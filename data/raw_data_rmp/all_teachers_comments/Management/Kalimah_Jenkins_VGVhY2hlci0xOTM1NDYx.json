She graded papers from January in May, which left us clueless about our progress. In the end, the most intensive assignments were the ones that she chose to make a completion grade.

The workload is lowkey disrespectful and the entire class itself is completely unorganized. Only 1/2 of the assignments are listed in upcoming events and the requirements for each part is out of pocket.

I am writing this review to help you all out. The prof was straight forward, organized, helpful, accessible and fair. Most of all, I learned from this class.

The first two exam comes directly from the textbook. The third exam is the simulation (individually). Pick a good group for the simulation because that will determine most of your grade. The other part is 6 easy assignments in the beginning. Start the final papers early! The simulation is hard and complicated.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTM0NDQ2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--TEST HEAVY--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT4004","date_posted":"2017-06-10 17:52:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"We are only a week into the class, but I already don't like her.

There are two test(study the PowerPoint),do the paper over the emyth(easy read),do the franchise questionnaire in class when franchises come to class, and do the FDD project.

Half of the grade is MicroMatics which can be stressful, but if you understand it, you will pass easily. The semester is broken into 2 categories - book and micromatic.

She takes attendance but it only counts for 10% of final grade.  Only had a few assignments.
