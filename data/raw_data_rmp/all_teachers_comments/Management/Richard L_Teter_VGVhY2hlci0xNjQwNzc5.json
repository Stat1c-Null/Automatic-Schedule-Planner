You will have minimal time for other classes, working, or family time if you choose to use this magnificent hoarder of your time. Best of luck to you if you find his course to be your only option.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NjcyOTA5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4004","date_posted":"2014-05-09 16:06:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Teters is one of the best professors I've had while at Kennesaw. His class is rather unconventional but thats what I loved about it. He gives you the freedom to learn outside the boundaries of the typical classroom. Had him for both MGT 4003 and 4004. If you apply yourself it is easy to do well in his classes","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMjA5NTU4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
