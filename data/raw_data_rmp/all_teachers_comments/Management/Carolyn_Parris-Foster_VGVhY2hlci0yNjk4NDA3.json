I wish I could attach screenshots of her emails. I genuinely believe she did not read her own assignments. She had denied one of my assignments stating I hadn't followed directions and after me sending 3 emails asking how, \"there was an internal error. sorry.\"","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTEwOTky","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BUSA3150","date_posted":"2024-10-16 17:36:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is a very easy class and directions are straightforward. You submit your work and you are given feedback whether you have received the credit or not. The people who do not like this professor are people who cannot follow simple instructions or read. Do not hesitate on taking this professor you learn a lot regarding professionalism.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODE5Njg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BUSA3150","date_posted":"2024-10-08 03:23:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"The absolute worst professor I've ever taken. Dr. Foster was consistently rude and unhelpful when I reached out with questions about assignments and did nothing to answer them. The class itself is easy, but dealing with her was highly frustrating and made the work extremely unenjoyable. DO NOT take her.

This was not stated on syllabus. I requested the alternate assignment because I have cancer- my doctors told me to avoid large groups- provided doctors note.

Extremely rude when you reach out for help and does not try to help at all. Cleary does not care about success of students.

Both things I could've gone without, wish I saved my money and took this course with someone else. She takes it very seriously, rightfully so I suppose, but most of this is just reiterating things you learn in a junior high business class.

You will have to attend a career fair in person and dress up, but the other assignments are pretty easy. You only chat with the professor once during your career counseling for about 15 to 30 minutes. The class is a pass or fail.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NTE1OTAz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
