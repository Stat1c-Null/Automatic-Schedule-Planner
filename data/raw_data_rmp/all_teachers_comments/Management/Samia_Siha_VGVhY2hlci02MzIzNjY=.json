There are group work, weekly assignments, discussions, and quizzes.  There is a cumulative final that has to be taken on campus though.  The prof is usually helpful if you go to her.. if fact she did extend some deadlines.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEyNDk2OTY5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT8040","date_posted":"2006-08-01 15:19:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Creates good material but then reads from the material.

Email professor with questions on assignments and she'll explain everything.  Its online, so use your book on tests!!!  Just make sure you contribute to the discussions (two per week) and you'll do fine.  If one of your group members is a slacker it can make it a little harder, but the professor is very understanding.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExOTAxNjQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2006-05-05 13:06:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"took her online.  material and quizzes don't match up for the most part.
