The class should be titled, how to write a business plan, as the rest of the material seem like supporting material (and of little use). Otherwise, not a bad class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTczNjA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3200","date_posted":"2006-01-07 07:18:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome teacher for this class. There are 3 tests which he gives study guides/practice tests for. There is a group presentation and paper and an individual paper, but he does prepare you for them and grades fairly. Quizes are on web CT and class attendence is required but he actually makes class fun so it's not so bad!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExMzE4NDM4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGMT3200","date_posted":"2005-12-10 09:51:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class is not easy.  Marko Horn asks for alot but if you go to class, do the work, and study for the tests then you'll do fine.  There is alot of work but it is graded fairly.  You will get out of it what you put into it.  I would take him again for any management class.  He is a good professor.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTExMTA5ODY2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT4120","date_posted":"2005-08-31 09:15:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Terrific teacher!!!!  You'll work hard but you'll also learn a lot.  He's extremely helpful, enthusiastic, and insightful.  He's very good at using real world examples in correlation with the book/class material.

Is willing to do most anything to help his students.
