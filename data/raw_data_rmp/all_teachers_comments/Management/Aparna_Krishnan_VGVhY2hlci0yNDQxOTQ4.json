She grades things 2 months later. Going to class is a waste of my time, class projects and team groups done often. Her accent is thick and she talks fast. She is passionate about management but can not teach.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTg2MjY0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2019-05-30 04:00:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Shes a very sweet professor that clearly wants everyone to do well and utilize the class material in your work field. She brings up relevant videos and has group projects that are only to better your presentation skills. Exams and quizzes are online. The group project is not that hard. Easy A and attendance only counts as extra credit.

I have selected her for two classes throughout my career and wish she were teaching one of the last few that I have remaining.

Lectures get boring fast, but if you get perfect attendance she raises your final grade 4%, so just go and play on your phone. Tests are online in quiz form (no lockdown), so they are pretty easy. One class presentation and a service project with a group, not hard with good planning. You gotta be stupid to fail her.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzA5MTE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lecture heavy--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2019-03-25 01:19:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"She used the online resources which i really liked because of the variety in ways in which i could work.

You have to buy the connect textbook because there is homework on Learnsmart. There are 3 tests that you do online at home. The material is common sense and her lectures are boring. She'll give 20 extra credit points if you have perfect attendance,but it's not mandatroy. There are also 2 easy group projects.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNDY3ODAx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"MGT3100","date_posted":"2018-12-19 14:33:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"Super easy class, one easy discussion per week, midterm and final (got 100 on both) and then a final group project that is also easy.
