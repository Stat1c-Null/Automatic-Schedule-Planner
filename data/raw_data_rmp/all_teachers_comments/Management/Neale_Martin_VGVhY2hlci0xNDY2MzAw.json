He could probably teach anything well, but is very passionate about Behavior Management. This is a great course to take in a minimester session. Workload was reasonable and I learned some things that I can actually use in my home and work life.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NjQwMDU3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"MGT8900","date_posted":"2011-12-24 10:23:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Martin is the most interesting and knowledgeable professor I've had in the MBA program at Coles.
