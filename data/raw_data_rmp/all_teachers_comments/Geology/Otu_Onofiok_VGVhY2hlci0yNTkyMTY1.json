However, if you pace yourself, you can definitely get an A. You get 5 attempts on the labs and the quizzes are proctored, so you definitely need to understand the material.

It was hard to contact him and the work load was annoyingly time consuming.

About every 10 days, 3 assignments were due: lab, test, and SB assignment. Definitely not an easy class. You really have to work for your grade and be willing to read!
