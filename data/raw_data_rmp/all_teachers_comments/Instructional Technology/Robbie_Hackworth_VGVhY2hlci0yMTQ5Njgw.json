Nice lady but does not know material, does not allow students to help each other and then does not know how to help when asked. Constantly had problems with the computer--in a computer class. VERY strict on attendance and being late. Only positive part was that she gave out a lot of extra credit.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzgwNDcx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

This class would not be as hard as it was if the teacher had been helpful.  I had reached out to her countless times for help and she always made it seem like I was stupid and the only one not understanding the assignment. She never taught in class which made the quizzes hard and the assignments harder. She wouldn't even try to help you.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzI0NzUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

She is nice but this is the worst experience I have ever had with a professor. She doesn't seem very knowledgeable and most times she has to get other professors to explain lectures. She doesn't explain concepts and if you don't have prior knowledge of computers or applications, you will fail. She is nice but that is all","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTgyMTU2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
