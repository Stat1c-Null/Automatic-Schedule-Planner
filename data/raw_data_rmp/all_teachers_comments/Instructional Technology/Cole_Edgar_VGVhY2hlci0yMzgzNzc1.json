If you read and do your work, discussions and quizzes then you can get an easy A. The only complain I have is that some of the quizzes questions were not from the chapters that were suggested that week. The professor is very responsive and willing to help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzcxOTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
