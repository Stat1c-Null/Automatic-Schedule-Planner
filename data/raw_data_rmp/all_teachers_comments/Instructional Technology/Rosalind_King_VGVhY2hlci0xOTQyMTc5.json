I feel like someone else created this class and she's just a puppet or stand in because there weren't enough teachers to teach the course. Nothing is learned in class so if you're going to take this class I recommend online","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTIyODI5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT2101","date_posted":"2014-11-30 20:49:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"She makes ridiculous quizzes and tests , very strict grader, confusing instructions, doesn't ever clearly give an answer to a question, frequently makes grading mistakes.

She is scatterbrained, grades extremely toughly for no reason, doesn't explain anything, and doesn't actually TEACH. I doubt she even knows anything about what she's teaching.
