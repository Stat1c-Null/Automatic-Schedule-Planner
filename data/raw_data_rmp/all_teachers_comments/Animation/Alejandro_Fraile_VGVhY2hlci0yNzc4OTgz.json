There were a few projects that were a lil excessive in the workload than there needed to be. Sometimes it felt like we didn't have enough time to finish it all. He was a tough grader at first but is becoming more lenient. Wants good clean quality work!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MDk4MDcy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3620","date_posted":"2022-03-13 03:01:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"First time teaching, so he's still learning the ropes. Be patient as English isn't his 1st language (knows Spanish). Make sure to read the fine print in every project brief. The projects are a lot of work. Make sure to give feedback during critiques. Didn't touch storyboard pro till half way into the semester. Also use his storyboard formats.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1OTMwOTg5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
