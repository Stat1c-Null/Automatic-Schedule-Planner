But, he was new to teaching & had a hard time communicating what exactly he wanted especially since English wasn't his first language. Had an unreasonable high expectation for art standards and short deadlines. Didn't know Storyboard pro much.

Expected almost Disney-Level work in a matter of days, doesn't receive criticism too well, and overall had a hard time with him. Pushed forward the due date for next assignment when asked for an extra-day extension for project. Be prepared to overwork for him.
