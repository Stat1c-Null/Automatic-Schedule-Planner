Any interest you have or help you need, he will pull resources and make videos explaining the topics. Great projects with plenty of time to master them, and you learn so much about Z-Brush in his Modeling 2 course and it's integrations with programs.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4NjY5NzYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Gives good feedback--Hilarious","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM4630","date_posted":"2023-09-25 23:05:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Orlando treated you like a professional adult. He gave you assignments, gave you information on how to do it, then let you decide whether you wanted to be in class or outside of class. He cared a lot about us and wanted us to succeed, so he would also give us tips and extra information to help us out with projects. 100/10 professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MjM0NTg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3600","date_posted":"2021-03-16 20:15:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took Professor Orlando his first semester here at Kennesaw, and he was really nice.

He cares a lot about students and wants to do all he can to help your animation skills grow. He also understands that if you can't be in class, then you can't, so he lets you make adult decisions and have adult consequences.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTg2NTkz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
