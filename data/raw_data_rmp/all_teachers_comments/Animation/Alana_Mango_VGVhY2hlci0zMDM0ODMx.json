They were so understanding and patient that I was never afraid to ask them questions. They also helped us understand ToonBoom tools and animation skills we may have forgotten. I really appreciated how helpful they were. Definitely one of the best professors I've had here.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjE5MzA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ANIM3660","date_posted":"2025-05-01 16:30:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"They are such a nice and very fair professor!

Easy to ask questions, and even if they don't know the answer, they will help you figure it out or troubleshoot. I would always laugh in this class. Great balance of working and learning while still having fun.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDU0ODEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
