Show up to class and work throughout class and you wont have any issues getting an A. Listen to his constructive feedback during class and use it to fix any mistakes you have before grading.

Very approachable, and you can tell he cares about and enjoys what he's doing. Grading is fair and there are plenty of opportunities for help along the way if you ask.
