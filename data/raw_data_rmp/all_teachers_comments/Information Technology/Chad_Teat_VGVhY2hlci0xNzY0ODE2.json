[{"class":"IT4823","date_posted":"2020-10-16 14:58:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Teat's IT4823 class is pretty straightforward. There is a decent amount of work, but he's any easy grader just do your work and turn it in on time. However, he does not provide any feedback for assignments and just gives 100. The midterm was online without lockdown, all short answer, you can use resources just cite sources. It was strange","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzA2NzQ4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1301","date_posted":"2018-02-21 11:48:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Doesn't teach much. Throws up a few shorts 5-10 minute tutorial videos, a couple of powerpoints and notes, and sends you loose. So if you need lecture, you won't get it here. You're expected to do a lot on your own. Textbook is available for free but I wouldn't use; it's poorly written. VERY SLOW TO GRADE! Does not communicate much if at all.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NTgzNTkz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1301","date_posted":"2017-05-04 06:06:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty awful professor, at least online. Slow at grading, doesn't actually teach anything (modules are based on outdated video tutorials), and doesn't follow the syllabus. Never been so frustrated with a class in my life. I work my butt off, and sure, he gives you a 100, but there's no feedback. Makes you wonder if he even looks at your work or not","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjA3OTEz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CSE1301","date_posted":"2013-01-29 09:08:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Chad is an awesome teacher. He's definitely the most helpful and most knowledgeably teacher I've had yet. His class was pretty easy but he was always giving suggestions on how you can make the labs harder. This kept me engaged and allowed me to expand my knowledge even though I already new the course material.

Sarcastic. Very helpful. Not too hard of a class, but you are going to have to work for your grade. Focuses more on the real life application of programming. Has great knowledge about the computing field. Great guy to to. I am taking him again for 1324 and would definitely recommend his class to anyone.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMTk5MTk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSE1301","date_posted":"2012-12-15 18:51:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy is more about application than theory. He forces you to know how to code, which definitely helps more than simple lecture. He can be a \"smarty\" sometimes but he means well and will tell you otherwise. Very fair in grading. Great advice with almost everything he speaks about, even the career path.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxMDgzNTYw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CS1301","date_posted":"2012-11-11 12:58:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great teacher! He's sarcastic but very nice & engaging. It's a hard subject for some people but he's encouraging & very patient. He focuses on RL uses & offers valuable info on the professional world & getting a job. Always willing to help if needed. Not a free grade. He wants you to be able to code & be creative w/ it by the end of the semester.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODEyOTU2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
