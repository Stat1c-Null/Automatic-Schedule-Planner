They were easy though if you payed attention in class and understood the concepts. She wasnt too hard on the deadlines as long as you followed the rubric and did what you had to do. I got an A in the class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNTQzMjk4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3203","date_posted":"2019-11-09 16:45:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very kind professor, responds to emails in a timely manner, and is willing to help you with any issues you have on the work in this class. Theres 3 Assignments, 2 milestones ( projects) and a research paper. The Assignments and milestones are easy to do so if you do good on those the research paper is not that much of an issue.

She is always willing to help with any questions you have, even if with labs and tests. Tests and labs are take home and open book.
