Work can't be late if you turn it in - it is all due before finals week. Sympathetic to problems. Only a tough grader if you do not use references.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NjE4OTA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR4330","date_posted":"2021-05-12 14:44:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"Absolutely recommend Alison (prefers first name)! Very sweet and caring. My book arrived late, so she extended a quiz two weeks. Answers emails promptly and in-depth to make sure you understand. Easy grader and provides lots of feedback. Weekly quizzes, 3 discussions, 3 assignments, open-book midterm/final.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NzczODM5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
