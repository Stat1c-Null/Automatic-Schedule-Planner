The class itself was extremely easy and not many assignments. The main bad thing was the lack of on-time grading. Most grades did not come through until the end of the semester.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Nzk5MjM4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3503","date_posted":"2013-12-28 15:12:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this class online. It really is an easy class, but it is also fun. Tests, Finals, and Quizzes, and all are open-book, so they are easy enough.
