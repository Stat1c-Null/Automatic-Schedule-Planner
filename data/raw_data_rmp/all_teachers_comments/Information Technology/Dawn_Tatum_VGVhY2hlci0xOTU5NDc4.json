All you have to do is participate in an internship during the semester and you can get a Major Elective credit for it. The teacher's requirements are very straightforward and this course is Pass/Fail, so unfortunately it doesn't boost your GPA.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0ODEyOTg3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Graded by few things","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1324","date_posted":"2017-03-21 08:45:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall Mrs Tatum was excellent. A lot of the homework that she made us complete. We did an example in class that was very similar. Gave extra credit opportunities, I strongly advise you take advantage of those they will come in handy more than you know.

She does not have the best skills at explanation, but she will respond to any questions and she is always available in her office if you need her.  Don't skip her lectures, if you do, you'll miss the meat of the material.

Overall, it was an easy class if you actually follow along with the course work and are interested in Java programming.  My major problem with this class was the tests/quizzes had syntax errors that skewed your answers.  The professor dropped all the quizzes due to this and I don't think my exams were corrected.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NTMyMTMw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1324","date_posted":"2016-12-05 18:33:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Tatum was a great teacher.

She is a real gem of a teacher. Really involved with her students and makes an effort to be fair. I would without a doubt take a class with her again. I would recommend though to those who need external motivation, to go to another professor. She will not babysit you, but fosters creativity.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MzI0MjUy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Caring--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT4323","date_posted":"2016-11-19 19:45:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took her online for Data Communication.
