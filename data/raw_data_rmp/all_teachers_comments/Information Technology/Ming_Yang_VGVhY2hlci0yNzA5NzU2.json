Textbook is online and corresponds with the quizzes, there are PowerPoints but I would not rely on them for quizzes. Discussion posts are easy, and for labs, although they can be long and confusing at times, he gives credit as long as you try.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjczMTcy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT4323","date_posted":"2023-11-26 19:20:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall, a good professor who is an easy grader and responds very well. The class was not too bad with a few discussions scattered through the semester and almost weekly quizzes which are open notes. Two exams that are long but open notes. Also, 5 labs that were throughout the semester but he graded them very easily, seemed as if for completion.

Really nice guy. I always got an extension and I asked like 3 times.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTY5OTEx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT4323","date_posted":"2022-08-07 22:51:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took him for Data Comm. and Networking online. Very easy grader, graded for completion. Tests were long but not hard. Quizzes are open book/ open note so those are easy. Regarding course material, we were just expected to read and look at PowerPoint slides, which is the same as most of these IT classes I have taken so far. Take him, he's chill.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTY5OTAy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Respected--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
