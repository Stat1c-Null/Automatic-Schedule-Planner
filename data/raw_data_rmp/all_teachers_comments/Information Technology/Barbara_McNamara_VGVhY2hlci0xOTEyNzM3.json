Teaches from book and furnished powerpoints.  I came to learn, but didn't learn much from her.    I stopped paying attention in class.  Just come on test review days and study hard.  I got 95+ on all tests just by cramming.  Very nice lady, not a good teacher.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjkyMTcw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IT3223","date_posted":"2017-04-25 11:47:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof  McNamara is an excellent professor.  I think she is given a bad rap by those who are just disinterested in the class.  I find her to be fair and extremely helpful.  She does not design the class, KSU does.

She gives extra credits and understanding  when technology does not work.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MTE5MTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--LOTS OF HOMEWORK--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3223","date_posted":"2017-04-24 17:35:12 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof McNamara is an excellent teacher.

She has been working in the field of software engineering for a majority of her career, and it really shows in her lectures.
