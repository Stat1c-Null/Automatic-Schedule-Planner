Gave me a zero on an assignment that I told her she never opened for me and will not respond to my emails at all. I have done all the assignments on time and this one I had to turn in late & she gave me a zero after claiming to \"look into it\" & get back with me which she never did.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODA1ODQx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"C-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3423","date_posted":"2022-12-16 17:56:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is good but you will have a tuff time getting in touch with her.

LOTS of busy work that is unrelated to the class description. Fortunately though, the class is pretty easy.
