She places lots of emphasis on group projects and class participation. Her lectures will typically engage the class, as she likes to hear feedback when teaching. She takes notice of the effort you show in class and will use that when grading.

Class is mainly group projects and it's not always clear if it was a full group project or to split the groups. Besides that it's a super easy class and you can easily get away with not trying, most of the information is common sense.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTU1MDE3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3203","date_posted":"2025-03-16 22:17:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing professor.

This is the worst online course I have taken. She uploads lectures partway and links to random websites through the module, half of which lead to 404s. Seems she's finding them as we go.

Beware of strict grading! She gave me an 82% on a paper because I wrote the wrong course number and only had one citation.
