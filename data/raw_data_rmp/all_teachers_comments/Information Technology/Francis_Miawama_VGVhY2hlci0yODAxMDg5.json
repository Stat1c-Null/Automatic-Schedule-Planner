He insists on you reading the assignment instructions carefully before asking any clarification about the assignment. But he is always there to work with you. He gave amnesty to the class to help us catch up on our late submissions.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjA1NTI4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1113","date_posted":"2024-12-13 20:22:59 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had professor Miawama for my Intro to Programming (Python). He was very accessible. He had a weekly online live sessions for us to come and interact with him, go over the materials, demonstrate codes, or go over our homework and lab questions. He knew how to explained Python in a way that it was easy to do the labs. He is an awesome teacher!
