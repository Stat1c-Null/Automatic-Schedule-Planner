I was lucky to have previous programming experience going into the course. The exams and quizzes were open notes so it was easy to tackle, make sure to start the programming assignments early and you'll do fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjkwNzg1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Lots of homework--Beware of pop quizzes","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR3300","date_posted":"2024-12-10 15:47:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class honestly wasn't too bad. The only problem was the Clearwater software we used rarely worked properly, but that was not her fault. She responded to emails quickly and graded fairly so I believe that was great. The midterm, final, and project make up like 60% of the grade so those are pretty important.

But the class itself is a pain, literally, my only B this semester because I failed both the midterm and final (each one was over 300-500 slides also lockdown/camera). A couple of very time-consuming projects but this class was just annoying.

Her class was really easy, no attendance policy and all of the tests/quizzes were open note. Only downside was it was a 3 hour course. Good thing about that is attendance wasn't required. She's cool and nice, though.
