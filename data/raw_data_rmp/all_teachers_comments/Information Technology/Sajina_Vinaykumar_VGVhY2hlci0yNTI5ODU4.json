All she does is read through a PowerPoints all class.

Understands that students have jobs and a life outside of the class, so she helps if you start falling behind. Lots of the assignments are done in class together and the quizzes were unlimited attempts. Wasn't afraid to help during or after class if you got stuck. Test were in person, but unlimited notes!

Her assignments are all over the place, and she randomly assigns discussion questions. The labs and quizzes are the easiest part. The non-lab homework sucks and takes forever, and her instructions can be unclear and confusing. She responds pretty quick and is willing to help. Her organization skills are just terrible.
