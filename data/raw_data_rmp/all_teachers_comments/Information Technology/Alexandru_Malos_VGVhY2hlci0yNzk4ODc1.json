A scheduled class time for guidance, especially for those new to programming, would be very helpful. While he provided code skeletons and examples, more direct support or interaction would have improved the overall learning experience.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMzIxMDc1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Lots of homework--Online Savvy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3503","date_posted":"2022-12-14 02:45:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Another out of date KSU course, but the professor made the best of it.

I have no doubt he'll improve the course as time goes on. A+ teacher, truly cares about his students and what he is teaching.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2Mzc2NjY2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Clear grading criteria--Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT4232","date_posted":"2022-05-12 23:36:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Malos is a new professor, but boy is he an improvement and great addition to the IT/CCSE department. He's lenient with due dates (if you have a good reason) and lets you use notes during quizzes/tests/the final. Labs are time-consuming, so be sure to start working on them early in the week.
