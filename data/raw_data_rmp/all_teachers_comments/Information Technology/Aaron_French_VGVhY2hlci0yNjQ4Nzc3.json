You'll have to work in a project with no prior experience in the tools required while working in a group. In my case, I had a bad luck and my group was full of lazy people who did not participate in the project, therefore I had to complete the project on my own. Not a good experience for me, but good class overall.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTcxNTMy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS8090","date_posted":"2023-12-11 15:17:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. French is very knowledgable and conducts intelligent in-class discussions based on recorded lectures that students watch before class. Exams are tough, and you really have to pay attention to every little detail he says in class. Group projects are easy and relatively fun to complete (if you have a good group). Would recommend!

He had periodical quizzes, participation requirements (class, certain ISENG events, etc), conducted mock interviews (was only for participation grade, but gave you feedback on things to improve, etc). There was a semester long competition group project graded by employers & professor.

His class only has a midterm, a final, and two group projects. In person exams are challenging and you will have to work for your grade (if you don't have an IT background). But he really cares about his students, makes the class enjoyable, and pre-records his lectures. Overall I do recommend taking him.

He expects a lot but is fair and accessible. His lectures provide great examples of the concepts he is presenting. There is a lot of group work in this class, weekly quizzes and two exams. The quizzes/exams cover material from both the lectures and textbook. He provides timely and useful feedback for projects.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjY0MDU4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IS8090","date_posted":"2021-01-16 19:07:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"He likes to talk about tech, is experienced, good to learn from, tests weren't bad, but lectures are long. Thought class took a lot of work and he took it a bit too serious. In 3 instances he shared left leaning opinions then immediately said &quot;I'm not going to talk politics,&quot; I'd rather they just weren't shared. Nice guy overall.
