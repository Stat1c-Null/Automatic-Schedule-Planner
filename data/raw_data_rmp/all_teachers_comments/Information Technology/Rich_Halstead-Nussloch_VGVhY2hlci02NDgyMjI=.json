He's an amazing professor, highly recommend. Coursework leans on the light side if you manage your time wisely. Course projects weren't too stressful and tied in to the coursework done during the semester. Weekly meetings were optional, but he's so nice that I always feel bad for missing them.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1ODYzMDM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT7713","date_posted":"2021-12-07 03:40:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Rich is one of my favorite professors! This was my second class with him and I signed up for a third.
