I quote from experience and other classmates, his response to emails \"It's in the syllabus\" .  Takes forever to grade, doesn't respond to emails in a timely manner.  Didn't use his own material for the course.  Borrow from another professor.  Avoid Professor White if possible.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjQ4Njgy","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IT3203","date_posted":"2014-04-30 18:13:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"At first I thoroughly enjoyed the class. Mr. White would use video podcasts for visual aid, but that was all gone during the second half of the semester. I felt like he was rude and unfriendly with the students when replying in the discussions. He didn't seem concerned that most of his students were struggling. I personally wouldn't recommend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTM0MTQ3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not_Sure_Yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":4,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
