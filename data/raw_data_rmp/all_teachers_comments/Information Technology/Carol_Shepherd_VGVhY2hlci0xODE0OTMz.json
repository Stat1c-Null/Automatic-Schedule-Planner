She is quirky but that makes her fun. She wants her students to learn & she prepares you for what employers will expect. She does offer \"gab labs\" during weekends and nights if students are having trouble.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyODgzNTI0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT5302","date_posted":"2013-12-18 10:20:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Didn't stick to the syllabus. Assigned projects that were way beyond an entry course. Never posted grades during the term. Required a final exam and final project, both of which were beyond the scope of an intro course. The final was riddled with errors. Received ZERO feedback during the term. Prof requires you to use visit three different sites.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIyNTk5MjAw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT5200","date_posted":"2013-05-02 15:00:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the worst professor I met.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjU4Nzk3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
