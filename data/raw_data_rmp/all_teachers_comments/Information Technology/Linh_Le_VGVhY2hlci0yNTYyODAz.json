There was no final, but during finals he gave us extra credit to complete any missed assignments. He also opened up a quiz that I had missed. He came to me and let me know I didn't even have to ask him. This ensured my grade with an A. Also, he posted video lectures that were so helpful. He really does care.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NDE5MDA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1323","date_posted":"2020-07-25 04:30:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Le is the BEST professor you can take for programming. I had him for both lecture and lab. He gives you so many resources that it makes it impossible not to get an A. Two attempts for quizzes, extra credit, and insanely accessible for all questions. I never once needed any external help. It honestly doesnt get better than him.

Prof. Le prepared for each lecture and tried to help students understand the materials as well as finish labs with his availability during office hours. However, reading and studying are students' tasks to build own knowledge in DBs. He wouldn't give direct hints for problems to trigger your smart thinking. No pain, no gain.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzg3Nzk1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
