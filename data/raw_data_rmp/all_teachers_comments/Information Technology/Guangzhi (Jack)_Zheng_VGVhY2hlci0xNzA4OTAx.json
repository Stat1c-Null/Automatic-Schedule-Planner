There were a lot of PPTs to read through. He should've given more detailed feedback on assignments, but he didn't grade too harshly.

It is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to achieve a 100% on anything in his classes. BI course load is heavy - 2 projects instead of the 1 usual group project most courses require. Feedback is not detailed. Strict grader. Doesnt take constructive criticism well.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1Mzc4NTUw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IT6713","date_posted":"2020-11-09 20:20:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the many nonsense professors at KSU. Unclear instruction. Always ask for more details but never tell you or can give you a clear example work with the details that he is looking for. Some lecture notes are posted in D2L but others are posted in other website that you cannot download to study. Super unorganized.

I keep running into bad professors at the school that do not give clear guidance, very harsh grading but does not give any clear or instructive feedback, it was always &quot;Need more details&quot;.

Vague and overly general feedback (example: &quot;you need a better HTML table&quot;). You'll come across syntactical/semantic errors in his quizzes quite often. He's also difficult to approach.
