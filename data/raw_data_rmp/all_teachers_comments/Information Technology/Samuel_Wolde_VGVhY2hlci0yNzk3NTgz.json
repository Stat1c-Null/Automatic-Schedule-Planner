Hopefully they fix that for future semesters. The professor gave 100s on everything manually graded, so it helped to offset the grade drop due to exams. Otherwise, class was chill. Assignments due every 2 wks, and more than adequate time given for research paper.

You usually have two weeks to submit an assignment. The subject material is a bit outdated (but that's more so a KSU problem). He's a fair grader, but not the most responsive to emails.

Most modules were links to outside sources - many of which 404'd. Prof could have checked content for errors before posting but couldn't be bothered to do the minimum. Quizzes and tests often had questions over material never covered. Disappointing. Issue is likely course specific, so pick another if you can.
