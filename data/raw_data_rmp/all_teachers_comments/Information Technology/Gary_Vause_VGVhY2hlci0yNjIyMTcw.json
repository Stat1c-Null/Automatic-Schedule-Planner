Facilitators are bad enough, but this man doesn't even know how to run D2L Brightspace. He started off the semester by grading discussions in a different way than stated in the syllabus and proceeded to trying to silently update it, not knowing it shows that it was change. No passion.

Wish I could rate him a 0. Second semester at KSU. Started the semester by changing the syllabus and not telling the class, then graded using the new syllabus, among other tricks. Absolute joke.

The class was online only and he sends out an email about a mandatory meeting that we have to attend while I am at work. I didn't have a single grade until week nine. If you ever get stuck trying to contact him he will depend on you to fix his course. Beyond disappointing.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjA3Njky","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CYBR4323","date_posted":"2020-12-17 16:02:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dont listen to the guy below me. They are just happy since Vause gave up and handed out 100s at the end. Sure he did not give up and die on the hill, that because he just gave up didnt show up on the hill.

It was his first time teaching and he may have picked up too many classes to start. The semester started off shaky but honestly the overall experience was good. Mr Vause is not the type to Die on this Hill so to speak, he adjusted and adapted as the semester went on.
