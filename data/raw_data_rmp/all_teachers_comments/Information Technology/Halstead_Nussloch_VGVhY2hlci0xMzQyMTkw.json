Although this course is demanding, you can still get a lot out of this class, as well as all his other classes. He's very accessible to his students and helpful. I would recommend this class to anybody, especially for IT majors since we need this class to graduate.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODA3Nzc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
