I emailed him twice and he only responded once. Another student said he was having problems getting him to respond as well. This class is fairly easy but has a lot of reading. The quizzes and exams are open book and the exams are almost completely the quiz questions. Some of the quizzes are still fairly hard though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODczODQ4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT3123","date_posted":"2020-11-12 21:33:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"This class was made very easy by Professor. He would email us three times a week to remind us of deadlines. All you have to do is dicussions, quizzes, three homeworks, and two test. It was a very easy course; as long as you do everything by their deadlines it is a very easy A. Also you learn a lot from doing the discussions, should take him!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzODA4ODc1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
