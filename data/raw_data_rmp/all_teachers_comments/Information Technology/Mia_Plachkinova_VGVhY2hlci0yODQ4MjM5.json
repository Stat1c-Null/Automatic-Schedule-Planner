The exams and quizzes are open notes, and there is a long semester paper, but she walks you through how to do everything. I recommend attending every lecture if you want to do well in this course.

This is an introductory class, and she has five assignments due on the last day of class. Two of which are huge. One of which is an essay comprised of three 500 word essays that take time to complete. She barely speaks of these throughout the semester, then harshly grades them.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzkyNjU1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Test heavy--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR-3100","date_posted":"2022-11-21 17:03:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a great professor! She is really nice and cares about the students. This course is hard but also very educational. The quizzes have unlimited attempts but are proctored, closed book, and change every attempt. The exams are hard but the questions come from the quizzes. There is 1,500 word essay and a Cisco course due by the end.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODc0MDAx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
