Genuinely cares and wants his students to succeed. He is always available to answer questions, and is quick to respond to emails - even if it's 4am (sorry again, professor)!

He did an amazing job teaching the 4823 course because unlike all the professors here he actually has EXPERIENCE. The course itself is not too bad as it appears that it does at first but go to class and listen to him teach and you will want to go to class all the time trust me.
