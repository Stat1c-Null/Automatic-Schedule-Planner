He explains design terms really well. He is also really good at explaining why certain designs work and how to improve designs.

He's funny and personable, not a strict grader.IAD classes are limited but i advise AGAINST taking ID1 in summer, the work load was crazy. Vis Design 2 one of the easiest classes i took so far.
