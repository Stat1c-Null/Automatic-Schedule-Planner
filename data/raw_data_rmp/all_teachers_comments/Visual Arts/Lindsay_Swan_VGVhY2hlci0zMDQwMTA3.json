The first of two projects took about 40hrs a week for 2.5 months, with unrealistic deadlines. Attendance w/ massive hw was a must, need a big car. She was unprofessional, trying to humiliate/pressure students and fought w other profs. Final was writing 20+ pages.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjE1MjY0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1200","date_posted":"2025-05-08 16:40:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"During the critics, we were supposed to go over vocabulary words that we didn't even discuss in class.

Welp I totally lied. She was nice and funny at the beginning of the semester, but over time I saw her true colors as a professor. Which is UNPROFESSIONAL, PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE, and workload heavy.
