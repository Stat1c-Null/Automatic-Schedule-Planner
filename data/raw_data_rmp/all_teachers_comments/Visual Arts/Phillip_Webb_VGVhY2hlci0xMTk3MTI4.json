He does not post the right information about the art terms and artwork that you need to study for the test. Also, he will the formatting of the test. There is too much information to remember and give you a broad idea of what going to be on the test","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxNzI4MDc1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"D+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART2550","date_posted":"2010-05-25 23:06:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a nice guy, but the class is difficult. All of the projects are very time consuming, and there are a good amount of them. This class will be even more difficult if you don't have the adobe programs, especially as a commuter. He is also nuts about your craft. In the end though, you'll take away a lot of extremely useful information.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjY4MjAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2550","date_posted":"2009-05-10 22:38:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a very busy man and his highly professional, so he has no time for people who do not want to listen to what he says in class. Act interested and be involved if you want a good grade. This class WILL be your most demanding class of the semester, but you will learn sooo much!","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODA3ODU5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2550","date_posted":"2008-12-09 04:03:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's very particular but means well & tries to give as much info. as possible for going into the graphic design business... although he does talk too much at times. Dropped last project/sometimes extends deadlines. He can be boring, but I think it's b/c he is tired (he works a lot). Overall, the projects are really cool and I enjoyed the class!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MTM3ODMz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART2550","date_posted":"2008-11-05 08:53:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall he is a OK guy. At first he kind of expects you to know more than you do about Macs and working with photoshop and illustrator. You don't need a book for the class but he makes you get a subscription to Lynda.com (about $40). if you ask him a question he will answer you but then he keeps going on about things you will have no idea about. he","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTQxMDIz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
