He passes around a sign-in sheet every class. There are only four exams, but there are also about four 1-2 page papers. His tests are 40 question image identifications. He shows the slides, and give you multiple choice answers on which artist produced it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTg2NTgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Lecture heavy--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"ART2850","date_posted":"2018-02-16 13:38:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Sach's tests are needlessly difficult. I like his lectures but his test scores dont accurately reflect what the students have learned. Our class's first test average? 40. He needs more realistic tests for non-art history majors. Unfortunately you'll probably have to take him.. make sure to leave him a bad KSU teacher review. Good luck.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NTcyMDE5","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?

He's very warm and welcoming, and always willing to help if you ask. He has 3 tests, no final, some art events you must attend, and 3 writing assignments. Strongly encouraged to go to lecture. The textbook can be a little disorganized.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NjQwNjE3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ART1107","date_posted":"2013-11-11 16:04:05 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor.
