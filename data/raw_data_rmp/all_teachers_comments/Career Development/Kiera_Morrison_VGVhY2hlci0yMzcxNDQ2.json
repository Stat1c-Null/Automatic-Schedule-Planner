Her knowledge shows through greatly. Readings, lots of writing, discussion posts every week, 3 tests and a paper.

It involves a lot of writing - weekly discussion posts and a final paper - but they're not difficult. If you read the weekly articles you'll do good on the discussions and my final paper was only 3ish pages long and I got a 100. Ended the class with a 98. Easy and fun class with a great professor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMTg0NTA3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS2000","date_posted":"2020-04-16 01:17:10 +0000 UTC","comment":"Really enjoyed Prof. Morrison! She is a great teacher and I enjoyed going to class and learning from her. There was weekly homework assignments, three tests that were too hard, they were open book but the questions where SO confusing, I did much worse than I should have for this class. And a final presentation that is easy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMDY4MzAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Respected--Participation matters","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"LDRS2300","date_posted":"2019-11-15 02:26:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"one assignment every two weeks, quizzes all online at home, super easy.
