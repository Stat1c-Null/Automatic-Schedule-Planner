Mandatory attendance is awful, but not his policy-blame KSU. He's always on time, responsive outside of class and seems to have a genuine heart for teaching &amp; the success of students. First class in continuing ed at KSU. Hope they are all this good.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzM5MjE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
