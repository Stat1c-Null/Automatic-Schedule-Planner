She told us to discuss answers with our partner and then write them down. When she graded them, she accused us of cheating off of each other. And my partner still got a better grade even though she knows I did all the work.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MTUxNjcw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2010-11-19 18:31:46 +0000 UTC","comment":"Poor experience. Instructor was usually unprepared and unclear in directions. Obviously new and did not seem to enjoy teaching or remember the material. Always moody and often rude, jumpy, and spacey. Acted as though her credentials made her better than everyone. She is irritated and impatient answering questions. Stick to your main job.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Nzk0MjQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEML1211","date_posted":"2010-11-19 11:38:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Doesn't know material well. TA does most of the work. Very condescending. Huge ego problem and anger issues, she snaps at people on the daily if you ask something she doesn't immediately know. Passive/aggressive.

However, she's a bit of a feminist and has a pretty big ego, so don't be a dude, and don't try to be smarter than her. Make sure to speak up and KEEP UP. You could definitely do a LOT worse.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Nzc1MTQ5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
