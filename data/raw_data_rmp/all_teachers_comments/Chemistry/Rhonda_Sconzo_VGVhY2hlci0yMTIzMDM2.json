Her tests are hard but they do test  your knowledge. If you don't know something just ask. She is very straightforward. She explains things in a way that make it easy to understand.

Her lectures are very well given and she is always available in her office for extra help. She gave a significant amount of time outside of lecture to help the stragglers get a passing grade.

Attendance with 150 people was annoying and took up too much class time. She talks through exams and quizzes, so bring ear plugs.

She made chemistry much easier for me and the entire class to understand! She would stay as late as you needed her if you had questions or didn't understand something. She would demonstrate the lab for the evening and then turn you loose with you partner.

She really cares about her students and wants you to pass. Must go to class! Must do labs before class not during!

Prelab quizzes, lab notebooks, lab reports, and final exam. Pay attention to math in individual labs bc it is on final.

She knows her stuff and is willing to help anyone. She does require a little more than other lab instructors, but it pays off in the end.
