He does quizzes everyday you attend class. Tests are not weighted as heavy as homework and classwork. So if you are not a good test taker, take him. Passed with a B even though I failed like 3 tests. Does give extra credit at the end. He is a little rude at times and expects you to remember everything","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMzYzODY5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Skip class?

However, the quizzes are easy, ONLY IF YOU PAY ATTENTION during pre-lab lecture the previous weeks. Very lax personality yet professional. Tough grader but his rubrics for papers are clear on what he wants to see. You may need to do some self-research/studying though. But its ochem, only a handful of profs that can teach it well.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzMjMxOTQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He gives incorrect answers all the time, which makes it really hard to learn. He is not approachable and will not answer questions that are asked, and he will act like you are stupid. He literally has no idea what he's doing. Unnecessarily hard quizzes every class and the final is all free response.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTEzNzYz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
