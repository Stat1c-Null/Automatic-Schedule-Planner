His lectures don't help since he teaches like you should already know what he's talking about. That being said, he curves heavily! Took in the summer and there's a quiz everyday over 1 chapter of the textbook. He drops the lowest quiz and test. He curves the final too. Would take with someone else though.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMzgyMDgz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Clear grading criteria--TEST HEAVY","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM3361","date_posted":"2018-04-09 10:30:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is somewhat difficult, but if you study properly you will feel ready for exams. For CHEM3361 (aka organic chem 1), the class had 11 quizzes, 3 hourly exams, and a final. He drops your lowest quiz and lowest hourly exam! He also curves. In one exam, I made a 67 and it turned into a B. He answers questions over email very clearly and promptly.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NzY1NTM0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Skip class?

Exam averages are usually low but he understands it's a difficult course and very difficult exams and he curves accordingly.

This is a really hard class and it requires a lot of studying. He has 11 or so quizzes and are not bad at all if you read the chapters. He is a very funny, quirky, interesting guy.

You need the book!  He had chapter quizzes, and he cares about the side stories in the book. His tests are half multiple choice and the other half is short answers or drawings. This class took most of my summer. You have to read, practice, repeat. Do the practice problems and exams. Ask him questions to clarify.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODUxMDk2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM1152","date_posted":"2016-07-30 11:00:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took Organic Chem for the summer. Haseltine is very intelligent & teaches you to think critically.  I had to fully dedicate myself and only earned a B. Haseltine has a different way of calculating grades. He scales grades based on the class average. If it weren't for that I probably would have failed even with 30+ hours of studying in the library.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODQ3MTc1","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"1152","date_posted":"2015-07-24 22:58:22 +0000 UTC","comment":" Hardest class of the prerequisites. The material is tough and there is a lot of it! Reading quizzes daily, 3 tests, drops lowest, and a final. Exams are MC and short answer and are laid out just like his practice exams.
