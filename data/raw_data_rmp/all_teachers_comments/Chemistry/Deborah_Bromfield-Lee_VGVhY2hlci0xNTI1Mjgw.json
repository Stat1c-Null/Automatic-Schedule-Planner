She made my life miserable for the semester that I had her.  She will make you hate chemistry, science, and life.  She has little concern for how you're doing in the class and replies to your constructive comments with more homework, longer labs and harder tests. Absolutely horrible.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzIyMDk2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212","date_posted":"2012-09-16 15:04:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Ok, first of all Chemistry is not an easy course, if you are wanting easy classes then leave the college of Science. This professor is very helpful offer TONS of extra credit and is very willing to help you. ALEKS takes a lot of time, but will help SAVE your grade. ALEKS brings PRACTICE.

Great part is she gives tons of extra credit which you should do. She gives surveys which drop a hwk grade if you do them.
