She responds to emails and texts so quickly, is so good at explaining hard concepts, and gives us every opportunity to pass (extra credit). She posts recordings of the class and all notes and extra practice. Bless this woman. Take this class please! It's hard but she makes it worth it.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MTk3NjY3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Caring--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true}]
