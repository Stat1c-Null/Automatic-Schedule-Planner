His lectures were fine but spent 2 hrs lecturing & only 1 hr for the actual lab. I didn't like his personality either. Acted condescending & if u make 1 mistake in lab (like forgetting to put on your googles) he gets pretty upset.

He refuses to let anyone stay after class to finish their work, he's even ended class 30+ minutes early on multiple occasions.

Before every class take a 10 question quiz over the lab and write a bunch of things that you don't even need in your journal. Also will get angry if you write work on the left side of your journal instead of the right. pretty good lecture wise. grading is strict.
