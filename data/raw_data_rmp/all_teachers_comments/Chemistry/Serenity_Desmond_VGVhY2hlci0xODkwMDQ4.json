Be sure to come in prepared because she gets right to business. She's amendable to anything you might need, so don't be afraid to ask her things! Very nice and most approachable professor I had last semester.

If you need help just ask and she's there. She loves what she does and will talk to you about anything you want. She knows her stuff. If I could take her for another class I would in a heartbeat.
