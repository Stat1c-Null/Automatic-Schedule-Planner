He expects you know what's going on before you even walk through the doors. I only went to three classes before I dropped him. First day, we took a quiz right after he went over the syllabus so pay attention. Good luck with this one.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNDIyMDkz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Group projects--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
