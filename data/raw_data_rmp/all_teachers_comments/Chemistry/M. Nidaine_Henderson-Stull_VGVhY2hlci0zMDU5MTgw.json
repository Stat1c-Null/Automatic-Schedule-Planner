Be prepared that all of her quizzes will be open late, as homework assignments are due on Aleks. She is highly disorganized and unfamiliar with D2L. She is a friendly and very nice person, but it won't help you.

Everyone saying she is disorganized does not account for all she has been going through. She really does want students to succeed and will pass you with an A in lab or lecture f you just work hard and go to office hours. Chem 1 and 2 are hard and having a down to earth professor makes it a lot more comfortable!

She was so forgetful&disorganized. The class constantly had to remind her to open up our homework and to upload the slides she uses in class. We were constantly 2 weeks behind all the other CHEM 1211 classes.

I also turned in my hw on time. She offers helpful extra credit and allows the opportunity to replace all your exam scores with the final if you made higher in that section. Class not that hard.

These ratings seem harsh, likely from students who skipped class or ignored resources. She's a bit disorganized, but will ensure your success. Offers EC + final exam policy that replaces all unit test grades. Attend class, study her notes, go to office hours, and you'll do fine.
