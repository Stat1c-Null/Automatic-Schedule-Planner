Also, this was her first college teaching job and it seems she did not like it very much. She even had a copy of a negotiation letter for a high school teaching job she had just been hired for attached to the last study guide, so her focus was not on us :(","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3Mjk4MjY0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2010-04-27 09:33:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Talk about the most amazing teacher, she really inspired me to work hard and learn more about chemistry.
