Gives a lot of extra credit. I should have failed this course (my average was in the 50's) but I did a lot of EC & met with her outside of class & got a C. Make your own study guides from the book, tests are VERY HARD.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MzIwNjU5","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2010-05-09 17:24:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is a doll! it was her first year so she didnt know. But she will try everything to give you a good grade. I was behind in chem lab..like 3 or 4 chapers and i ended up making a C in chem lab, but I made a B in her class.

Very helpful to the students, but need to ask. Tried very hard to make sure the students got best grade possible, dropped lowest 2 quiz scores, lowest test score. Adjusted grading policy from beginning of semester to do so.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTMwMTUy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2010-04-26 06:08:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Like stated, very sweet lady. However, her tests are unfair. Its so much broader than what she teaches. She does give a lot of extra credit and will throw in a curve sometimes.

I try, I study, and I read and it still doesn't seem to work. She is very unclear and she teaches things that she isn't sure of, and a lot of the time she is very wrong. She is messy and disorganized and I'm waiting for missing grades to show up. Students correct her on her notes, not a good sign.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTg3Mjc3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2010-04-07 20:23:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Sweet lady, not meant to be a teacher though. Organic Chemistry is hard enough as it is, and she makes it difficult to understand. She means well but confuses herself and gets caught up and is easy to misunderstand. Sit in the front and PAY ATTENTION. Use the book to help you, you're going to need it.

This is her first year teaching as she used to be a chemist. Unfortunately, there were a lot of whiners in class and people who didn't read the book and wanted their hand held the whole class, which slowed the class way down for the rest of us. Read the book, do the homework, and come to class it's an easy A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2OTE0MzY5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2010-02-19 21:34:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I really like her as a teacher.
