Attendance is not needed, as he teaches directly from the powerpoints. This is a great teacher to take if you simply need a passing grade. However, if you're a science major I recommend another teacher. I passed, but took little away from the class.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NTgyODg4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212","date_posted":"2009-11-30 14:01:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"This Prof is such a good-hearted, easy-going person! He wants you to do well and enjoy the class. Extra points are available on every test, he only curved one test but it was a worthwhile curve! As long as you study his reviews and the problems we do in class, put forth some effort to really learn, you can make an A.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2NDM5MzU1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM3110","date_posted":"2009-01-05 15:06:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"he is nice person.  he understands if you can't make it to class.  i took him at 8 a.m and half the class was never there.  he gives big curve and test are not bad if you study his ppt and review.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzE5MTM2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2008-11-06 21:14:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had him for 1211 and 1212. He's a very nice guy and is head of the chemistry department. He tends to curve ALOT! A day before his exams he goes over a past exam with us so we know what to expect, which was probably the most helpful thing. He's always making jokes and then laughing at them, which in turn made me laugh. :-)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE0OTUxODc0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
