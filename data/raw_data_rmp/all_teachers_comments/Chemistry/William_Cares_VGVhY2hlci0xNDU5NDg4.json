When asked questions he confused us more by giving more info than needed.  Would probably be great for a higher level class, but for an intro class gives too much info.  He is willing to help and he does want you to do well, but I basically had to teach myself.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MTk5MDAz","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2014-12-11 13:24:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Definitely not the easiest professor out there, but he's very easy to work with and willing to help.  His tests DO go up in difficulty as the semester goes on, so he's not kidding when he says to not fall into a false sense of security.  Even though the homework isn't grade it, DO IT and ask LOTS of questions and he'll help you out.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0MDM1MTgx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Rather not say","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1201","date_posted":"2014-08-18 00:06:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Cares' class is not easy by any means.  If you stay for recitation, he will help with the mandatory homework (easy grade) and any calcs/formulas that you are having difficulty with.  I found that if you follow his lecture with your lecture notes (sent prior to class), let him talk during class.  Stay during the recitation to ask questions.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTM2NTIz","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1101","date_posted":"2012-10-23 16:49:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Over qualified for chem 1101. lots of homework.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwNzI4OTQw","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2012-05-30 12:04:52 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR CHEM 1211K (Principles of Chemistry I).

Very monotone. Puts everyone to sleep. Try and pay attention and take good notes. Tests are fair but kinda hard. Do the optional hw and you'll be fine. Read the book if you need help.
