Shes really strict with attendance, having the right notebook, and wearing the right stuff (will kick you out), but she makes her expectations very clear in the beginning. Its a chem class so youll have to work hard regardless of the professor. She cares.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzE5ODA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Skip class?

This is because she gave A LOT of extra credit and we had one project which helped too. She loves to also see effort being put in. She brings in donuts sometimes too. :)","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwNTYyMDgy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Gives good feedback--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1211L","date_posted":"2016-11-06 19:14:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"She's a perfectionist who takes this class way too seriously. EXTREMELY HARD GRADER. You will lose points for having a word on your report in pencil. Or for a missing sig fig. BUT she's nice, and very smart. She explains things on the board before each experiment. But this class took up WAY too much of my time, and was just unnecessarily hard.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MTM4MzQx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Respected--Skip class?
