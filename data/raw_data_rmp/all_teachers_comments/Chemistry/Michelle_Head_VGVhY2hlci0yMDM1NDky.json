Your syllabus is your best friend!!! Her hours are flexible and she will stop at nothing to make sure that all of her students pass her class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzExOTM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2015-09-18 23:15:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"She had us watch videos at home and do worksheets in class(flip model classroom) Class was chaotic and difficult to concentrate on any work tests were 20 questions so you can only miss 2 questions to get an A. LOTS of homework required. She has u take ridiculous Quizzes b4 every class and at the beginning of each class. Barely teaches.
