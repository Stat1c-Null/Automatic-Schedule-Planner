Was always in a good mood, cared for students. She wasn't too proud to laugh at her own mistakes or entertain simple questions. My only complaint is that I won't get to take another one of her classes again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDE0MzY4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM3501","date_posted":"2015-12-09 14:25:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice professor. Her class becomes pretty boring IMO but fair and easy grading. Only annoying part of testing is that she often includes questions on small less important details that you wouldn't think you'd need to memorize. More memory and regurgitation than application of concepts.

Not challenging enough b/c we didn't read many research papers. Dr. Moomaw speaks very slowly, which I found distracting. The lab was easy b/c she gave us all the instructions like feeding babies. She is moody and doesn't have a warm personality.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjYyNDIz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM4500","date_posted":"2013-03-20 13:32:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"This course is very challenging, the analysis of scientific journals is really stretching my ability to comprehend scientific literature. Working in the lab to plan out experiments  helps to expand my ability to work in the lab and expect certain results.

Very good at explaining biochemical concepts at the molecular level. Fair grading system.

She's transparent on memorization and fair with quizzes and exams. Practice q/e for every quiz/exam! Drops one of each--powerpoints ARE lectures.

She really cares about the material and she was always helpful and willing to offer her time if you needed additional help. She was very fair with grading and gave ample opportunities to perform well.

Dr. Moomaw made many attempts to understand you how you perceived the material and went the extra step to help you learn in multiple facets.

She makes mistakes teaching all the time, and in lab she is more useless than a TA. We get NO clear instructions... no intro. to using EXCEL.No expl. prior to starting, and there's too many assignments due. Her grading is SO arbitrary. Just because you have a degree in the field doesnt mean your can be a teacher.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3NjE2NTky","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
