If you need to understand the concepts, just ask her and she will make it clear. Grades fairly and gives you plenty of chances help your own grade. Chemistry is never an easy course, but she's as good as it gets.

Very clear and extremely helpful. She has a sense of humor which makes the class much more fun. She gives you practice exams the class before an exam and lets you work on it in groups and she takes the exams straight from them. No homework unless you need help. I learned so much from her.
