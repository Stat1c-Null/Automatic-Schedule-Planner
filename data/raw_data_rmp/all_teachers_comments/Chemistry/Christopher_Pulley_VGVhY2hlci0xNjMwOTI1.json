Got all easy As in his class. Just read the chapters before you go to class and you will not fail to get an A. I wonder how some of these students expected him to teach&#63; His tests were very easy. Take him for sure!If you want free points. He gave all of us an extra free 17points on the final so everyone made their grade.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5NTY3NTM4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2011-11-15 11:35:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Frustrating. As a person, I like him. As a teacher&#63; Wish I'd had someone else. 1st semester teaching. Had a lot of material to cover, but his attitude was &quot;if it doesn't apply to nursing, I'm not covering it&quot;. With a state-standardized chem final, I certainly don't get to pick what questions I answer - why does he get to pick what to teach&#63;","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MjQxMDgw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2011-11-14 19:55:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great class & I liked him a lot!

This was his first semester here as a teacher so he got mixed up at times but he always had an answer for questions asked. Read the chapter prior to going to class and you will be just fine.

He needs to get a little more experience behind him. Be prepared to go home and teach yourself basicly.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE5MTcwMjg0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
