Expects you to have Chapters 1-3 read before the 1st day of class. Does a really good curve on tests bc everyone ends up failing them. Only have 5 tests in the class and he does not prepare you for the final. Drop this class and find another professor because he is no help!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNjUzMDU2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212LAB","date_posted":"2013-04-07 00:39:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Thankfully I only have him for lab. Pay attention to what he says and writes otherwise he'll look at you stupid if you ask. He changes the procedures often and will go by his own grading and not ones listed on lab report (if he feels like something is worth more, than its weighed more). Condescending at times. Rushes you out of lab. Overall he's ok","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDk2MDQ3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2013-04-05 13:16:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"Avoid him at all costs! He expects you to already know chemistry. His lectures are confusing and not helpful at all.

He is confusing, and doesnt help much. He will take ALL of lecture time to do 3 problems. Id rather read my book. Drops the lowest test grade. 10 homeworks, 4 tests, 1 final. Very hard. 20 question multiple choice","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDg0NTk1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1211","date_posted":"2013-03-25 16:57:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very rude and doesnt answer questions without catching an attitude. His tests are from the test bank in the book.  The tests are easier than expected but have a lot of calculations and he cuts the class short (which makes no sense). He is not the best teacher, but if you find a good SI leader or study group you should do well. He drops lowest test","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIxNDQ1OTgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212LAB","date_posted":"2013-03-18 11:23:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"Horrible professor.

We took our 2nd test on Feb 28. The last day to withdraw without penalty was March 13. He waited until the night of March 12 to post test grades. He never responded to my emails asking whether I had a chance of passing and he wasn't in his office to talk to.

I have always been a good student. I got a 4.0 my first semester. Then I took his class and you literally have to teach yourself everything.

I had his 50 minute class he would spend most of the time talking about other things that didn't have to to with the chapter. You have to teach yourself everything in the class because if not you will fail. He only gives you 50 minutes for the tests that are 20 questions each all calculations.
