It isn't impossible to make an A but she makes you work for it. Her grading system seems somewhat arbitrary and her quizzes and tests are hard to prepare for, so the class can be frustrating.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMwMTI1MDQ3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LECTURE HEAVY","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM1211L","date_posted":"2018-01-03 22:11:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had her for Chemistry I Lab. She spends the first thirty minutes of the lab class reviewing last weeks lab and going through the lab you would be working that day. She writes useful notes on the board to help with the lab reports. She drops one lab grade and offered to redo failed lab reports. Overall, good professor and would take again.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Mzg0MDY1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Would take again","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM3362L","date_posted":"2017-12-09 02:30:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. O's pre-lab lectures are insanely time consuming and boring. She sounds unconfident while reading off a power point. She's a lot more lenient grader than the other organic lab professors in my opinion. Her quizzes and final are a little bit difficult since they ask for a lot of details about the labs. Make sure you know the reactions.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTA2MzA5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM3361L","date_posted":"2017-05-09 20:57:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Probably the worst professor I've ever had at KSU. Hoping she gets fired before anyone else has to suffer her lab. Dr. O just grades however she feels. We have compiled tons of papers from students in her class wit the same answers but different grades. She has no understanding on the labs and you will have no idea how to write the reports","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjY1NzYw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"3362L","date_posted":"2017-04-19 10:08:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is ridiculous when it comes to grading.

Let's you leave early after you finish your procedures. Caring and lets you redo labs if they are not good grades. She drops one lowest lab. I only made a B because I did not study for the final which is 50+ question multiple choice. I would retake her for another chem lab if I could.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Nzc3MDgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?
