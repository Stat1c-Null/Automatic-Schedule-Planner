Her labs were so incredibly easy, and she would explain concepts better then my chem lecture teacher would. After her instructions, we would get out of lab like 50 minutes tops. She has an accent, but you don't even notice it anymore after the first two labs. Take her!!! My favorite lab so far.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDk0NjYy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Caring--Respected","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2025-04-17 01:26:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"Teaches very well, stays on the same problems for a very long time. Sometimes she gives different due dates than what's on D2L, but you can always submit worksheets online. Very good at answering questions and doesn't make it intimidating to ask them.

She teaches the knowledge required to understand what you are actually doing, further building on what is taught in regular lecture. She answers emails right away (I've had full convos w her in one day), has available office hours & accepts late work to encourage learning. Accent is NOT THAT BAD!

Advertised due dates are misaligned with real due dates, some being from up to two years ago. One section said \"Section 14, due Dec 1 2023\", but it's spring of 2024. You have to dig for information.

She gives several lab reports you have to do unlike other sections. She also isn't the most clear with procedures and makes class sometimes confusing. The only good part about her class is that she will write important stuff on the board you can copy down. Also she is not a light grader.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjQ2NjY4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM3362L","date_posted":"2023-05-22 16:18:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. K is the best! Will help you during lab, and will do hard things like NMR analysis and mechanisms for you to copy into your notebook! She's also very sweet. Definitely the best ochem lab professor there is for both 1 and 2. My only critique is that she starts grading submissions at the very end of the semester which can be frustrating.

Dr. Sudeera is a great professor and knows her stuff. She has an accent but is always ready to help if you're stuck and is very patient. She goes thru the lab before we start it.

Pretty lenient grader although she would dock points for random things here and there. She can be unclear about the lab procedure so make sure you ask the lab assistant for help because they seem to know more about the lab than she does. Overall, solid choice for lab.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NzUzMTgx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Participation matters--Skip class?
