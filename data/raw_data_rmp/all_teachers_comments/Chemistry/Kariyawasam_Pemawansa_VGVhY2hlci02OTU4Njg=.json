I'm serious, do NOT take this professor, especially not online. He does not work with students, or answer questions. He is horrific.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTk3ODc1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2010-05-08 15:08:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"I actually took his Chem 1151 class online at Georgia Perimeter College. He literally did not teach us one thing. We had to use the mastering chemistry site and textbook to teach ourselves. Unfortunately, he does not use these sources when making tests. Also, he will not give any guidelines for studying for the final.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTUyOTc2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2009-05-14 17:07:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is a fair teacher and corrects mistakes on quizzes and test. Corrections usually benefit the student.  Tests are not too difficult and mostly multiple choice. Do not take notes!! He is not the best teacher but does know the subject. Just read i-college lecture notes. Study on your own and work as many problems as one can find!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODM5MTA5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2009-04-29 09:03:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very difficult to understand accent.

He can't speak english too well and attendance isnt mandatory. Quizzes are online, there are 3 tests and one final.  ALLLL are OPEN BOOK.

You cannot understand a WORD that he says and so it is difficult to learn anything. The quizzes and exams are not THAT hard, but it is not worth it.
