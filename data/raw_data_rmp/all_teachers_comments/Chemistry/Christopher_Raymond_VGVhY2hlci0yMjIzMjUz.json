Really chill, basically does the entire lab in front of you and shows you how to do the calculations. Super lenient grader but attendance is mandatory. If you need help either he or the TA will help you out. Definitely take if you can.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTcxOTIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Group projects--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212L","date_posted":"2017-12-18 12:37:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Raymond wants all of his lab students to succeed. He takes just enough time at the beginning of class to explain the lab and answer questions, but leaves enough time where you will most likely get out early almost every lab. I took the 8 pm lab and even that was made bearable with this professor, getting out at 10:45 sometimes. Highly recommend.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MjU3MDg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211L","date_posted":"2017-12-10 01:23:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a great professor. He explains the lab of how to do it and gives you the calculations for them. If you have questions, ask him and he will answer them. There are quizzes to complete before lab and the answers for them can be found on Quizlet. You also have to do a sds and chem notebook along with a final. Pay attention and you will be fine.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTE0ODUz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1211L","date_posted":"2017-12-08 22:33:44 +0000 UTC","comment":"This is the best Lab professor KSU has, he is not a tough grader at all. If you do the lab correctly you'll get an A on the lab report! He is VERY understanding and want you to do your best! ABSOLUTELY the best lab professor and I am very upset he is not teaching Chem 1212L","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MTA0NDIw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
