But speeds through chapters and examples she provides. Extra credit is available but you must go to 10 SI sessions just to receive only TEN points on hw (you must go to all 30 to get 30 extra points). A quiz is due after every chapter, will deduct if no work shown.

If you don't want to go to class, you can still do well by self teaching, doing homework and quizzes. Don't slack though. Tests are difficult for the average KSU student.
