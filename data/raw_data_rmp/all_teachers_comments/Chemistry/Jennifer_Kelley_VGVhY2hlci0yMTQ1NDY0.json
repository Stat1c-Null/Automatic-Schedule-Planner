She is very helpful and basically dumbs things down if you do not understand something. She also gives extra credit for each test you take and it helps a lot.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDMyMTQz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211L","date_posted":"2016-09-01 13:06:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"I had her for lab, but I heard she's teaching lecture! You guys are SO lucky. She was such a great lab instructor. Very easy grader, and you could tell she was happy to be there and help you out. She was pretty funny, and made Saturday lab  a pleasure to attend. I can't recommend her enough.

Not a tough grader at all, and is SO helpful. I wish she taught lecture, because she's that awesome! Her pre-lab lectures are very concise, and at times are more informative than the actual lectures I heard in class. Put in the work (not much) and you WILL make an A!!!!!","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NjM3MDQ5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1211L","date_posted":"2016-05-16 21:13:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best lab instructor EVER! She is probably the nicest science teacher at KSU. I took her for saturday lab, and I would do it again, even at 8 AM! Very easy grader, so if you show up, do the lab, and actually try, you WILL make an A! I look back fondly on this class since I'm taking upper levels now. Without a doubt the best lab I've ever had.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2NTkxOTc0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
