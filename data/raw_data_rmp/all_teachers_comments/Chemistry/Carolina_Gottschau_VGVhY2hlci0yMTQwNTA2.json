She explains important chemistry concepts before each lab to ensure everyone is on the same page. Herself and her lab TAs were always happy to help and offer assistance on the lab. Highly recommended.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5OTg2NzA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Very approachable and helpful; willing to walk through problems with you if you're struggling to understand something. Labs and reports are straightforward, though they do take a notable amount of prep work. Best lab instructor I've had.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5Njg4ODQ0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211L","date_posted":"2018-01-25 14:12:34 +0000 UTC","comment":"Explains things very well and helps with the lecture too.
