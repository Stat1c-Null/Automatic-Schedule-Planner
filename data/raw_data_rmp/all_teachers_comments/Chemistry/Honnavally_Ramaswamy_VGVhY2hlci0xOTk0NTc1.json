He does his best to explain the lab prior to starting it, and he is happy to answer any questions you have before/during the lab. He likes students who show interest in the subject and make an effort in the lab. I felt very prepared for the final exam.

He has a strong accent, but once you get used to it it is easy to overlook. His lectures before the labs can get a little confusing, but he gives most of the answers. Grades pretty easy and is an overall great guy.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNzQ3Njkz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1121L","date_posted":"2020-03-06 02:02:06 +0000 UTC","comment":"In this class, I learned very little, as his lectures are vague and the assignments are convoluted. I got an A in this course through learning it all for myself. The final exam is standardized and his lectures do not prepare you for it. He won't really help you understand the material, since if you ask for help he just does it for you.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTU1NDQ2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

I managed to get an A in Chem 1212 Lecture. However, I received a B in the Lab. His lectures are long and disordered. The lab reports always took WAY long then they should have because his lectures are so confusing. As a hard-working student, please, choose someone else.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNzIyNzE0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Test heavy--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM1121L","date_posted":"2018-04-18 20:02:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Rama is a really funny guy.

I couldn't understand half of what he said and he couldn't solve the problems he put up on the board. He cannot use a computer well and won't upload grades. I had no idea what my grade was the entire semester. He randomly changes due dates for homework without telling the class.

He'll confuse the whole class and keep going.  He assumes that if one person answers correctly then the whole class understands it. Lots of online hw and most of the assignments he gives out are harder versions of hw.
