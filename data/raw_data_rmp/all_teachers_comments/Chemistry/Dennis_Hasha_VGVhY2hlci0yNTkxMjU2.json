I had to go to his office hours twice a week, every week because he wasn't really helpful over email and he is a tough grader. he's nice, but he tends to over explain things, so I wouldn't recommend.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMTYxMzY2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212L","date_posted":"2024-08-29 22:36:22 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great experience with his class. He's very friendly and approachable. Checks on students during experiments and is happy to answer questions. Lectures at beginning of lab are long but very helpful/informational. Seems like a hard grader at first, but once you understand his expectations it is not hard to do well. Definitely recommend taking him!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5NzE1Mjg2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Caring","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212L","date_posted":"2024-05-16 00:28:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Hasha lectures for 1-2 hrs before lab, the lectures are difficult to learn from & it was frustrating. But then, whenever I needed help, he never hesitated to help me, he's understanding & genuinely wants students to get the content. If you want a professor who cares about you, he's will, and is lenient with you if you show that you are trying.

He grades so harshly. I accidently put a negative in one of my equations and he took off 20 points. He wouldn't let me redo them either. Most people in this class either got a 60 or a 100 on the lab reports, no in between.

Lectures at the beginning of class can be mind numbing for non stem kids. Lab report grades are stricter than 1211 but really help you learn. Very accessible and helpful.

He gives a lecture at the beginning of lab going over the topic but this lecture can take up half of the lab time so don't schedule a class right after the lab is supposed to end because you will most likely be staying late to finish the lab. He is a nice man who is looking for social interaction.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3Nzg2NjIy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lecture heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212L","date_posted":"2022-12-04 21:34:55 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pre-lab quizzes have 3 attempts no lockdown & no post-lab quizzes. You turn in your lab reports at the beginning of every class and he only grades the purpose+procedures in your lab notebook. He's extremely understanding if you're late to the lab or do not have your report with you. At the beginning of every lab, he goes over procedures too.

LabFlow is what makes it hard. He does a powerpoint before the activity each lab so that we understand what we're doing and what our data will mean.
