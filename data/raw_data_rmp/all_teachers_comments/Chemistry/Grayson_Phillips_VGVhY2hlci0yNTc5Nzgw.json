He grades specifically to a key, so you often times lose out on a good chunk of points. He is a nice guy, but I don't necessarily think he's the best option out there.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTg5ODYy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Lots of homework--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false}]
