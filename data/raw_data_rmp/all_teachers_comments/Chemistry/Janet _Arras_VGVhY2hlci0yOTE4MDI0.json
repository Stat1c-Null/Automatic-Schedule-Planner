She wasn't familiar with the material at all and couldn't answer any questions asked. We turned in the lab reports at the beginning of next weeks lab as usual but final grades were due today and many students still do not have grades in.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMjYwMjcw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Incomplete","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1211-L","date_posted":"2024-12-10 07:44:27 +0000 UTC","comment":"Janet is an absolute sweetie! dropped my lowest lab nd gave me a good grade! She puts in grades late but you will do great just go to every lab and finish everything you are assigned.

While it can be hard for her to communicate with her due to her accent, she is very understanding. I wouldn't recommend for a first option because I feel like I could have learned a lot more. If you are a pro at chemistry and don't need help, she goes through things swiftly and you just mix chemicals","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5MjYwMDQ0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Participation matters--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1211-L","date_posted":"2023-12-11 20:54:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor was super nervous and not very confident with labs throughout the semester.
