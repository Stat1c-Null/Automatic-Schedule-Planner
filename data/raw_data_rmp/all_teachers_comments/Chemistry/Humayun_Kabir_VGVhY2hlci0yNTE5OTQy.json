While earning A's in other difficult classes, I had a C this entire course until the end when he curved the final. No matter how much effort I put into the assignments, nothing was good enough to get above a C. If you have a question, good luck getting a helpful answer.

After talking with other students taking 1211L with different professors, it appears that the class itself wasn't hard- just this professor. He never told us how to prepare for the final at all. His responses to emails are extremely vague and never help. Quite rude responses.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NjU3MDY1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

First of all, he is not specific on grading criteria for the lab reports. He just marks off randomly on your papers with his red pen accompanied by a few remarks in his illegible handwriting. He does NOT tell you how to improve or what was done incorrectly. He barely explains the labs, but still talks A LOT.

While Dr. Kabir is knowledgeable, he is a tough professor. Lab reports should be impeccable to even earn the chance at obtaining an A.

His grading is very difficult. He's a nice guy and funny. You will have fun in his class, but you will spend hours on labs to get good grades.
