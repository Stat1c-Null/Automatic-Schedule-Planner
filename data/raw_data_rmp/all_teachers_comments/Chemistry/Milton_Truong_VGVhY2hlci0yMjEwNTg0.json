He wants all of his students to succeed, so he is not as harsh of a grader as the other nitpicky lab teachers. He's all about learning, not punishment for making a minor error.

Take no one but Truong if you want to learn and enjoy chemistry.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5ODg2MDY3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1211L","date_posted":"2018-01-24 10:13:47 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best lab professor I ever had, he is really funny and is not a tough grader.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NDk2NzE4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

So many others grade the notebook and lab reports so closely and one mistake could cost you big time. But Milton is super laid back and forgiving in his grading. Easy to talk to when you have questions and explained concepts before each lab better than my lecture professor did.
