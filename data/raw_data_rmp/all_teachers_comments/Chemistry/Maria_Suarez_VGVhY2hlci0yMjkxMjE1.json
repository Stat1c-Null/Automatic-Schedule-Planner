However, it was her first semester so it came with challenges. We did not have a clear grading rubric or feedback until we were 3 months deep into the semester. She gives quizzes that are open book and final Is open book, so just prepare well for each lab. Prelab lectures take a very long time.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4OTk3Nzky","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
