Chemistry's always been my strong suit, though, if you're not a chemistry savvy like me, keep track and lock in the concepts from the get-go to be successful in this course. Abbot is there to help, more importantly, she is more than capable of helping.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MzQ2MTkx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Inspirational","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2023-07-24 03:00:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"I love this professor!

Her lectures are crucial to attend and although she doesn't take attendance, your test grades will reflect on how dedicated you are to succeeding. If you put in the work and attempt all of the things she recommends, then this class will be an easy A or B.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3OTA4MTkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Caring--Lecture heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2023-05-11 00:57:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Chemistry is an extremely difficult subject.

Final can replace 80% of your grade, other 20% is mainly completion-work. Drops 3 activities per unit (4 units total), so you can fail every single quiz and it not affect your grade. Read the textbook and turn your notes in on time. Study hard. She preps you for the ACS final well, but you have to work for it.
