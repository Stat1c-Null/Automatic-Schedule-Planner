Also, for the content assessments, if your lecture professor doesn't assign readings, make sure to use google because he assumes that you're being assigned readings and they don't go along with the lab.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDQxOTYy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151L","date_posted":"2015-12-08 11:14:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very helpful during labs, but unclear in his instruction. He also didn't know when our final was or what it was over, so he was unprepared and we had no idea what to study for. Also, don't expect your content assessments to be graded in a timely manner. Nice guy, though.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1NTg2NzM0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151","date_posted":"2015-12-07 15:55:18 +0000 UTC","comment":"Best lab teacher!!!

I had him for Chem Lab and he was always super helpful when performing the experiments and filling out the lab report. He is also fun to chat with while working. This class is an simple/easy A as long as you follow the procedures and remember to do the assessments on D2L.
