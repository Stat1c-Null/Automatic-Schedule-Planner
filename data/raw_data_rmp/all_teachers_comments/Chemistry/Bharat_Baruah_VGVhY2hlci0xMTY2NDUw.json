Accent isn't bad at all compared to some. His tests are very predictable, and he does not try to trick you. Not much text review was needed, but it doesn't hurt to brush up on some of the more difficult topics. 1212 is a pretty dense section of chemistry, so be prepared for it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Nzk3Njcy","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212","date_posted":"2009-05-08 11:07:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"So nice!I was in his office almost everyday which is how i did well on the tests.he gave practice test that are like the test.if you understood the concepts you will do well on the test.he just turns the question around.he will not help you alot on the homework because its graded.he says that is not fair.he has an accent but you get use to it.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1Nzk0NDMx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212","date_posted":"2009-04-29 11:07:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is an extremely nice man but his class is not so great. He tries to explain and uses powerpoint but he gets confused sometimes and if you're anything like I am that will completely throw you off.

Keeps and honors his office hours. Not the easiest accent to understand but he is comprehensible. I am taking him now for Chem 1212 and I recommend him. Teaches at a reasonable pace.

The only reason he isn't a 5 on difficulty is because he posts a practice test on Web CT, and if you complete it, you will be pleasantly familiar with the exam. They're not the same questions; he changes the numbers or wording, mixes formulas, asks for a different variable, etc. Don't bother going to his office for extra help.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MzQ3MzU1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2009-01-02 21:17:37 +0000 UTC","comment":"I was not expecting Chemistry to be very easy, but I was not expecting it to be very hard either.
