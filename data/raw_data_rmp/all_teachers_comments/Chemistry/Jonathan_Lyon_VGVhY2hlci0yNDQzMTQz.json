A third of my class dropped within the first 3 weeks. Our TA knew nothing, I learned more from another student taking the course. His grading of lab reports is also all over the place and not very consistent","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTQwNjA4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

Gen Chem 2 is hard but he makes it easy. He always curve the exams. Homeworks are easy and only 8-10 question each and good chunk of the grade. Quizes are similar to his PP examples. I would take it again. ACS exam is a hell tho so make sure you complete homeworks and quizes to gurantee at least B","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMxOTg2OTM2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":2,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Graded by few things--Clear grading criteria--EXTRA CREDIT","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
