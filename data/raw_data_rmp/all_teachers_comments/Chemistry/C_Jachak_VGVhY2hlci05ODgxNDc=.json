He is very helpful and if you ask him a question about the lab he usually will tell you the answer or do it for you.  He is nice and jokes with the class.  He can be hard to understand with his accent, sometimes, but for the most part I had no trouble.  I would definitely recommend him!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1MTkyMTgx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHLAB1151","date_posted":"2008-12-12 15:23:19 +0000 UTC","comment":"Mr. Jachak is very helpful and a great lab teacher.
