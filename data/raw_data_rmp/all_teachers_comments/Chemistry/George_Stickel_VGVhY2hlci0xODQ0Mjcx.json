He can have some ADHD moments, but it's not bad. He is very passionate about making sure his students succeed. 10/10 would recommend.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDcwNDk5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Respected--Inspirational","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"STS1101","date_posted":"2016-10-25 19:15:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"He's a really nice professor.  You can tell that he cares about each student. Still, there's a LOT of reading; at least one chapter of each of the three books per week. He also demands long papers that require much time and thought, but he does give good feedback. But you will get a good grade if you participate and do well on the other two things.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDc4MDk4","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--SO MANY PAPERS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211L","date_posted":"2013-12-16 15:50:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awesome professor!
