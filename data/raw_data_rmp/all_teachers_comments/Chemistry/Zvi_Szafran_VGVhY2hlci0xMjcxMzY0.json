If you attend class, take notes and pay attention, ask questions when you need to, you will do fine. He makes some odd analogies, but they always help.  He cares about his students success, so if you try he'll help you!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MjY0NzQ4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212","date_posted":"2009-04-13 14:33:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"One of the best professors I have ever had.  Makes it easy to pay attention in class.  Obviously loves what he does and knows his discipline inside and out. Prepares students well for exams with valid practice exams.  Gives mandatory homework but grades by effort so its an easy A to factor with your exam grades.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1NjQyNzI3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
