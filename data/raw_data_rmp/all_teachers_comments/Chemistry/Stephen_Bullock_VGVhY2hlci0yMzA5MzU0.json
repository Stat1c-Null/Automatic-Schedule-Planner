On every test/quiz, there were several instances of the questions being VERY unclear. He's a nice person, but when you have to curve every test by 20+ points, there's something wrong with your teaching style.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDg4NjIz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM1151LAB","date_posted":"2017-12-05 00:59:43 +0000 UTC","comment":"Pretty laid back guy and was so so nice!

He pushed class back 30 minutes because he couldn't get there on time, then he would still show up late up to 25 minutes after the already pushed back time. Despite pushing back the start time he would rush you to still finish the lab by the original end time. Doesn't explain lab. Doesn't answer ?s DO NOT TAKE.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5MDA3MTk3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
