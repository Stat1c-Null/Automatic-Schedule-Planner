She'll help you in the lab if you have questions but she was a very tough grader to me. Ex. she deducted 50 pts from my assignment because a tiny bit of her signature was cut off in the pic I had to submit. I worked really hard in this class and usually get A's but since chem isn't my strong suit I got a B.
