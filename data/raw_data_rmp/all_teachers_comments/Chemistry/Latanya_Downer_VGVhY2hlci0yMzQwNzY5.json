She will mark you wrong for anything she can, and does not give half credit. She also tends to work problems out wrong, or tell you the wrong answer in class, but still mark you wrong on your paper for her mistake. She has disliked me since day 1 because I often ask questions in class and annoy her.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NjAxNzU0","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
