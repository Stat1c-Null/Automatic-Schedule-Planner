He is so helpful and wants everyone to do well. The class was not stressful at all, and he made sure to let us know exactly what was going to be on each quiz.

I knew that if I knew that if i needed help, or if I had a question, he could and would answer it for me. He hasn't really figured out everything in the lab yet, but he knows the way the science works and is ready to teach it. Take this guy, you won't regret it.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwOTY4MjA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"L1212","date_posted":"2012-12-04 08:57:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Murphy is THE MOST AWESOME lab professor there is at KSU.
