She doesn't go into detail on a lot of the subject matter - tests were more concept-based than calculations.  Gives out tons of slides and goes over exactly which ones are going to be on the exams.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0ODYzNDEy","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212","date_posted":"2015-05-05 18:57:07 +0000 UTC","comment":"Fairly nice person, but only scratches the surface of the course material, leaving you to learn the rest on your own.  Will give you every chance possible to get an A if you show up.  Accent is subtle and not a problem, but her explanations of course content are poor.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzQ3Mzc3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212K","date_posted":"2015-04-22 18:47:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"If you're just looking to pass, she's the one for you. But if you actually want to learn, avoid at all costs. Labs are hardly ever graded for accuracy and it left me totally unprepared for the lab practical.

Tests are very similar to the powerpoints, that she gives you by the way. She hands out a ton of paper, which includes powerpoints, study questions and answers, and homework. For homework she gives you about 15  questions, but you only have to do a few of the problems. Overall a really easy class.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzOTU1NDEx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true}]
