Sometimes what he taught was different than what my lab prof taught. He explained more of the \"what\" and not the \"why\" or \"how\" which made it hard to apply information. He uses smart works which is great, but did not set it up to communicate with d2l. I missed many assignments which dropped me a letter grade. These make up 20pts/100pts total.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMDc5NjI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"D","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Lots of homework--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":null,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM3601","date_posted":"2025-03-18 16:17:23 +0000 UTC","comment":"P-chem is a complex course, and I understand his difficulties of teaching it to an extent.
