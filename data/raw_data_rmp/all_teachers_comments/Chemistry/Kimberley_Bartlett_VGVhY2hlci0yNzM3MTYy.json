I recommend only taking her if necessary! Her labs were ahead of the actual chemistry class I was taking, so she tried to teach it to us for 30 mins. Keyword TRIED!! We were told to do pre-calculations for a topic we haven't even learned yet. She also never showed us how or what to do! Super frustrating!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1MjM4NzI4","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Skip class?
