Homework is sometimes a bit too much on MasteringChem. Some days you'll have 28 questions, other days 48.  I recommend reading the book before class. Gives extra credit quizzes for those who regularly attend class. Super nice, just don't  get on her bad side.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjE1NDA5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"C+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1212L","date_posted":"2016-03-31 09:29:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"i could never understand what she was saying half of the time. don't be late to her class.  you have 3 minutes to get to lab after class starts. if you come 4 or 5 minutes late she will tell you to leave. she is very helpful if you ask for help and sometimes she even show you how to do it. take advantage of her office hour.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjA5MjAy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2016-03-08 09:37:45 +0000 UTC","comment":"New prof. She has accent that is a bit difficult to understand. She flies through notes like nobody's business, but she does post them on D2L. Occasional math mistakes; watch her work in case. Overall it's OKAY, but not anything great. Same grading as other Chem 1 classes at KSU, same testing, same extra credit policy.
