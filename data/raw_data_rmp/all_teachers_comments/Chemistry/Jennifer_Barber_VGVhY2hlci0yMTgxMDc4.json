It is the middle of the year & we only have 4 lab reports graded out of 9. Hard to contact outside of class. Explains procedure well before we start the lab. After asking a bunch of questions she does get annoyed.

Besides that she is a very nice person, reminds me of Bailey from Grey's Anatomy. If you do not attended the labs, you will 100% fail. There is a decent amount of homework and a harsh no late work policy.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM1NjU1OTQx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

You have to buy the manual but barely use it. Her grading is ridiculous, she'll count everything wrong if there is a tiny error. She is weeks behind on grading, she acts bothered when you ask questions, and considers pretty much everything to be cheating. She is a nice person though.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3MDc5OTM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":6,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--LOTS OF HOMEWORK","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
