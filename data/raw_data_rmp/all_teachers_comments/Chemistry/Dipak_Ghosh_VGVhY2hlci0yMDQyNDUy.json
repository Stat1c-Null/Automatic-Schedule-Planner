He'd then degrade and yell too. He's quite lazy, which came in handy because he would give us As on labs he doesn't even take up. However, he would give 90s, which meant you needed to get a 90 on the final to make an A. I'm pretty sure he curved it.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI5NzQxNTkz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CHEM1152L","date_posted":"2017-12-19 12:27:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor Ghosh is really nice, however he can be hard to understand.

However its a lot o independent work. Show up, do you lab, when you're done leave finish the lab and bring it to the next class. If you want an A in the class just do the work and read prelab. Only down side to the professor is that you can't understand him at all because of his accent, but if you read before you're fine","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjczOTA2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1152L","date_posted":"2017-01-13 10:36:50 +0000 UTC","comment":"You can barely understand him when he talks, he has a thick and fast Indian accent. He barely explains the lecture portion and barely helps with the lab part. He wouldn't let us stay the whole class to finish our lab notebook and ask him questions- he made us leave as soon as we finished the lab. everyone failed his quizzes so he gave us 100s","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NzI2NTg0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Skip class?

He is hard to understand but you can follow him by what he writes on the board. He is very lenient. All but two people failed one quiz, so he dropped it. He is really nice and willing to help.

He is hard to understand, and the lab assistant is the one actually explaining stuff and helping.
