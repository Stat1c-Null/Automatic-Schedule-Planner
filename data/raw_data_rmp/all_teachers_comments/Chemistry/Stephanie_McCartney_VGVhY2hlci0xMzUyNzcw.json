The class dropped from 60 to 30 students. The class test averages on the first two test were below 60%. I made a C but only because I did well on the last two tests and made a C on the final exam. I worked harder for that C than for almost any class I've ever taken. She has to cover LOTS of material in the course.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NzY3MzM5","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212","date_posted":"2011-05-07 13:58:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Her first lecture ever, so she has a lot of room to improve. 4 of the 6 tests including the final had a class average of an F.

Nothing was ever done to actually help us for class. She is not fair, quizzes would always be what you would have as questions after the lectures. WHAT GOOD DOES IT HELP TO GIVE A QUIZ OVER IT! Dropped from an A to a B cause of her.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4MzUwMjg0","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":1,"would_take_again":true}]
