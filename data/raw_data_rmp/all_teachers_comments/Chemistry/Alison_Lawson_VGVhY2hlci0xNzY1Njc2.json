Knows what she's talking about! Lectures are very helpful! She doesn't check attendance but try not to miss class because chemistry is a hard subject and you can fall behind.READ READ READ the assigned chapters and do ALL of the assigned problems in the back of the chapters. She gives you a practice test which helps as well. Awesome!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODc0NzAw","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"BIOL1152","date_posted":"2012-11-12 23:46:35 +0000 UTC","comment":"Nice teacher.  Gives 4 test with the lowest score dropped and a final.  Discussion board posts are easy points and pop quizzes are challenging if you haven't practiced the material from the class before. I'd recommend her for the first chemistry.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIwODIxODg5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
