However, she has a very thick accent which may be difficult for some people. She grades fair and makes sure you understand where you missed points on the lab. 1212 Lab is a lot longer and harder than 1211 and she made it the adjustment easier.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTcyMDIw","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1212L","date_posted":"2014-01-23 15:00:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Serbanescu is amazing! She is understanding and lenient and makes everything crystal clear. I would take her for every class if I could. The final is hard, but it's standardized, so it isn't her fault. But she curves.

She grades almost too easily, so I highly recommend her if your chemistry is not too strong and you need a good grade.
