He encourages going to his office hours and is very helpful during them/during class. Take advantage of those and class time to ensure good grades on your report or you'll be stressing towards the end of the semester. Drops two quizzes and one lab.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3NDI1MzA5","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
