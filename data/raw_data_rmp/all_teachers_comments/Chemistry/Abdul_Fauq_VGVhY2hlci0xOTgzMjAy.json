He knows what he's talking about, but doesn't know how to get that information to the students. Test 30 minutes, 25 questions, continues lecture after tests. Pulls questions straight from homework and quizzes, so easy to study those answers, but you won't retain anything from the course. Do not take.

Really tough class because there's so much information that you have to know. He is willing to help if you ask, but you really need to work hard in order to get a decent grade.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NzEwMzU3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1152","date_posted":"2015-04-10 23:57:29 +0000 UTC","comment":"Awful teacher. Started crying in class after test because it was so hard and he didnt teach us any of it. You can't understand him. First test was 30 questions long and he made us do it in 30 minutes, with short answer. Please, do not take this class. He teaches right after quizzes and tests. There's no homework and no extra credit. Good luck!","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NTc3Nzgz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1212L","date_posted":"2015-04-08 16:58:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took this lab and it was terrible. He would randomly take off points and couldn't explain why he took off the points. My lab partner and I could have the same answers and he would take points off from one person but not the other. If you ask why you lost points he would threaten your grade and would not explain why you lost points. Do not take.

He does not take questions or even give time to ask questions. His tests and quizzes are difficult. After several complaints, he decided to drop the lowest test grade and add some bonus points on the quizzes. He wants to help but doesn't know how to teach.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI0NDI2MDIz","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
