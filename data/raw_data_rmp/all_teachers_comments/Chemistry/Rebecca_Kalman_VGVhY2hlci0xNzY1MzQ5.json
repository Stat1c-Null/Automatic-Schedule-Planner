Her lectures are decent but they aren''t reliable.  She is a little scatter brained and rushes through material. Home as a whole is worth a test grade so do it right Study guides are somewhat helpful too.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNTk2NDA2","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2014-04-29 22:43:42 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Kalman's great. Very helpful, takes questions and will answer emails fairly promptly. She offers 4 tests, lowest one dropped, online HW and final both worth 20%. Be sure to do the HW and to read the book for tests and you'll do great.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMTI3MTk2","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2014-04-15 19:08:51 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very kind and sweet teacher. She wants students to strive and shows dedication to that. Four tests, lowest test is dropped automatically, final, and online homework worth 20% each. Lectures feel rushed, but are very fun and informative. Tests are NOT that difficult, JUST READ THE BOOK and you'll do really well. Great teacher! Highly recommend!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDQzNDgw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1211","date_posted":"2014-04-08 18:53:16 +0000 UTC","comment":"Truth is this was a really hard class. I thought Dr. Kalman was sweet however her she rushes through the material all the time often leaving the class confused. She will very often skip steps in math equations so be sure to tell her to go back over it. Her tests are also hard as well. She's not bad but shes definitely not good either.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMDA4MDc4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM1151L","date_posted":"2014-03-28 23:42:01 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very sweet lady.

Take her during the semester if you want to hurry up and get it over with.  An A is very possible if you study for final and do well on lab assessments and online work.

Quizzes are difficult but are all online and aren't a huge part of your grade. Labs were every other week, and she was very specific when grading lab reports - she's so smart.

She is very kind & understanding- always willing to help.  The lab reports can be challenging and the WSA quizzes aren't easy, but, with some effort on your part you can make an A.

Spends a lot of time before lab going over the procedures. Is willing to help, responds to email very quickly. Grades lab reports tough, so I recommend asking questions and working with a group and you'll get an A, no problem.
