She doesn't just give you the answers, she allow you to figure the problem out with her guidance. She know that her accent is hard for some to understand so she repeats what she says multiple times so everyone can understand.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2Njk3NDk0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CHEM 1151 LAB","date_posted":"2015-10-24 18:32:00 +0000 UTC","comment":"Would not recommend at all. I had her for lab only (made a B in lecture with another professor) and she was very rude and short when I asked her questions. She would \"review\" our lab notebooks before we turned them in and had us fix some things but then when she went to grade them she would count off on stuff she told us was right.

Lectures are hard to follow because of language barrier. Extremely tough grader and takes off for small errors on labs. BEWARE of signficant figures. Definitely the worst professor I had this semester, simply because of the way she grades and the language barrier.

Doesn't correlate with the Lecture Prof's to parallel our labs with our lectures and what we're learning and what we're not. DO HOURS OF WORK and you'll walk with a C. IT IS WHAT IT IS.

My only issue is my chem lecture (w differ teacher) didn't keep up w lab, so its harder to do well in lab; had to study extra hard for online wksheets in lab. pay attention to sigfigs in lab, units rounding usually 0.0 or 0.5","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNjQ0OTg4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":3,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"1151L","date_posted":"2014-10-08 22:44:26 +0000 UTC","comment":"She comes across really nice and easy at first, and she is nice, but she's confusing and grades pretty tough.
