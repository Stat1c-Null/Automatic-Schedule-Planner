I had a hard time understanding his explanations, as he did not provide much lab lecture. He expects you to know the material from lecture, in order to complete the lab. He offered extra credit during the Summer and did not curve final.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4NTcwNjY3","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Skip class?

Generally, a nice guy, but does not grade easily on lab manuals compared to other lab professors. Make sure you setup your lab book right and # pages or else your grade will drop.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDY3OTc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"B-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
