He is strict and does not review for his midterm and final but this will make you a better student. He is not the easiest professor but he is funny and makes his class enjoyable. He grades things quickly(I knew my final grade the next day after my final) and he emails quickly as well.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE4NTY1MDQ2","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":2,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISASYS","date_posted":"2010-05-06 14:15:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"Professor green is a really good person and most of the time is easy to talk to. He does seem sarcastic and intimidating if you don't know much about it, BUT if you talk to him, he'll give you advice on how to gain an edge. He did randomly give us pop quizzes though; not in the syllabus and our final was 61 questions, nonmulti choice & only 40 mins","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE3MTM3MzQ4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":3,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISA3200","date_posted":"2009-12-13 22:42:20 +0000 UTC","comment":"I took him for two classes this semester. Both classes he did the exact same crap. I could go to one class and skip the other for that week. He read his lectures word for word from powerpoints, at times he didn't seem to know anything about the material, and sometimes he did.

I'll be the first to admit, it's a difficult one.  But that's not what we're here to do.  As a teacher he is knowledgeable with industry relevant experience.  He might be an acquired taste, but as far as competency and ability goes, he is perfectly able.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE2MDk3NDQ1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"ISA2100","date_posted":"2009-05-19 15:15:49 +0000 UTC","comment":"This guy was a great instructor!  He's been in the industry for years, and talked frequently about his experiences with clients.  This helped me tie together the theory with the reality.

He does take an interest in reinforcing real world business skills(business writing and speaking)and does not tolerate 1/2 assed work.
