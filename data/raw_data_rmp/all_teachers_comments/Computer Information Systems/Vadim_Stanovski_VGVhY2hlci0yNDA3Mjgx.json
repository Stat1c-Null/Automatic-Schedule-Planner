Dude will take off 60 whole points off assignments without giving feedback. He will give you 40 links and expect you to have memorized info. Probably the worst professor at KSU, and I had a good amount of bad ones (trust me).

You'll basically just be teaching yourself through google and vendor documentation. He doesn't respond timely to emails or posts from students with questions, and when he does he is flippant and condescending. He does know the subject, but not how to teach.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MjIyODM1","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"So many papers--Tough grader","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IT6863","date_posted":"2020-12-15 04:39:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very crazy professor. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR. He doesn't explain anything , he just gives material. He doesn't care about the student. He has a thick accent and cant speak English fluently.

Doesn't respond fast enough for an online class. Labs had some handson but I still felt clueless. Not enough hands on for me. 50/50 of class grade is assigns/test 1 &amp; 2.

He is so unhelpful, his grading criteria is unclear and then he takes off points if you miss something he was unclear on. I had to hire a tutor and no matter how much I demonstrated that I wanted to do well in his class, he did not care.

They are done through a copy-paste method so keeping it clean is a bit difficult.
