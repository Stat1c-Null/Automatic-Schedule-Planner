She does call on people in class so pay attention! Shes really nice unless she notices that you dont pay attention and cant answer any of the questions she asks you. 90% of the time she will let out early! Tests are very simple. Just make sure you study the powerpoint slides!","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTEzNjAxOTQ2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CSIS3210","date_posted":"2007-10-31 10:21:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"Very enjoyable professor, has helped me overall in college more than any other as far as my greater concern.

Has real world working knowledge and is PMI certified.
