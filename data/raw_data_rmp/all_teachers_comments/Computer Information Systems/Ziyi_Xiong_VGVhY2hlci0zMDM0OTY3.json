There is a group project, but it was broken up into 3 parts, making it easier to manage. There were also quizzes, discussions, and a midterm and final. I don't normally participate, but I felt comfortable participating in this class.

There are 65+ questions on each test and there are 5 of them and they take up majority of the grade. Soooo much study material it's impossible to get through all of this.

However... This courseload was too much, two projects, including a group project, five closed note exams, including the final exam and 5 iseng. This may seem easy but studying for those exams took so much out of me.This felt more like a capstone class. Beware.

Response times were slow, class was disorganized, & we received the group project guidelines a week before it was due. Gave us no instructions or guidance to complete access assignments. Took forever to grade as well. Needs a lot of work.

She slow with replies, but is considerate. One or two mid terms and final. Both worth 15% each of your grade. Project and Quizzes matter most though. Be prepared to actually go through the slides when preparing tests. The study guide is useful.

Slow to communicate, confusing d2l layout, constantly changing deadlines, removing and adding graded assignments, forcing Microsoft Teams for presentation, the assignments she did have often barely worked, etc. I do not recommend taking her.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5OTc4MTA3","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
