I and most of the students actually felt bad for her. As a person she will forever have my respect. She was a great and caring woman. She has a lot to work with on regards to teaching but I feel like once she gets the hang of it she will do awesome.

I completely bombed a project and she let me come in and helped me through it and I got an A on it. She gives lots of extra credit. I only went to the first class and still made an A.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2MzMwNzg0","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"EXTRA CREDIT--Group projects--Lots of homework","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"Is2200","date_posted":"2022-05-05 04:00:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"The worst professor I have ever taken. I wish there was a 0 rating on here because thats what I would give her. I did all of the work myself and taught myself thats why I got such a good grade. She was very lenient with grading because she was new and so bad at it. She even admitted how bad she was. I would highly recommend not taking this woman.
