The class is a high-level overview of different technology infrastructure aspects. There are several guest speakers who delve deeper into the topics. The lectures are straight to the point and then there are a few writing assignments and quizzes.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwMDY0MTg0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Caring--Graded by few things","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"3040","date_posted":"2024-10-23 02:28:03 +0000 UTC","comment":"Speaking for her online 3040 class.
