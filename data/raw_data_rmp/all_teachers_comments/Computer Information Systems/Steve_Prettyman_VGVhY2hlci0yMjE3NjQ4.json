Mistakes? Don't make them. You could tell him you lost both limbs in a car wreck and he wouldn't give any slack. This class is a self teaching class with little-to-no guidance.

Encourages questions but responses can be vague and seem impatient. Instructions also tend to be vague but forces self-learning - I learned a lot by myself. Textbook's free online, but you'll have to find the weekly reading yourself based off the lecture. Weekly quiz, 4 labs, 3 papers, midterm, and final project (no final).","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDg0MDkx","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Group projects","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"IT4423","date_posted":"2020-12-14 15:30:30 +0000 UTC","comment":"I signed up for another prof but KSU decided to switch professors on us.

To pass his class, simply memorize the whole book,  Exams are Very hard, you can score 100% on all Quizzes and Labs, but still fail the class.
