Not very responsive to email, but I took him over the summer so your mileage may vary.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4MTE5MDE1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Lots of homework--So many papers","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT4323","date_posted":"2022-11-13 02:47:13 +0000 UTC","comment":"Interesting course and it covers about what you'd expect. A lot of the material seems to be a couple of years outdated though. Other than that it's not too bad of a class and kinda interesting.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2ODIyMjIx","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT4323","date_posted":"2017-05-06 17:47:54 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall, Professor Leverenz's class was about as typical as an online class is. Expect to rely on yourself for learning the material, and expect to have generic assignments and tests. The weekly discussion can be fun, but it can also be a pain. Do what is asked of you and you'll be fine, but expect there to be challenges here and there.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MjMzNDI4","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Get ready to read--GROUP PROJECTS","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
