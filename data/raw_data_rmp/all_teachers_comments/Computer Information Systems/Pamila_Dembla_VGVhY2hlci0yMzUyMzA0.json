She is MIA... never responds to her emails or discussion board and gives assignments with unclear instructions. Furthermore, she offers no notes, PPTs, or teachings of her own. There was no direct textbook access. Dr. Dembla is simply at KSU for a paycheck.

I don't know why all the reviews says she's bad, she was just fine. She responded to emails, was available for meetings, and gave overall good feedback. The course was pretty much one of those online textbook courses (kinda like one of those Mcgraw Hill courses). Group project was okay. Easy A overall.
