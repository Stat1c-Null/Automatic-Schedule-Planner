He is terrible at communicating with his students and takes off points on Labs for using concepts you have previously been taught. Overall, I made an A due to having great assistance. Only take him if he is the last case scenario","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3OTgzMzE1","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1113","date_posted":"2023-05-03 13:39:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! I had some programming background going into this class, but without that, I would have failed this class. You are expected to teach yourself with pretty much no help. Instructions are unclear and he takes off points for things he did not specify in the instructions. My whole class this semester was completely lost...","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3ODAzNDgx","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Get ready to read--Graded by few things","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1113","date_posted":"2023-04-26 20:44:08 +0000 UTC","comment":"This man does not teach. Be ready to teach yourself the material and possibly him on how to communicate better. YouTube and tutors will be your best friend for this course unfortunately.

Penalizes you for having prior knowledge of programming + using it. Gives insufficient feedback. Link to Pycharm was incorrect + redirected to a pornographic cam girl site. Penalizes you for using concepts that ARE TAUGHT. He doesnt teach so he doesnt remember what was covered and what wasnt. No accountability.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NzA2MzQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"IT1113","date_posted":"2023-02-02 20:03:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Took his class online, found out his textbook is actually a powerpoint, no lectures, told us in an email we must spend 10 hrs per week learning the material by ourselves.

The class is pretty difficult, but that comes along with taking a senior level class. There is a midterm, final, and about 6 labs in total, so if you bomb one, it will be really hard to make your grade back up. Professor provides plenty of information (video lectures, ppts, etc) to ensure you know the information.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTM1MjYx","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Participation matters--Clear grading criteria","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true}]
