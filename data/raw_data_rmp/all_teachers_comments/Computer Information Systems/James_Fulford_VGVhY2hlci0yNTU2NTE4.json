It's March 26th and the professor has yet to instruct us. Like we don't even have a professor. We are given one powerpoint per module, that doesn't even contain quiz questions. We must then take the lockdown quiz as our only form of practice. Then exams with webcam. I would give a 0 if possible.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0NDc3NDYy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Graded by few things--Test heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false},{"class":"CYBR3300","date_posted":"2020-12-18 16:35:02 +0000 UTC","comment":"Prof. Fulford is supportive and encourages questions, but his answers are vague and unhelpful. Doesn't post rubrics and is a tough project grader (Hint: ISSP  BYOD). Weekly quizzes (Lockdown browser) are randomly specific and are harder to study for than the midterm/final (MC and LockDown cam). Tough class but it's 3000-level.

If so, this professor is for you. Projects There are vague and contradicting instructions on an extremely heavy term project (plan 40ish hours). Even though the instructions are extremely confusing, he grades incredibly harsh and expects extremely specific things. Feedback is generic and non-helpful.

None of the learning material comes from this professor just a book, audio lectures, and slides he didnt make, so wtf is he being paid to do.
