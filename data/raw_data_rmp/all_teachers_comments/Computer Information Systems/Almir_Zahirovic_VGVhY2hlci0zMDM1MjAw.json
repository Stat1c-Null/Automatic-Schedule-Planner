He is extremely passive aggressive and borderline rude to students who email him respectfully with questions. Frankly, I think he should find another profession if he has such an issue with teaching 300+ students, as that is what a professor does. 0/5 stars.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxNjI5MjQw","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR4423","date_posted":"2025-05-09 13:50:58 +0000 UTC","comment":"Overall this class is pretty straight forward and if you pay attention and follow the directions and due dates you will do great. He does come off a little strict, only because people don't follow directions and ask questions that were explained. He is very fast to respond to emails and help with issues that arise throughout the semester!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQxMjI1MTEy","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough grader--Clear grading criteria--Gives good feedback","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"CYBR4423","date_posted":"2025-05-03 02:38:48 +0000 UTC","comment":"12 Quiz, 12 Labs, 2 Big Discussions posts, Midterm, and final. Rocky start with miscommunication about how the labs should be submitted so PAY ATTENTION to LAB FORMATTING or you will get a zero with no questions asked.

He had some attitude while emailing and ignored my emails. I had to submit an appeal to the  chair and dean office to be heard and approved. Very bad attitude for a new professor.

He does a great job at communicating. His class is setup really well in terms of due dates and if any changes happen he will make sure you know. If you take his class be ready to do lots of labs that do a great job at teaching you Linux. Main issue I have is his discussions are not setup well it is confusing.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM5ODA5ODI1","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Lots of homework--Respected","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
