On 1 ppt alone we had 54 boxes/tables/pages we had to look up, that's not including the other material. This was for 1 lecture. She gave us a 3 pg study guide for test. Then comes in after test and says, \"Well I guess you know that was a FYI study guide.\" None of it was on the test. You cannot follow her lectures.
