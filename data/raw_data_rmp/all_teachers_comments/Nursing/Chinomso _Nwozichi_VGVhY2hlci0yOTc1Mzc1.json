It's no surprise that the material is challenging&#8212;it's a nursing course, after all. While Dr. Chino does have an accent, he makes an effort to clarify his points and often uses hand gestures to help, like giving a thumbs-up when something is increasing and a thumbs-down when it's decreasing.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTkwMDU1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Participation matters--Gives good feedback--Inspirational","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3304","date_posted":"2025-04-15 02:43:14 +0000 UTC","comment":"pick anyone else","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwOTQxMDc3","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read--Test heavy","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3304","date_posted":"2025-03-19 18:58:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"He will only read directly from the PowerPoint during lectures and cannot answer anyone's questions. His accent makes it very hard to follow what he is saying. He is very slow, often taking the entire class to finish reading half of the PowerPoint and rushing through the remainder in the last 20 minutes. Tests are horribly written. AVOID.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTQwNzkwMjg4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Get ready to read","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3304","date_posted":"2024-01-01 12:52:11 +0000 UTC","comment":"He is very approachable ","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4ODE2MTQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Beware of pop quizzes--Caring","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
