She is not easily persuaded. What she deems is correct typically stands. Case studies are over what is presented in class. I failed most but still earned a 94%. ATI quizzes prepare you for proctored ATI which is heavily weighted. Test questions were fair and straightforward.

Tests are weird because its only 50 questions with over a 1,000 facts to remember. Sometimes questions are asked based on what the professor knows, not what we were taught.

Passionate about nursing, tons of experience as both a RN and a teacher. However, her stories can take up quite a bit of time and seem to be more for her ego vs our education (and don't always sound true). GO TO CLASS. She leaves stuff out of ppt on purpose for skippers and will NOT post later. Overall would take again.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njc1ODc0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"A-","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Skip class?
