Given the circumstances of the lecture being online and the lab being in person, she did the best she could. This was by far my favorite class and I couldn't have done it without the help of Dr. White for both lecture and lab. TRY TO TAKE HER CLASS! You will not regret It.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM0MDU5MTEz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":true,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Accessible outside class--Amazing lectures","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
