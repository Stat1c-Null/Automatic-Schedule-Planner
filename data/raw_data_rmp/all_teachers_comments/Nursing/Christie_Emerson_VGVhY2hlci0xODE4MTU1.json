We only had group discussions in each class, two papers, and two presentations. She is also very nice and approachable for issues and questions.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyNTk3Mzkw","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Graded by few things--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3209","date_posted":"2014-05-27 14:54:53 +0000 UTC","comment":"Holistic nursing was a difficult class mostly taught with powerpoints, which I didn't like. However, professor Emerson made everything seem so simple, which boosted my confidence. I really wish that she taught every class and that I could just follow her around for clinicals.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzMzE3MzE2","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"N","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true}]
