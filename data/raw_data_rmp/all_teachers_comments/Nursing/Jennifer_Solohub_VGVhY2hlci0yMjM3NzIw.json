Instead, she copy's the book and then pastes it on a PowerPoint. She reads the PowerPoint word for word in class. When you don't succeed on the test, and you go to the test review, she just tells you that it was in the book. So, basically, she expects you to know everything out of the book.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3OTAzMTgy","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Not sure yet","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Tough Grader--Get ready to read","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":false}]
