Yeah she teaches differently than Dr. Davis but that's the point. We have two different professors so we have two different perspectives. I like it when she tells stories about her experiences bc it helps apply material. She's a nice lady !","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTIzNDQxMjI0","clarity_rating":3,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":2,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"4990","date_posted":"2013-07-12 18:31:15 +0000 UTC","comment":"You have got to be kidding me. Do NOT take her! I took 4990 PNI in the summer and it was the worst decision to take it with her. She asks for SO MUCH, and its just an elective class! She cant be serious!? Never again!! 10 quizzes, 4 exams, 1 lab report 1 group prez... Wish I dropped the class when I had the chance!
