Tests are vague, and poorly written. Class discussion is encouraged, but if you have a differing opinion she gets offended easily. A large amount of guest speakers that are their to fill their own course requirements.

It's the only way people actually show up. Does not put notes up until right before class. Test are too vague. Very nice but not very helpful or decisive.
