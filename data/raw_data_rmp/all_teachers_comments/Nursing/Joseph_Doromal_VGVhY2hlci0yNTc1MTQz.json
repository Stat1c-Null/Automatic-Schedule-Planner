Since this is a hard course, I would strongly recommend attending class since they give out tips for studying. Flashcards, mnemonics, and active recall helped me go from barely passing to A's on exams.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM4OTM4NDA1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Amazing lectures --Lecture heavy","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3303","date_posted":"2023-04-29 04:11:21 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Doromal is a great professor.

Pharmacology is not an easy class, however he is always there to answer questions. There is a ton of material to learn so don't get behind. They do give extra credit assignments at the beginning of the semester. It isn't much but every little bit helps. He is very understanding & does his best to accommodate everyone.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM2NTUwOTA4","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Hilarious--Test heavy--Accessible outside class","textbook_use":3,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"PHARM","date_posted":"2021-10-29 02:55:09 +0000 UTC","comment":"Amazing!

I had him for Health Assessment and Pharmacology and he is a great professor. He's super knowledgable of the material and also makes class fun. He really wants to get to know his students and will do his best to help them if they're struggling. I wish he taught every nursing class.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMzNDI2MDM1","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Skip class?

The class is extremely difficult, but he does his best to make it fun and easy. He tends to repeat things that will be in the test. He makes up sayings and acronyms to help you learn. He is extremely caring and wants everyone to succeed. Record his lectures and read the book and youll be fine.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTMyOTMzNjIz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"B","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Clear grading criteria--Lecture heavy","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true}]
