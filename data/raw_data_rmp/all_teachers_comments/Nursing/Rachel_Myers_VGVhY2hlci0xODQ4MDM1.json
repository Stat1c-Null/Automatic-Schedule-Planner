You're going to be a nurse, you need to commit to showing up. Dr. Myers CARES so much about her students, and her lectures allow you to really talk about your nursing and life experiences. Very interactive. Her tests and assignments are easy if you show up, read and care.","difficulty_rating":2,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2ODA3ODA0","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":1,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3209","date_posted":"2016-04-27 14:45:17 +0000 UTC","comment":"Cares a lot for students! Charismatic and nice. She will keep you there the whole class time which kind of sucks, but so does being a nursing major. It's not her job to let us out early, her job is to teach us. Our job is to learn. Do your job, you'll get an A. Great professor. Get used to long lectures b/c that's how the whole nursing program is.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2Mzk0MDgz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3302","date_posted":"2016-03-30 15:19:39 +0000 UTC","comment":"just no. no don't do it.","difficulty_rating":5,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MjA0ODU2","clarity_rating":1,"student_grade":"Drop/Withdrawal","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":7,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3302","date_posted":"2013-11-06 00:13:56 +0000 UTC","comment":"Dr. Myers is very nice and knowledgeable!
