I had one bad test for this class and I went to talk to her about it and she was so nice, and reassuring. Assessment is one of the most important classes. It's good that it's difficult. Dr. Maguire will help you become a great nurse.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI4MDUxODA5","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Caring","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3309","date_posted":"2016-02-11 12:39:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"Great professor and great class.  First semester of nursing is tough, and this class was no exception, but this was my favorite class of the semester.   You learn a lot of info and get a lot of hands-on practice.  Go to class prepared and you'll be fine.  Maguire always graded fairly and explained anything I missed on an assignment or demo.","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI2MDQ4NjIx","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3309","date_posted":"2016-01-03 15:24:33 +0000 UTC","comment":"She will challenge you, but in the end, you will know the material. Uses online materials from book publisher which I used to study and made high B's on each test. Lots of demonstrations/practicals.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1ODY1MDAz","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":5,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3309","date_posted":"2015-11-02 11:21:38 +0000 UTC","comment":"She is extremely nitpicky in her grading of assignments. Will deduct points for things that were not listed as grading criteria on the rubric. Does not clearly explain assignments, and if you email her to ask questions, her responses are just as vague. She teaches alongside Ms. Wheeler, and they give conflicting information when asked questions.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI1MzIzNTE4","clarity_rating":2,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":5,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true}]
