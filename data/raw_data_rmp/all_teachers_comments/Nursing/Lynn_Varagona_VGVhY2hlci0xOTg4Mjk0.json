If you show up, you'll probably get an A, however the lectures are long and BORING. the class is almost 3 hours for NO reason. you don't even need to take notes on the content so it's basically pointless but you have to go to get the attendance points. take it online if you can!!!!

We only got 3 pages of paper and a group project this semester. PowerPoint project is easy. Also, she doesn't take attendance but she releases the class activity at the end of class. That is literally the attendance and the assignment. There is a free textbook on the internet so you don't need to buy the textbook either.","difficulty_rating":1,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTM3NTExODMz","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"Inspirational--Hilarious--Caring","textbook_use":-1,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3314","date_posted":"2017-01-05 03:11:36 +0000 UTC","comment":"By far my favorite prof so far in the program. She truly cares about her students and wants all students to do well. She will put in extra work and listen to student feedback, she'll do whatever she can to make things better for us. In an incredibly stressful program, that's pretty cool. Also teaches clinical at Grady, HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!","difficulty_rating":3,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTI3Njc1ODQ3","clarity_rating":5,"student_grade":"A+","is_for_credit":true,"attendance_status":"non mandatory","is_online":false,"comment_likes":0,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS--Clear grading criteria--Caring","textbook_use":0,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NURS3314","date_posted":"2015-03-02 22:51:31 +0000 UTC","comment":"Hands down, the best instructor I ever had.
