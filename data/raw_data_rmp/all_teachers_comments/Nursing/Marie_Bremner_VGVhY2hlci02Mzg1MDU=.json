DR.BREMNER is AWESOME. Very intelligent. All you have to do is show that you are genuinely concerned with something she will help.She is talking about.

After taking it, I think Dr. Bremner is a great lecturer and prof.  Sure the nursing exams are hard, you have to learn how to think like a nurse!  She helps you do that.  Don't be afraid of Bremner, she really is a great instructor. Lee's (assist) lectures, however I would skip.","difficulty_rating":4,"teacher_id":"UmF0aW5nLTE1ODQ0NTM3","clarity_rating":4,"student_grade":"","is_for_credit":false,"attendance_status":"","is_online":false,"comment_likes":1,"comment_dislikes":0,"rating_tags":"","textbook_use":4,"would_take_again":true},{"class":"NUR3209","date_posted":"2007-06-15 22:32:04 +0000 UTC","comment":"OK Dr bremner is very experianced teacher. she knows what she is taking about. when she talk about some of her experiances don't underestimate them or don't say why she is talking about her story, trust me she know what she is doing.  those story will help you for the exam.

Pompous, insecure, and not very helpful at all.  I made a high B and felt several questions were not correct on the tests.  If you found the correct answers in the book, she would come back with a different excuse as to why she would not change the answer.
